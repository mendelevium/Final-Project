Mental illness has been the common denominator in one act of mass violence after another.

According to the National Institute of Mental Health%2C about 1 in 4 adults suffer from a mental disorder.

Blunt is co-sponsoring three Senate bills to offer solutions and draw attention to outdated policies.

Nearly six months after the tragic deaths of 26 students and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School, President Obama held a widely-publicized ""conference"" last week to finally discuss one of the most pressing challenges: fixing our broken mental health system.

While I'm pleased the president has finally turned his attention to mental health, I'm also disappointed it has taken so long. Instead of joining bipartisan efforts to address mental health reform immediately after the Sandy Hook tragedy, President Obama spent a great deal of time and political capital trying to pressure Congress into passing an unrelated gun bill -- legislation that failed to address the root cause of the deadly violence that we witnessed in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., and Tucson.

People with mental health problems are almost never dangerous. In fact, they are more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators. At the same time, mental illness has been the common denominator in one act of mass violence after another.

In Newtown, Adam Lanza's mother identified and expressed deep concerns surrounding her son's mental health before he brutally murdered her and 26 other innocent people. Yet as Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen rightly noted last month, ""even if miraculously enacted, the (president's gun control) bill would not have stopped 20-year-old Adam Lanza from his murderous rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School.""

Prior to James Holmes' theater rampage in Aurora, his University of Colorado psychiatrist was so alarmed by his behavior that she notified the campus-wide threat-assessment team. Unfortunately, the team did not move the matter forward because Holmes was leaving the university. In addition, his psychiatrist reportedly rejected a law enforcement offer to confine him for 72 hours after he told her six weeks before the shooting that he fantasized about killing ""a lot of people.""



In Tucson, Rep. Gabby Giffords' attempted assassin, Jared Loughner, reportedly exhibited signs of bizarre behavior and had five run-ins with Pima Community College police before he was ultimately suspended from the school. College officials ultimately informed Loughner that he would need to obtain assurances from a mental health official indicating ""his presence at the College does not present a danger to himself or others"" if he intended to return to school.

Mental illness is a widespread, but treatable, disease. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately ""one in four adults suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder"" every year nationwide. Unfortunately, as we saw in Newtown, Aurora and Tucson, the loved ones and community leaders closest to these individuals often lack the tools or knowledge to intervene before someone does something that tragically impacts their lives and the lives of others.

Before January of this year, the Senate committee that deals with mental health issues had not held a hearing devoted to this topic since 2007. The moment to talk about what we can do is now. That's why I've been working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for many months to offer solutions and draw attention to our nation's outdated mental health policies.

In February, I joined Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. to introduce the Excellence in Mental Health Act. This bill addresses our nation's fragmented mental health system by offering current Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) a chance to obtain the Federally Qualified Community Behavioral Health Center designation.

I also co-sponsored the Mental Health First Aid Act of 2013 to help people identify, understand and respond to the signs of mental illnesses and addiction disorders through a pilot program for mental health first aid training. And I co-sponsored the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Act to improve access to mental health services for people in the criminal justice system. This bill would give law enforcement officers the tools they need to identify and respond to mental health issues, while continuing to support mental health courts and crisis intervention teams.

These bills -- all of which have garnered bipartisan support -- are steps in the right direction. I will continue to encourage Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to allow stand-alone votes on mental health legislation, and I hope President Obama will work with members from both parties to improve our nation's policies before another mental health crisis results in senseless loss.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi is a California Democrat and the leader of Democrats in the House of Representatives. She met this week with USA TODAY's Editorial Board. Her comments were edited for length and clarity.

On the coming debt ceiling fight:

""Here's the thing -- the president is one of the most practically non-partisan presidents I have seen in the White House. I've been there since Ronald Reagan, and he really is working to try to get some bipartisan agreement. They've been working very hard to try to get the Senate consensus or some agreement on how we can avoid a shutdown of government but also how you can even remove all doubt that we're not going to honor the full faith in credit of the United States of America by lifting the debt ceiling. There are some glimmers, a possibility of coming to a grand bargain. The president is talking about a grand bargain for middle-income jobs, but the bigger, the grander the bargain the more you can accommodate, shall we say, other things you don't like so much. But weighing all the equities, this is the way that we need to go forward.

On how entitlement spending could help cut the deficit:

One of the things we did was pass the Affordable Care Act because the biggest contribution to the growth of the deficit has been the rapidly rising cost of health care. Prescription drugs, services, all the rest. And passing the ACA is already projected to save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years. And you see evidence of it now that the ACA is partially responsible for the reduction of the deficit. And that is really important because you have to reduce those costs. We had to pass the Affordable Care Act, even if everybody loved their health care and they loved their insurance company, which they didn't, but even if they did, the costs were unsustainable to individuals, to families, to businesses, to our country's competitiveness in the world. And so the Affordable Care Act not only accomplished what we want is good health for America, not just health care, prevention and wellness and health for America, but reducing the cost.

On the decision to postpone the ACA's employer mandate:

The president didn't postpone the mandate, he postponed the penalties for not engaging in the mandate. So you might say it's the same thing, but it's a technicality. When the (administration) informed us, I thought that that was fine. What it could lead to is some others looking for some postponement, which might be OK too. There's no bill that has ever been written that you can say every single thing in it on its timetable and in its specifics should never be changed. And to the extent that the president has the executive authority to do some changes, that's fine.

On the National Security Agency's Internet and phone data collection:

Here's the thing, I think that technology has been a friend in terms of protecting our national security. The balance between security and liberty has always been a challenge in our country. That's why I insisted on the establishment of the civil liberties and privacy board to be watchdog on how this is done. Congress has to make decisions about intelligence budgeting and policy. We need much more information. People say, well, Congress was informed. Well, yeah, but Congress changes. In the aggregate, we want Congress informed – not this one day and that another year and then say we told Congress. Yeah, we told Congress at large. We want Congress informed in aggregate.

On the court that supervises the NSA:

Let me say this -- when the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court was established and it was decided that the chief justice would name the judges, would anybody have thought the chief justice would name 10 people from one party and one of another? How do you allay concerns, fear, established trusts with that kind of appointments. So let's take a look at how those judges are appointed. I do think the appeal that is made to the court has to meet certain standards, and they probably do. But we shouldn't take that at face value. We should have a release of that information over a period of time."

Hof, who last year was tasked by then Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and Obama to lead US negotiations to resolve Syria’s civil war, said Obama’s last-minute switch to seek Congressional approval for a military strike in Syria undermined US authority in the world.

“By not making it clear from the outset of the crisis that he would seek the approval of the Senate and House for a military response to the Assad regime’s chemical atrocity,” Hof wrote, “the president’s jarring change of direction now runs the risk of thoroughly undermining whatever remains of allied confidence in his leadership.”

Hof writes that, “the events of the past ten days suggest that there was no administration forethought to the possibility of a major chemical incident in Syria; there was no plan in place to respond to a major chemical attack by a regime that had already demonstrated its deep and abiding contempt for the president and his red lines.”

Hof argues that Obama’s recent actions would lead many to believe that the decision to seek Congressional approval “is less a bow to American constitutionality than a further attempt to kick the can down the road.”

Obama didn’t seek Congressional approval for the military action he authorized in Libya. That action was directed at toppling the regime of Libyan dictator Gadaffi, a more intense and much broader objective than Obama says he wants in Syria. In his remarks on Saturday, Obama even stated that he believes he has the authority to order a strike on Syria. That he didn’t, Hof argues, nor call Congress immediately back to Washington, undermines US credibility in the world.

Hof is not some outside expert observing the seen from afar. He joined the Obama Administration at the start of the President’s first term as a special advisor of the Middle East. He worked closely with Clinton and Special Envoy George Mitchell on Middle East peace negotiations. He was the lead diplomat for issues related to Syria and Lebanon.

In March, 2012, President Obama elevated him to the rank of Ambassador and gave him responsibility for handling the US response to the deteriorating situation in Syria. He abruptly resigned the position just 6 months later. News of his resignation came just two works after the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya.

Hof’s critique of the Obama Administration is must reading for anyone trying to understand America’s increasingly feckless response to the events unfolding in Syria. Almost a year ago, President Obama told reporters that Syria’s use of chemical weapons was a “red line” that, if crossed would generate a US military response. It seems inconceivable that no contingency plans were draw up for just such an event. Yet, as Hof argues, that seems to be the case.

Congress doesn’t return to Washington until next week. Even if strong support builds for military intervention, it will likely be several days before Congress approves action. This gives the Assad regime at least two weeks to prepare for any possible US attack. The regime is no doubt, even today, moving its chemical weapons arsenal to unknown locations. The limited engagement Obama claims he wants may be completely ineffective.

As Hof laments, “there will be no ‘do-overs.'”"
http://news.yahoo.com/obama-visit-kenya-only-1-day-africa-far-161055464.html,,[],Obama visit to Kenya? Only 1 day in Africa so far,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — President Barack Obama promised to visit his father's homeland — Kenya — before the end of his presidency, but of the 51 country visits Obama made the last four years, America's first black president spent less than a day in sub-Saharan Africa. That could now change.

Presidential travel trends suggest Obama is likely to spend more time in Africa in his second term, a presidential historian said. Freed of domestic campaign politics, second-term presidents can travel more in a continent that has less strategic importance than Europe and Asia. A rising terror threat in Mali has also heightened the region's profile.

And then there's the promise: ""I'm positive that before my service as president is completed I will visit Kenya again,"" Obama said in a June 2010 interview with Kenya's state broadcaster.

That statement should mean a lot, because presidents don't make such promises lightly, said Brendon Doherty, an associate professor of political science at the U.S. Naval Academy who studies presidential travel patterns.

""Presidents do take special pleasure in traveling to places where they have ancestral ties,"" Doherty said, noting visits by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and even Obama to Ireland, where each had family ties. ""Given the large role that Africa plays in the family history of President Obama, I'd be really surprised if he didn't travel there in the second term.""

Both Clinton and President George W. Bush took extended trips through Africa in their second terms. Clinton visited six countries in sub-Saharan Africa; Bush visited five. Obama's only visit to sub-Saharan Africa as president was a stopover of less than 24 hours in Ghana. While a U.S. Senator, Obama visited Ethiopia and Kenya, where he has several relatives.

""He is a Kenyan who many people want to see in person. I am proud that he is a Kenyan and that he is the president of a superpower,"" said Sam Ochieng, a political leader in Nairobi's largest slum, Kibera.

Story continues

Laura Seay, assistant professor of political science at Morehouse College who runs a blog called Texas in Africa, said Africa is a low priority for most American presidents because of geopolitical interests and historical ties, ""and that was the case in the Obama administration."" She added, though, that Africa is becoming more important to U.S. foreign policy interests.

Even that one trip to Ghana was better than some predecessors. Clinton did not travel to sub-Saharan Africa in his first term, and Reagan never did. President George H.W. Bush traveled to Somalia; President Jimmy Carter, the first president to go to sub-Saharan Africa while in office, traveled to Nigeria.

An Associated Press review of presidential travel shows Europe and North America got the most visits during the Carter-to-Obama period. France led with 24 visits; the U.K. had 23; Canada and Germany had 20; Mexico and Italy had 19.

J. Peter Pham, an Africa specialist at the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C. think tank, noted that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made Africa a diplomatic priority in Obama's first term, visiting 23 of the continent's 54 countries. Pham said Obama has yet to fully deploy ""the immense personal capital"" he has on reserve in Africa.

The White House and State Department declined to comment on whether Obama will spend more time in Africa. Johnnie Carson, the State Department's top Africa official, said this month that the Obama administration has helped Somalia stabilize and South Sudan gain independence and that the U.S. has provided more aid to Africa the last four years than any other country.

Obama's national security adviser said in November that the president's time is the White House's most valuable resource, and Doherty said Obama's lack of time in Africa reflects compelling global priorities, not a lack of importance for Africa.

Though Obama's father is Kenyan, there is a perception that the younger George W. Bush did a lot more for Africa and Africans, said Seay, especially after the creation of the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, a $15 billion commitment to fight HIV/AIDS.

But even if Obama hopes to visit his father's homeland, he may not be able to politically if Kenya's March presidential election turns as violent as the last one. One top presidential contender faces trial at the International Criminal Court over accusations he orchestrated tribal violence that killed more than 1,000 Kenyans in 2007-08.

""It's certainly the case that presidents of both parties spend more time in countries that have long traditions of clean democratic elections,"" said Doherty, the author of ""The Rise of the President's Permanent Campaign."" ''I would not be surprised if the aftermath of the Kenyan elections last time added to the president's team's hesitance to send him to Kenya.""

Seay said that if this year's election goes smoothly, she wouldn't be surprised if Obama visits. Many in Kenya would love to see that happen.

""He is a symbol for hope, and a role model for upcoming politicians who can change the way Kenya is run by following his footsteps,"" said Ochieng, the Kenyan political leader. ""Kenyan politicians can learn from Obama that politics should be issue-based, not the tribal kind of politics we practice here.""

Special for USA TODAY

Politicians want answers from Obama administration

Two political parties staged separate protests at the U.S. Consulate

Most in Hong Kong assumed that China was to blame for any hacking episodes

HONG KONG — Politicians were asking for answers from the Obama administration on Thursday about allegations from an American computer analyst that a U.S. secret surveillance program hacked into Hong Kong computer systems.

Two political parties staged separate protests at the U.S. Consulate on Thursday, with the New Forum demonstrating against the alleged U.S. hacking in Hong Kong and China and the League of Social Democrats voicing support for Edward Snowden.

About a dozen people showed up for the protests; a larger one is planned for Saturday.

Civil Party leader Alan Leong Kah-kit said Snowden has raised a serious allegation and that Hong Kong should take the issue up with President Obama.

""The Hong Kong government should take the issue up and ask Obama whether it has been the case. It is the least it should do at the moment,"" he told the South China Morning Post newspaper.

Snowden, 29, fled to Hong Kong with a trove of classified material he allegedly stole from his job for a consulting firm doing work for the U.S. National Security Agency. He revealed to the news media details of an NSA program that sweeps up data on phone calls and e-mails in the United States to identify patterns of possible communications between terrorists.

Until Snowden divulged the secret program most in Hong Kong assumed that China was to blame for any hacking episodes, according to Simon Shen, co-director of the International Affairs Research Center at Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Snowden named Shen's university as one of hundreds of NSA targets in Hong Kong and mainland China in an interview published in Thursday's edition of the Post, but it was the only one he specifically identified.

Meanwhile, Leung Chun-ying, who heads Hong Kong's government as chief executive, repeatedly told an interviewer in New York with Bloomberg Television that he ""cannot comment on individual cases"" when asked about Snowden.

Asked specifically if the city would comply with a U.S. extradition request, he said, ""I can only say that we follow existing laws and policies.""

The Obama administration has not announced whether it has made such a request. Members of Congress, such as Peter King, R-N.Y., have been demanding to know why such a request has not been made, accusing Snowden of theft, violation of his security clearance oath and treason.

The White House has said it will not comment while an investigation is ongoing.

Hong Kong legislator James To told a local newspaper he was considering inviting Snowden to testify to the Legislative Council on cybersecurity and U.S. hacking activities.

""I am interested to know how vulnerable our cybersystems are, and I want to ask Mr Snowden questions and verify his claims,"" he said.

At Chinese University, Shen said he wasn't sure why the NSA might target his school but added, ""There are a few strategically important points in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.""

The school hosts the Hong Kong Internet eXchange, a service for routing Internet traffic within Hong Kong to avoid the need to use overseas servers.

In a statement, the school said, ""The university has not detected any form of hacking to the network"" and added that the exchange and the school's backbone network ""are closely monitored round-the-clock to ensure normal operation and defend against network threats.""

A government spokesman similarly said, ""the government has no reported hacking incidents involving data leakage on its computer systems,"" but added that agencies have put in place defenses to protect their systems. ""The government strives to combat all kinds of technology crime.""

Chinese University may have been of interest to the NSA beyond its infrastructure. University researchers are engaged in research projects with government counterparts in mainland China and elsewhere. Shen cited the example of the Dragon Programme, which is a joint project of the National Remote Sensing Center of China and the European Space Agency for Earth observation research and application development.

Chinese University also runs a joint program with the Chinese Academy of Sciences in ""advanced integration technology,"" a brain research project with China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences, a research center for ""radar remote sensing"" with the China Center for Resources Satellite Data and Applications and the Joint Center for Intelligent Sensing and Systems with the National University of Defense Technology, among others.

Historically, Shen noted, the university was a key research base for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency when Hong Kong was under British rule and China was closed to most Western visitors. It remains one of the leading research centers for scholars coming to study China.

In China, which the USA has said is involved in cyberattacks, officials said the revelations showed that it is America and not China that is committing such acts.

""I have always said, the United States' accusations about Chinese hacking attacks have always been a case of a thief crying for another thief to be caught,"" said Air Force Col. Dai Xu on his microblog site."

Obama says Iran shouldn’t misinterpret U.S. response to Syria

President Obama declared that the United States is still prepared to act militarily to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons despite the decision to pursue a diplomatic deal and not strike Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons.

He also acknowledged that his approach to the Syria crisis has been uneven, but defended it as producing the right results.

Obama spoke in an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos,” taped Friday before the United States and Russia agreed on a plan to bring Syrian chemical weapons under international control in order to avoid military strikes.

But Obama said Iran should not interpret the diplomatic response — coming after he threatened to use strikes — as suggesting that the United States wouldn’t attack Iran to stop the development of nuclear weapons.

“I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that the threat . . . against Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests,” Obama said. “My suspicion is that the Iranians recognize they shouldn’t draw a lesson that we haven’t struck [Syria] to think we won’t strike Iran.”

Washington Update: Summers bows out in bid for Fed Reserve chief

Obama said, however, that what the Iranians should draw from this episode is that it is possible to resolve this type of disagreement diplomatically.

“My view is that if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that, in fact you can . . . strike a deal,” he said, confirming that he had communicated with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani by letter.

Obama also defended his approach to the Syrian crisis, acknowledging that it has been turbulent, but insisting that it has achieved the right results.

The comments come after a number of lawmakers and foreign policy experts on both sides of the aisle have criticized Obama for first making the case to go to war in Syria, then deciding to ask Congress for approval, and then making the case for strikes to a prime-time audience while also announcing that he would first give a Russian diplomatic proposal a chance to work.

In response to those criticisms, Obama said he is less interested in style than results.

“I think that folks here in Washington like to grade on style. And so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy. We know that, because that’s exactly how they graded the Iraq war,” Obama said.

He added, “I’m much more concerned about getting the policy right. . . . As a consequence of the steps that we’ve taken over the last two weeks to three weeks, we now have a situation in which Syria has acknowledged it has chemical weapons, has said it’s willing to join the convention on chemical weapons, and Russia, its primary sponsor, has said that it will pressure Syria to reach that agreement. That’s my goal. And if that goal is achieved, then it sounds to me like we did something right.”

Obama also played down differences with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin as Russia and the United States work together to resolve the Syria standoff.

“Mr. Putin and I have strong disagreements on a whole range of issues,” Obama said. “But I can talk to him. We have worked together on important issues. . . . This is not the Cold War. This is not a contest between the United States and Russia.”

Obama plans to pivot back to a focus on the economy this week ahead of major fiscal battles in Congress, and he said he could change the direction of the economy — including the upward path of inequality — if Congress would let him.

Asked if a president just couldn’t stop inequality, he responded, “I think the president can stop it. The problem is that there continues to be a major debate here in Washington.”

While he acknowledged that government can’t overcome every trend in the market, policy that invests in the economy “pushes against these trends. And the problem that we’ve got right now is you’ve got a portion of Congress whose policies don’t just want to you know, leave things alone; they actually want to accelerate these trends.”"

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin bluntly rejected U.S. pleas to extradite National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden on Tuesday, saying Snowden is free to travel wherever he wants and insisting that Russian security agencies haven't contacted him.

Snowden is in the transit zone of a Moscow airport and has not passed through Russian immigration, Putin said, meaning he is not technically in Russia.

After arriving Sunday on a flight from Hong Kong, Snowden booked a seat on a Havana-bound flight from Moscow on Monday en route to Venezuela and then possible asylum in Ecuador, but he didn't board the plane.

Snowden's whereabouts since then have been a mystery, and Putin's comments were the first time Russia has made clear it knows where he is.

Speculation has been rife that Russian security agencies might want to keep Snowden in Russia for a more thorough debriefing, but Putin denied that.

""Our special services never worked with Mr. Snowden and aren't working with him today,"" Putin said at a news conference during a visit to Finland.

Putin said that because there is no extradition agreement with the U.S., it couldn't meet the U.S. request.

""Mr. Snowden is a free man, and the sooner he chooses his final destination the better it is for us and for him,"" Putin said. ""I hope it will not affect the business-like character of our relations with the U.S. and I hope that our partners will understand that.""

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that though the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, it wants Moscow to comply with common law practices between countries where fugitives are concerned.

Putin's staunch refusal to consider Snowden's extradition reflects the Russian president's readiness to further challenge Washington at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are already strained over Syria and a Russian ban on adoptions by Americans.

A Kremlin decision to provide even temporary shelter and safe transit to Snowden would embarrass Washington. And despite Putin's denial, analysts believe Russian special services wouldn't miss the chance to question the man who is believed to hold reams of classified U.S. documents.

Russia also relished using Snowden's revelations to try to turn the tables on U.S. criticism of Russia's rights record.

Putin compared Snowden to WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who has been provided asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, saying that both men were labeled criminals but consider themselves rights activists and champions of freedom of information.

""Ask yourself a question: should people like that be extradited so that they put them in prison or not?"" he said. ""In any case, I would prefer not to deal with such issues. It's like shearing a piglet: a lot of squealing and little wool.""

In an apparent reference to claims that Moscow could have played a role in Snowden's exit from Hong Kong, he said that his arrival was a ""complete surprise"" and dismissed accusations against Russia as ""ravings and sheer nonsense.""

""He doesn't need a visa or any other documents, and as a transit passenger he has the right to buy a ticket and fly wherever he wants,"" Putin said.

Russian news media had reported Snowden remained in a transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, but journalists there haven't seen him.

Legally, an arriving air passenger ""crosses the border"" after clearing immigration checks.

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the U.S. push for Snowden's extradition earlier Tuesday, but wouldn't specify his whereabouts, saying only that he hasn't crossed the Russian border.

""We consider the attempts to accuse Russia of violating U.S. laws and even some sort of conspiracy, which on top of all that are accompanied by threats, as absolutely ungrounded and unacceptable,"" Lavrov said. ""There are no legal grounds for such conduct by U.S. officials.""

U.S. and Ecuadorean officials had said they believed Snowden was still in Russia.

Kerry called for ""calm and reasonableness.""

""We would hope that Russia would not side with someone who is `a fugitive' from justice,' "" Kerry said at a news conference in Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport.

A representative of WikiLeaks has been traveling with Snowden, and the organization is believed to be assisting him in arranging asylum. Assange, the group's founder, said Monday that Snowden was only passing through Russia and had applied for asylum in Ecuador, Iceland and possibly other countries.

A high-ranking Ecuadorean official told The Associated Press that Russia and Ecuador were discussing where Snowden could go, saying the process could take days. He also said Ecuador's ambassador to Moscow had not seen or spoken to Snowden. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patino, hailed Snowden on Monday as ""a man attempting to bring light and transparency to facts that affect everyone's fundamental liberties.""

""We're following all the appropriate legal channels and working with various other countries to make sure that the rule of law is observed,"" President Barack Obama told reporters.

The Kremlin has previously said Russia would be ready to consider Snowden's request for asylum.

Snowden is a former CIA employee who later was hired as a contractor for the NSA. In that job, he gained access to documents that he gave to newspapers the Guardian and The Washington Post to expose what he contends are privacy violations by an authoritarian government.

Snowden also told the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong that ""the NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data."" He is believed to have more than 200 additional sensitive documents in laptops he is carrying.

Some observers said in addition to the sensitive data, Snowden's revelations have provided the Kremlin with propaganda arguments to counter the U.S. criticism of Russia's crackdown on opposition and civil activists under Putin.

""They would use Snowden to demonstrate that the U.S. government doesn't sympathize with the ideals of freedom of information, conceals key information from the public and stands ready to open criminal proceedings against those who oppose it,"" Konstantin Remchukov, the editor of independent daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta, said on Ekho Moskvy radio.

Putin has accused the U.S. State Department of instigating protests in Moscow against his re-election for a third term in March and has taken an anti-American posture that plays well with his core support base of industrial workers and state employees.

Baltasar Garzón, the renowned Spanish jurist who advises WikiLeaks, said in a statement that “what is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange — for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest — is an assault against the people.”

Obama administration officials privately expressed frustration that Hong Kong allowed Mr. Snowden to board an Aeroflot plane bound for Moscow on Sunday despite the American request for his detention. But they did not revoke Mr. Snowden’s passport until Saturday and did not ask Interpol to issue a “red notice” seeking his arrest.

An administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said no red notice was requested because they are “most valuable when the whereabouts of a fugitive are unknown.” Mr. Snowden was known to be in Hong Kong, so his provisional arrest was sought under an existing American agreement with Hong Kong.

On Sunday, the Hong Kong authorities said that the American arrest request “did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law,” and therefore they could not legally stop Mr. Snowden from leaving. The Justice Department rejected this explanation and provided a timeline of interactions suggesting that the Hong Kong authorities first requested “additional information” on Friday.

“At no point, in all of our discussions through Friday, did the authorities in Hong Kong raise any issues regarding the sufficiency of the U.S.'s provisional arrest request,” a department official said. “In light of this, we find their decision to be particularly troubling.”

By the end of the day American officials, unsure whether Mr. Snowden was actually heading to Ecuador, or possibly Cuba or Venezuela, as also variously reported, were sending messages to an array of possible destinations."
http://news.yahoo.com/kerry--u-s--will-respond-to-%E2%80%98moral-obscenity%E2%80%99-of-syria-massacre--193453624.html,,[],Kerry: U.S. will respond to ‘moral obscenity’ of Syria massacre,"Secretary of State John Kerry left no doubt Monday that the United States believes Syria’s Bashar Assad used chemical weapons to slaughter civilians last week and vowed that the United States will respond to that “moral obscenity.”

“Anyone who can claim that an attack of this staggering scale could be contrived or fabricated needs to check their conscience and their own moral compass,” he said, in a barb likely meant for Syria and its patron Russia. “By any standard it is inexcusable, and despite the excuses and equivocations that some have manufactured, it is undeniable.""

Kerry, speaking to reporters at the State Department, spoke of the attack in very personal terms, describing how he had watched the “gut-wrenching” videos of the dead and dying via social media. But he gave no details about when a decision on whether to use force in response to last week’s massacre might come — or whether it would.

The secretary of state said the United States government and its allies were reviewing nonpublic information about the alleged attack and promised that “we will provide that information in the days ahead.”

“Make no mistake, President (Barack) Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world’s most heinous weapons against the world’s most vulnerable people,” Kerry warned. “Nothing today is more serious and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny.”

The top U.S. diplomat offered no new public evidence to back up U.S. charges that the Assad regime used chemical weapons in an attack just outside Damascus that anti-Assad fighters say might have killed more than 1,300. But he made a public case against the Syrian strongman that might underpin a future legal rationale for American military strikes.

""While investigators are gathering additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts informed by conscience and guided by common sense,"" Kerry said. ""The reported number of victims, the reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, the firsthand accounts from humanitarian organizations on the ground like Doctors Without Borders and the Syria Human Rights Commission — these all strongly indicate that everything these images are already screaming at us is real, that chemical weapons were used in Syria.""

Story continues

Syria possesses chemical weapons, and the rockets to deliver them, Kerry said. ""We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place. And with our own eyes, we have all of us become witnesses.""

And Kerry shared his personal response to shocking social media videos shared by the opposition.

After a round of telephone diplomacy on Sunday, Kerry said, “I went back and I watched videos — videos that anybody can watch on social media — I watched them one more gut-wrenching time.”

“As a father, I can’t get the image out of my head, of a man who held up his dead child, wailing, while chaos swirled around,” he said.

“The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity,” he underlined.

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would explain his decision to the American public once he has made it and already has started reaching out to key members of Congress.

Asked whether polls showing weak U.S. public support for intervention would shape the president's decision, Carney replied: ""The president makes decisions about military action or potential military action with the national security interests of the United States in mind.""

""I am sure that you will hear from him."""

At 15, a gang member shot at him while he was shopping at a grocery store — and killed his cousin instead.

At 17, he left Honduras for the United States.

He applied for political asylum, telling a judge that if he returned home, the gang that had slain his father would kill him, too.

Now 20, working as a gardener and living with his mother and siblings in Los Angeles, the man is one of a growing number of Central Americans asking for asylum. His claim was denied, and lawyers from the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles are helping him appeal. He asked not to be identified because he fears for his safety.

In the last five years, “credible fear” applications at the border have increased sevenfold, from just under 5,000 to more than 36,000, driven largely by an influx from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.

Advocates for the immigrants say the surge can be traced to worsening gang and drug violence in Central America. Others say people who cross the border are simply becoming more aware of asylum as an option.

“People used to think the only thing you could do was sneak across,” said Judy London, directing attorney of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the Los Angeles pro bono law firm Public Counsel. “They’ve learned that you can just go up to a border agent and tell them you want asylum.”

With the jump in asylum applications has come concerns about possible fraud and abuse.

On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing to address reports that the asylum system is being exploited, including by Mexican drug traffickers.

“If indeed we allow that process to be abused … then those that we disserve the most are those who are genuinely persecuted,” said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.).

Even with the recent increase, the number of asylum seekers is lower now than in the early 1990s, when a coup in Haiti and a court settlement in favor of Central Americans resulted in a flood of claims.

Most asylum applications are still made from inside the country, rather than by claiming credible fear at the border. People who are in the U.S. legally — on a tourist or business visa, for example — file “affirmative” applications, which have also increased, though not as rapidly as credible fear applications. Combined, the two categories have more than doubled in the last five years, exceeding 80,000 in fiscal year 2013. The number of people winning asylum has increased only slightly, with about 30,000 cases approved in 2012.

Statistics show that an immigrant’s chance of winning asylum depends largely on where he or she is from.

In 2012, more than 10,000 people from China were granted asylum, compared with just 126 Mexicans and 234 Hondurans, according to federal data. Immigration court figures, which do not include cases approved in an initial hearing by an asylum officer, show a success rate of nearly 50% for Chinese versus 1% for Mexicans.

Still, the process buys time. Almost 90% of credible fear applicants pass an initial screening interview, which allows them to live and work in the U.S. until their cases are resolved — often a matter of years.

To qualify for asylum, a person must have suffered persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. If the persecutor is not the government, the applicant must show that the government failed to offer protection.

Chinese immigrants typically claim they were persecuted by the government for belonging to an underground church or trying to have a second child. It is harder to win asylum when the oppressor is a non-state actor such as a gang.

“Central America is a war zone more violent than the days of the civil wars,” said Deborah Anker, director of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program. “But we’ve been denying these cases systematically.”

U.S. foreign policy is also a factor in which asylum cases get approved, according to Bill Ong Hing, a law professor at the University of San Francisco.

“No matter what we say in terms of the law being neutral, the U.S. continues to favor applicants fleeing from quote unquote communist-dominated countries,” Hing said. “Policywise, the U.S. is trying to support the governments of Central America and Mexico; so politically, the U.S. has that in the back of its mind in asylum adjudications.”

Still, immigration attorney Eric Price tells his Mexican and Central American clients that it may be worth filing an asylum case, even if they end up losing.

“Three uncertain years in the safety of L.A. is much better than three years of certain threat in Guatemala,” Price said. Besides, he added, the denial of asylum doesn’t always result in a deportation order, thanks to an initiative by President Obama that allows immigration officials discretion in whom they deport.

At last week’s congressional hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) accused some asylum seekers of “gaming the system,” adding: “They essentially get free education, free healthcare.”

Fraud has been an issue, with underground asylum industries thriving in some ethnic communities.

Last year in New York, 26 people, including six attorneys, were indicted on charges that they manufactured asylum claims and coached Chinese clients on how to lie to immigration authorities. One church employee allegedly provided religious training so applicants could pass as Christians.

Thomas Mayer, a San Gabriel immigration attorney, said Chinese immigrants sometimes ask him to make up a persecution story for them. He refuses, but the demand is growing.

To weed out impostors, Mayer administers a quiz: “Name two important Christian holidays. What is baptism? Who was John the Baptist?”

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for a more restrictive immigration system, said asylum should be limited to those fleeing repressive governments or genocide.

“Giving asylum to all kinds of people who are just using it as a path to a green card is not right,” Krikorian said. “Only by keeping the bar high, so the only ones who get asylum are the ones who are really, really deserving, can it remain politically viable.”

But immigration attorneys say the bar can be too high.

“It doesn’t make sense to me why you have to have your feet amputated before you could qualify for asylum in the U.S.,” said David Bennion, a Philadelphia immigration attorney. He is representing the Dream 30, a group of young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children, recently returned to Mexico or Central America and have now filed for asylum.

He is basing their claims on an untested theory: that people who have spent most of their lives in the U.S. speak and dress differently, making them targets because they are thought to have wealthy relatives.

“Judges are not shocked to hear a Chinese national say he worshiped in an underground church,” said Bruce Einhorn, a former immigration judge who directs the asylum clinic at Pepperdine University School of Law. But, he said, “a lot of judges get Mexican asylum cases and say out loud, ‘Mexico? Mexico?’”

For the time being, attorneys say, physical scars and extensive documentation are often required for a case from Latin America to be taken seriously.

The immigrant from Honduras, who is haunted by his cousin’s death, is sure he will die if he returns. The nation’s gangs, he said, are merciless: “They don’t stop bothering you until they kill you.”

Regarding institutional derangements, he is the infection against which he pretends to be an immunization.

In the Illinois legislature, he voted “present” 129 times to avoid difficulties; now he stoops from his executive grandeur to tutor Congress on accountability. In Washington, where he condescends as a swan slumming among starlings, he insists that, given the urgency of everything he desires, he “can’t wait” for Congress to vote on his programs or to confirm persons he nominates to implement them. The virtues of his policies and personnel are supposedly patent and sufficient to justify imposing both by executive decrees.

In foreign policy, too, he luxuriates in acting, as most modern presidents have improvidently done, without the tiresome persuasion required to earn congressional ratifications. Without even a precipitating event such as Syria’s poison gas attack, and without any plausible argument that an emergency precluded deliberation, he waged protracted war against Libya with bombers and cruise missiles but without Congress.

Now, concerning Syria, he lectures Congress, seeking an accomplice while talking about accountability. Perhaps he deserves Congress’s complicity — if he can convince it that he can achieve a success he can define. If success is a “shot across the bow” of Syria’s regime, he cannot fail: By avoiding the bow, such a shot merely warns of subsequent actions.

Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has advertised his skepticism about intervening in Syria. His very public intrusion into a policy debate may exceed what is proper for the uniformed military, but he seems to have played Obama as dexterously as Duke Ellington played a piano. Dempsey assured Obama that the military mission could be accomplished a month from now. (Because the bow will still be there to be shot across?) This enabled Obama to say that using the military to affirm an international norm (about poison gas), although urgent enough to involve Congress, is not so urgent that Congress’s recess required abbreviation.

Britain’s Parliament inadvertently revived the constitutional standing of Congress when British Prime Minister David Cameron’s incompetent management of the parliament’s vote resulted in the body refusing to authorize an attack. His fumble was a function of Obama’s pressuring him for haste. If Parliament had authorized an attack — seven switched votes would have sufficed — Obama probably would already have attacked, without any thought about Congress’s prerogatives. The Financial Times’s Gideon ­Rachman reports that, in an Aug. 24 telephone conversation with Cameron, Obama “made it clear that he wanted a swift military response — before global outrage dissipated and Bashar al-Assad’s regime had the chance to prepare its defenses.”

Many Republicans are reluctant to begin yet another military intervention in a distant and savage civil war. Other Republicans, whose appetite for such interventions has not been satiated by recent feasts of failure, will brand reluctance as “isolationism.”

Reluctant Republicans can invoke Dwight Eisenhower. He, who in 1961 enriched America’s lexicon with the phrase “military-industrial complex,” sought the presidency in 1952 to prevent its capture by what he considered an isolationist, or at least insufficiently internationalist, Republican faction represented by “Mr. Republican,” Ohio Sen. Robert Taft. Yet after one look as president-elect at the front line in Korea, Eisenhower ended that war. To advisers urging intervention on France’s behalf in Vietnam, he said (this from his memoirs): “Employment of airstrikes alone to support French troops in the jungle would create a double jeopardy: it would comprise an act of war and would also entail the risk of having intervened and lost.” He was not an interventionist regarding the 1956 Hungarian revolution, and he not only refused to support the 1956 British-French-Israeli attack on Egypt, he ruthlessly forced its termination. About his brief and tranquil intervention in Lebanon, he wrote: “I had been careful to use [about U.S. forces] the term ‘stationed in’ Lebanon.”

Obama’s sanctimony about his moral superiority to a Congress he considers insignificant has matched his hypocrisy regarding his diametrically opposed senatorial and presidential understandings of the proper modalities regarding uses of military force. Now he asks from the Congress he disdains an authorization he considers superfluous. By asking, however reluctantly, he begins the urgent task of lancing the boil of executive presumption. Surely he understands the perils of being denied an authorization he has sought, and then treating the denial as irrelevant.

He went to look for his father, whom he hadn’t seen for years. He left a note for his mother explaining that he missed his father and wanted to find him, and asking her to forgive him for leaving without permission.

A couple of days after Abdulrahman left, we were relieved to receive word that he was safe and with cousins in southern Yemen, where our family is from. Days later, his father was targeted and killed by American drones in a northern province, hundreds of miles away. After Anwar died, Abdulrahman called us and said he was going to return home.

That was the last time I heard his voice. He was killed just two weeks after his father.

A country that believes it does not even need to answer for killing its own is not the America I once knew. From 1966 to 1977, I fulfilled a childhood dream and studied in the United States as a Fulbright scholar, earning my doctorate and then working as a researcher and assistant professor at universities in New Mexico, Nebraska and Minnesota.

I have fond memories of those years. When I first came to the United States as a student, my host family took me camping by the ocean and on road trips to places like Yosemite, Disneyland and New York — and it was wonderful.

After returning to Yemen, I used my American education and skills to help my country, serving as Yemen’s minister of agriculture and fisheries and establishing one of the country’s leading institutions of higher learning, Ibb University. Abdulrahman used to tell me he wanted to follow in my footsteps and go back to America to study. I can’t bear to think of those conversations now.

After Anwar was put on the government’s list, but before he was killed, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights represented me in a lawsuit challenging the government’s claim that it could kill anyone it deemed an enemy of the state.

The court dismissed the case, saying that I did not have standing to sue on my son’s behalf and that the government’s targeted killing program was outside the court’s jurisdiction anyway."

Although there is no evidence that al-Qaeda has forced a drone crash or interfered with flight operations, U.S. intelligence officials have closely tracked the group’s persistent efforts to develop a counterdrone strategy since 2010, the documents show.

Al-Qaeda commanders are hoping a technological breakthrough can curb the U.S. drone campaign, which has killed an estimated 3,000 people over the past decade. The airstrikes have forced ­al-Qaeda operatives and other militants to take extreme measures to limit their movements in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and other places. But the drone attacks have also taken a heavy toll on civilians, generating a bitter popular backlash against U.S. policies toward those countries.

Details of al-Qaeda’s attempts to fight back against the drone campaign are contained in a classified intelligence report provided to The Washington Post by Edward Snowden, the fugitive former National Security Agency contractor. The top-secret report, titled “Threats to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,” is a summary of dozens of intelligence assessments posted by U.S. spy agencies since 2006.

U.S. intelligence analysts noted in their assessments that information about drone operational systems is available in the public realm. But The Post is withholding some detailed portions of the classified material that could shed light on specific weaknesses of certain aircraft.

Under President Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, drones have revolutionized warfare and become a pillar of the U.S. government’s counterterrorism strategy, enabling the CIA and the military to track down enemies in some of the remotest parts of the planet. Drone strikes have left al-Qaeda’s core leadership in Pakistan scrambling to survive.

U.S. spy agencies have concluded that al-Qaeda faces “substantial” challenges in devising an effective way to attack drones, according to the top-secret report disclosed by Snowden. Still, U.S. officials and aviation experts acknowledge that unmanned aircraft have a weak spot: the satellite links and remote controls that enable pilots to fly them from thousands of miles away.

In July 2010, a U.S. spy agency intercepted electronic communications indicating that senior al-Qaeda leaders had distributed a “strategy guide” to operatives around the world advising them how “to anticipate and defeat” unmanned aircraft. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported that al-Qaeda was sponsoring simultaneous research projects to develop jammers to interfere with GPS signals and infrared tags that drone operators rely on to pinpoint missile targets.

Other projects in the works included the development of observation balloons and small radio-controlled aircraft, or hobby planes, which insurgents apparently saw as having potential for monitoring the flight patterns of U.S. drones, according to the report.

Al-Qaeda cell leaders in the tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan were “determining the practical application of technologies being developed for battlefield applications,” analysts from the DIA wrote. The analysts added that they believed al-Qaeda “cell leadership is tracking the progress of each project and can redirect components from one project to another.”

The technological vulnerabilities of drones are no secret. The U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board issued an unclassified report two years ago warning that “increasingly capable adversaries” in countries such as Afghanistan could threaten drone operations by inventing inexpensive countermeasures.

The board said insurgents might try to use “lasers and dazzlers” to render a drone ineffective by blinding its cameras and sensors. It also predicted that insurgents might use rudimentary acoustic receivers to detect drones and “simple jammer techniques” to interfere with navigation and communications.

Researchers have since proved that the threat is not just theoretical. Last year, a research team from the University of Texas at Austin demonstrated to the Department of Homeland Security that it was possible to commandeer a small civilian drone by “spoofing” its GPS signal with a ground transmitter and charting a different navigational course.

Trained engineers

Al-Qaeda has a long history of attracting trained engineers and others with a scientific background. Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-proclaimed architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, holds a mechanical-engineering degree and is such an inveterate tinkerer that the CIA allowed him to fiddle around with new designs for a vacuum cleaner after he was captured a decade ago.

In 2010, the CIA noted in a secret report that al-Qaeda was placing special emphasis on the recruitment of technicians and that “the skills most in demand” included expertise in drones and missile technology. In July of that year, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, an al-Qaeda operations chief, told a jihadist Web site that the network did not need “ordinary fighters” and that it was looking instead for “specialist staff” to join the organization.

That same year, authorities in Turkey said they arrested an al-Qaeda member who was developing plans to shoot down small NATO surveillance drones in Afghanistan. The suspect, a 23-year-old mathematics student, was using software to conduct ballistics research for drone attacks, according to Turkish officials.

Al-Qaeda leaders have become increasingly open about their ­anti-drone efforts. In March, a new English-language online jihadist magazine called Azan published a story titled “The Drone Chain.” The article derided drone armaments as “evil missiles designed by the devils of the world” but reassured readers that jihadists had been working on “various technologies” to hack, manipulate and destroy unmanned aircraft.

At the same time, the magazine indicated that those efforts needed a boost, and it issued an emergency plea for scientific help: “Any opinions, thoughts, ideas and practical implementations to defeat this drone technology must be communicated to us as early as possible because these would aid greatly . . . against the crusader- zionist enemy.”

In the absence of a high-tech silver bullet, al-Qaeda affiliates around the world have taken to sharing hard-earned lessons about the importance of basic defensive measures.

Islamist extremists in North Africa this year distributed a photocopied tipsheet with 22 recommendations for avoiding drone strikes. Among the suggestions are several ideas for camouflage as well as dubious advice on using radio or microwave transmitters to “confuse the frequencies used to control the drone.”

The Associated Press in February found a copy of the tipsheet in Mali, left behind by Islamist fighters fleeing the city of Timbuktu. It was written by a jihadist in Yemen two years earlier and has circulated among al-Qaeda franchises since then.

‘GPS jamming capability’

In January 2011, U.S. intelligence agencies detected an unusual electronic signal emanating from near Miran Shah, a jihadist haven in North Waziristan, Pakistan. The DIA called the signal “the first observed test of a new terrorist GPS jamming capability.”

The test apparently did not pose a threat to military GPS frequencies or encrypted communications links. In addition, whoever was beaming the mysterious signal mistakenly thought that jamming ground-based GPS receivers would interfere with drones’ ability to aim missiles or munitions at fixed targets, according to the DIA report.

Despite such missteps, ­al-Qaeda has been undeterred. In a separate 2011 report, the DIA stated that affiliates in Miran Shah and the Pakistani city of Karachi were pursuing other “R&D projects,” including one effort to shoot down drones with portable shoulder-fired missiles, known as manpads.

Army intelligence analysts uncovered similar projects, including attempts to develop laser detectors that could give warning whenever a U.S. Predator drone was about to fire a laser-guided Hellfire missile, according to a summary of a classified Army report.

In 2011, the DIA concluded that an “al-Qaeda-affiliated research and development cell currently lacks the technical knowledge to successfully integrate and deploy a counterdrone strike system.” DIA analysts added, however, that if al-Qaeda engineers were to “overcome these substantial design challenges, we believe such a system probably would be highly disruptive for U.S. operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.”

The Air Force and CIA rely heavily on Predator and Reaper drones to hunt for al-Qaeda targets and other insurgents in several countries. Both aircraft can stay aloft for more than 20 hours to conduct surveillance missions and can be armed with Hellfire missiles.

The drones are flown by remote control via satellite data links, usually by pilots and sensor operators stationed thousands of miles away at bases in the United States. Those satellite links are encrypted, which makes the connections extremely difficult to hack.

It is only slightly less of a challenge for al-Qaeda fighters to spot a high-flying drone with the naked eye. Predators and Reapers loiter at altitudes above 20,000 feet, and their powerful cameras focus on objects several miles over the horizon, so their presence is hard to detect.

The satellite links, however, are the Achilles’ heel of drone operations. “Lost link” incidents — triggered when a satellite moves out of range or a drone drops a signal — are relatively common. The connections are usually reestablished within seconds or minutes. The aircraft are programmed to fly in a loop pattern or return to their launching spot during prolonged disruptions.

On several occasions, however, lost links have led to crashes. In September, an Air Force Predator slammed into mountainous terrain along the Iraq-Turkey border after the satellite data links were lost and the drone crew could no longer communicate with the aircraft.

In December 2011, a stealth U.S. spy drone operated by the CIA crashed in Iranian territory. Iran said it downed the advanced RQ-170 drone in an “electronic ambush.” U.S. officials said they did not believe that the drone had been hacked or jammed. They said a technical malfunction was probably to blame.

Although the navigational satellite links are encrypted, other drone transmissions are sometimes left unprotected.

In 2009, the U.S. military discovered that Iraqi insurgents had hacked into video feeds from Predator and Shadow drones using off-the-shelf software. The drones had been transmitting full-motion video to U.S. troops on the ground, but the Air Force had not encrypted those data links, leaving them vulnerable.

Air Force officials acknowledged the flaw and said they would work to encrypt all video feeds from its fleet of Predator drones by 2014. In their classified assessments, U.S. intelligence agencies sought to play down the insurgents’ hacking handiwork. Although analysts were concerned about the interceptions of the video feeds, they said there was no sign that insurgents had been able to seize control of the drone itself.

“While the ability of insurgent forces to view unencrypted or to break into encrypted data streams has been a concern for some time, indications to date are that insurgents have not been able to wrest [drone] control from its mission control ground station,” a 2010 report concluded.

The report went on to suggest that allowing insurgents to intercept video feeds might actually have “a deterrent effect” by demonstrating the extent to which U.S. forces were able to watch their movements.

Growing unease

Still, summaries of the classified reports indicate a growing unease among U.S. agencies about al-Qaeda’s determination to find a way to neutralize drones.

“Al-Qaida Engineers in Pakistan Continue Development of Laser-Warning Systems in Effort To Counter UAV Strikes,” read the headline of one report in 2011, using the military acronym for unmanned aerial vehicles.

Beyond the threat that ­al-Qaeda might figure out how to hack or shoot down a drone, however, U.S. spy agencies worried that their drone campaign was becoming increasingly vulnerable to public opposition.

Intelligence analysts took careful note of al-Qaeda’s efforts to portray drone strikes as cowardly or immoral, beginning in January 2011 with a report titled “Al-Qa’ida Explores Manipulating Public Opinion to Curb CT Pressure.”

Analysts also questioned whether they were losing the rhetorical battle in the media, the courts and even among “citizens with legitimate social agendas.” One 2010 report predicted that drone operations “could be brought under increased scrutiny, perceived to be illegitimate, openly resisted or undermined.”

In response, intelligence agencies floated their own ideas to influence public perceptions. One unclassified report said the phrase “drone strike” should never be uttered, calling it “a loaded term.”

“Drones connote mindless automatons with no capability for independent thought or action,” the report said. “Strikes connote a first attack, which leaves the victim unable to respond. Other phrases employed to evoke an emotional response include ‘Kill List,’ ‘Hit Squads,’ ‘Robot Warfare,’ or ‘Aerial Assassins.’ ”

Instead, the report advised referring to “lethal UAV operations.” It also suggested “elevating the conversation” to more-abstract issues, such as the “Inherent Right of Self-Defense” and “Pre-emptive and Preventive Military Action.”

""It became apparent to all of us quickly that this was not a demonstration, this was a violent attack,"" Ham said. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton initially had portrayed the embassy attack as a response to an inflammatory internet video.

Ham said he was in Washington D.C. for a routine meeting on September 11, 2012 with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Martin Dempsey, when an alert came in from commanders in Stuttgart, Germany that a violent assault was underway on the consulate in Benghazi and Ambassador Chris Stevens was missing.

Asked if it was a terrorist attack, Ham said the intelligence left no doubt that it was.

“I don't know if that was my first reaction, but pretty quickly as we started to gain understanding within the hours after the initiation of the attack, yes.""

While Ham did not address reports he was pushed into retirement after Benghazi, he said a quick response to the attack was not possible -- and he defended the decision not to scramble fighter jets.

""It was perfectly understandable to me why people would say you should have done that (but) in my military judgment, there was not a necessity and there was not a clear purpose in doing so.""

Ham's public assessment, believed to be his first since the attack that left four Americans dead, including Stevens, bears special weight since he was the regional commander for Africa.His comments last weekend are in line with those of his former boss, Panetta, who testified before the Senate Armed Services committee in February.

""When I later found out that you had RPGs and mortars and there was an attack on that second facility, there was no question in my mind it was a terrorist attack,""then Defense Secretary Panetta said.

Asked why Clinton initially blamed an internet video for the attack -- calling it a ""response to inflammatory material posted on the internet"" -- when senior military officials knew the day of the attack it was terrorism, the State Department Monday tried to portray the disconnect as old news.

""I'm not going to litigate what's already been evaluated,""said spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

""This Administration has always been clear that violent extremists were involved in this attack,"" Psaki said. ""The question was who exactly they were and whether there was also a demonstration at the same time. It now appears that there wasn’t, despite the intelligence assessment at the time.

In a letter to Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry, Republican Congressman Frank Wolf, is pressing the administration to explain why it has not used the military to detain five Benghazi suspects.

Ham told the Aspen conference he believed the fragile government in Libya was to blame for the investigation's lack of progress."

Karzai made the deal with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran Sunday.

""Afghanistan agreed on a long-term friendship and cooperation pact with Iran,"" Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi said, according to Reuters. ""The pact will be for long-term political, security, economic and cultural cooperation, regional peace and security.""

Afghanistan signed a cooperation pact with Iran in August covering mainly security issues, but Faizi said the proposed new agreement would have a broader scope.

Rouhani said Sunday his country opposes the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan and the region, saying their presence generates tension, the official IRNA news agency reported.

IRNA quoted Rouhani as telling Karzai: ""We believe that all foreign forces should leave the region and that the security of Afghanistan should be handed over to people of the country.""

""We are concerned about tensions caused by foreign forces' presence in the region,"" Rouhani was quoted as saying. He also called for more cooperation between Tehran and Kabul.

Iran has long opposed a planned agreement to allow U.S. forces to remain stationed on its doorstep in neighboring Afghanistan. The two countries have about 580 miles of common borders.

Rouhani also said Iran opposes any foreign forces in the region, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet has a base in the tiny kingdom of Bahrain.

On Saturday, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel laid out steps to beef up defense cooperation between states within the Gulf region, while at the same time insisting that America's military commitment to the Middle East will continue.

In a speech Saturday to Gulf leaders he also made it clear that the emerging global agreement that would limit Iran's nuclear program doesn't mean the security threat from the Islamic republic is over.

Iran's Defense Minister Gen. Hosein Dehghan called the remarks by his American counterpart ""threatening"" on Sunday, adding that they pave the ground for mistrust toward the U.S. while revealing the influence of Israel -- Iran's arch enemy -- on Washington.

Iran believes that countries of the Gulf are capable of managing security through regional security pacts.

Iran signed an interim agreement over its nuclear plan with world powers last month. Rouhani has been trying to convince skeptics and hard-liners at home that the move was not compromising on key issues of national sovereignty.

Israel has repeatedly criticized the deal and called it a ""historic mistake,"" saying economic sanctions must be toughened, not eased.

Kerry kicked off his Asian tour Friday

Threats of missile tests from North Korea loom



His trip coincides with disclosure of a new U.S. intelligence report

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in South Korea on Friday on an unusual diplomatic journey, traveling directly into a region bracing for a possible North Korean missile test and risking that his presence alone could spur Pyongyang into another headline-seeking provocation.

In a news conference in Seoul, Kerry said North Korea would not be accepted as a nuclear power and that the current rhetoric from the nation is ""unacceptable.""

""The U.S. will defend its allies if necessary,"" Kerry said. He said that the U.S. was prepared to engage in talks with North Korea but only if the nation was serious about denuclearization.

Kerry was kicking off four days of talks in East Asia amid speculation that the North's unpredictable regime would launch a mid-range missile designed to reach as far as the U.S. territory of Guam. Kerry also planned to visit China and Japan.

Kerry said that China has the ability to make an enormous difference to the situation by applying pressure to Pyongyang.

North Korea often times its provocations to generate maximum attention, and Kerry's presence in Seoul will provide plenty of that, even if the United States is engaged in intense diplomacy with China, the North's benefactor, in an effort to lower tensions. Another dangerous date on the calendar is April 15, the 101st birthday of North Korea's deceased founder, Kim Il Sung.

Kerry's trip coincides with the disclosure of a new U.S. intelligence report that concludes North Korea has advanced its nuclear knowhow to the point that it could arm a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead. The analysis, disclosed Thursday at a congressional hearing in Washington, said the Pentagon's intelligence wing has ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles but that the weapon would be unreliable.

Pentagon spokesman George Little said afterward that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced"" at the congressional hearing.

James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said he concurred with Little and noted that the report alluded to at the hearing was compiled by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency and was not an assessment by the entire U.S. intelligence community. ""Moreover, North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile,"" he said.

President Barack Obama on Thursday urged calm, calling on Pyongyang to end its saber-rattling while sternly warning that he would ""take all necessary steps"" to protect American citizens.

Kerry's trip marks his first foray to the Asia-Pacific as America's top diplomat, spearheading the effort to ""pivot"" U.S. power away from Europe and the Middle East and toward the world's most populous region and fulcrum of economic growth.

And it comes on the heels of months of provocative action and warlike rhetoric from Pyongyang, including talk of nuclear strikes against the United States — however outlandish analysts consider such threats. No one is discounting the danger entirely after tests of a nuclear device and ballistic missile technology in recent months.

Kerry's trip was planned well in advance of the latest danger to destabilize the Korean peninsula: North Korea's apparent preparations for another missile test in defiance of United Nations resolutions. The crisis clearly has overtaken the rest of his Asian agenda.

The Obama administration believes North Korea is preparing for another missile test, said a senior State Department official traveling with Kerry on the plane to Seoul. ""We will show to our allies that we are prepared and we will defend them,"" the official said.

To mitigate the threat, however, Kerry is largely depending on China to take a bigger role in pressuring North Korea to live up to previous agreements to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It's a strategy that has worked poorly for the U.S. for more than two decades.

Beijing has the most leverage with Pyongyang. It has massively boosted trade with its communist neighbor and maintains close military ties. And the U.S. believes the Chinese could take several specific steps to show North Korea it cannot threaten regional stability with impunity.

These include getting China to cut off support for North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, said the State Department official and another senior administration official, though they rejected that the U.S. was seeking a commercial embargo against the North.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about Kerry's meetings in advance.

Neither could say, however, whether Pyongyang under its enigmatic young leader, Kim Jong Un, was actually listening at this point. One of them stressed that he ""wouldn't say there is no conversation between them,"" but declined to describe the level and impact of Chinese-North Korean contacts.

Kim's actual control of the country also is unclear, the official added. Now 29 or 30, the basketball devotee and product of a Swiss boarding school inherited power from his late father, Kim Jong Il, some 16 months ago and has seemed to lead his country on an increasingly reckless path toward possible confrontation.

That has led many observers and policymakers abroad to devote increasing time toward analyzing what little information they have on Kim to figure out how he can be mollified without being rewarded.

In a telephone call to President Obama on Wednesday evening, the chancellor noted that a visit to Washington by senior officials from the German government and its intelligence services offered the chance for an “intensive discussion” of concerns over the scope of American intelligence activities, data protection and privacy, the statement said.

But French officials, speaking to reporters, made it clear that they would still favor delaying trade talks if there was no movement from the Americans on the espionage by next week.

And now, the uproar has encompassed Latin America as well.

“In some sense, it parallels ironically what the N.S.A. is doing,” said Faiza Patel, a co-director of the liberty and national security program of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a research and advocacy organization. “The N.S.A. is reaching its tentacles aross the world.”

Mr. Snowden and his disclosures have touched different chords in each region. In Europe, Ms. Patel noted, they have provoked memories of the police states created by fascism and communism, with their heavy-handed surveillance of their own people. In Latin America, she said, they have touched on a wellspring of resentment over the legacy of colonialism and American power, as well as the region’s own history of secretive dictatorships.

The latest burst of outrage came in response to the diversion of a plane carrying Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, as he was flying home from Moscow on Tuesday. He had attended a meeting of nations that export natural gas and had told Russian television that he was open to giving asylum to Mr. Snowden."

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who has acknowledged leaking numerous documents about American surveillance operations around the world, planned his escape from Hong Kong over a surreptitious dinner of pizza, fried chicken and sausages, washed down with Pepsi.

It was a cloak-and-dagger affair. Mr. Snowden wore a cap and sunglasses and insisted that the assembled lawyers hide their cellphones in the refrigerator of the home where he was staying, to block any eavesdropping. Then began a two-hour conversation during which Mr. Snowden was deeply dismayed to learn that he could spend years in prison without access to a computer during litigation over whether he would be granted asylum here or surrendered to the United States.

Staying cooped up in the cramped Hong Kong home of a local supporter was less bothersome to Mr. Snowden than the prospect of losing his computer.

“He didn’t go out, he spent all his time inside a tiny space, but he said it was O.K. because he had his computer,” said Albert Ho, one of Mr. Snowden’s lawyers. “If you were to deprive him of his computer, that would be totally intolerable.”"

Danny Danon, Israel's deputy defense minister told USA Today that Iran is speedily moving to develop advanced centrifuges that will enable it to enrich uranium needed for nuclear weapons within weeks.

""We have made it crystal clear – in all possible forums, that Israel will not stand by and watch Iran develop weaponry that will put us, the entire Middle East and eventually the world, under an Iranian umbrella of terror,"" Danny Danon, Israel's deputy defense minister told USA Today.

The United States and other world powers fear Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. The Islamic republic says its program is for peaceful energy production, and this week's meetings in part focused on how to scale back its enrichment of material that can be used to generate power or nuclear warhead material.

The Institute for Science and International Security on Thursday issued a report stating that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb in as little as one month, USA Today reported. The organization's estimates did not include the time required to build a reliable warhead for a ballistic missile

Meanwhile, the Obama administration is asking Congress to hold off on enacting new sanctions against Iran, arguing that a pause in the push to impose new penalties would give negotiators flexibility in talks now underway to get Iran to comply with demands it prove its nuclear program is peaceful.

Even as U.S. officials argue that tough sanctions are what brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, the White House and State Department said Friday the administration wants lawmakers to wait on new sanctions legislation to give the negotiations time to get traction. Some lawmakers have argued that now is not the time to ease pressure and that pursuing new sanctions will give the U.S. additional leverage in the talks.

But, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it was the consensus of the administration's national security teams that a pause ""would be helpful in terms of providing some flexibility while we see if these negotiations will move forward."" She said the position was delivered to lawmakers and congressional aides at a White House meeting on Thursday.

""We have conveyed that any congressional action should be aligned with our negotiating strategy as we move forward. So while we understand that Congress may consider new sanctions, we think this is a time for a pause, as we asked for in the past, to see if negotiations can gain traction,"" Psaki told reporters.

She noted that additional sanctions can always be imposed later if the Iranians fail to meet their obligations, and she stressed that no existing sanctions are being lifted.

At the White House, national security council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the negotiations would not last indefinitely without progress and movement from Iran, which has long defied international demands to come clean about its nuclear intentions.

""The window for negotiation is not open-ended, and if progress isn't made, there may be a time when more sanctions are, in fact, necessary,"" Hayden said. ""We have always said that there would be no agreement overnight, and we've been clear that this process is going to take some time.""

Bipartisan pressure in Congress to ramp up sanctions on Iran has been rising for some time and hit a new high last week after negotiators from the United States, the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany met with Iranian officials in Geneva.

The chief U.S. negotiator, Wendy Sherman, told Congress before those talks that the administration would support tougher sanctions on Iran if it didn't come to the Geneva talks with ""concrete, substantive actions"" and a verifiable plan to scale back its nuclear program.

The Senate Banking Committee is expected soon to draft new sanctions shortly after the government reopens, largely mirroring a House bill that passed overwhelmingly by a 400-20 vote in July and blacklisted Iran's mining and construction sectors. It also called for all Iranian oil sales to end by 2015.

The Senate's bill may narrow that timeframe, block international investment in more economic sectors, try to close off Iran's foreign accounts and tighten Obama's ability to waive requirements for allies and key trading partners who continue to do business with Iran.

Israel PM calls emerging nuclear deal %27bad%27

Secretary of State Kerry in Geneva for talks

Israel has vowed to not let Iran get nuclear weapons

The name of a White House spokesman was stated incorrectly in an earlier version of this article. He is Josh Earnest.

Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Geneva on Friday to try to ""narrow the differences"" with Iran on an interim agreement over its nuclear program, a proposal Israel says would be a ""very bad deal"" that allows Iran to keep heading toward a possible atomic bomb.

There has been no confirmation that a deal is close or details of possible elements of such a pact, but foreign ministers from China and Russia were traveling to Geneva to join their counterparts from the USA, United Kingdom, France and Germany, according to Bloomberg. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke as if he knew what kind of offer was being discussed.

Speaking before a meeting with Kerry in Jerusalem on Friday, Netanyahu said it appears that the Iranians ""got everything and paid nothing.""

""They wanted relief of sanctions after years of grueling sanctions, they got that. They paid nothing because they are not reducing in any way their nuclear enrichment capability. So Iran got the deal of the century and the international community got a bad deal,"" Netanyahu said.

Netanyahu said that since Israel is not obligated by the agreement it reserves the right to do what it feels is necessary to defend itself, an apparent reference to a possible military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities.

President Obama called the Israeli leader Friday and ""underscored his strong commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,"" according to a White House statement. Josh Earnest, a deputy press secretary for the White House, told reporters ""there is no deal,"" and that ""any critique of the deal is premature.""

Some administration allies on Capitol Hill have already expressed concern the deal won't go far enough.

""While I support the President's efforts to engage with Iran, I am deeply troubled by reports that such an agreement may not require Tehran to halt its enrichment efforts,"" said Rep. Richard Engel, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""If Iran intends to show good faith during these talks, it must at a minimum abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for a halt to enrichment — and it is my hope that we achieve much more.""

Israel and the USA suspect the facilities are being used to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful means.

Israel says the United States should seek nothing less than a total shutdown of uranium enrichment and other nuclear programs in Iran in return for the easing of economic sanctions.

Kerry said when he arrived Friday in Geneva at the invitation of European Union representative Catherine Ashton, that there are still ""some important gaps that have to be closed"" with Iran if an agreement is to be reached. Netanyahu said he reminded Kerry of Iran's true nature, a foe of America and supporter of Islamic terror attacks worldwide.

Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for President Obama's National Security Council, said Friday the so-called ""first step"" offer, ""would address Iran's most advanced nuclear activities, increase transparency so Iran will not be able to use the cover of talks to advance its program, and create time and space as we negotiate a comprehensive agreement.""

If Iran does not live up to its commitments, ""the temporary, modest relief would be terminated, and we would be in a position to ratchet up the pressure even further by adding new sanctions,"" Meehan said.

Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, says the parts of the offer he was briefed on by the White House undercut sanctions meant to block Iran from acquiring equipment it could use to develop its nuclear program or for weapons, and to convince Iran to negotiate a solution with world powers. The plan would give Iran a cash infusion from frozen accounts it can use to expand nuclear facilities or to fund terrorism, Dubowitz said.

""It totally eviscerates the sanctions regime if you allow Iran to spend money at its discretion to fund the very nuclear program it's funding, the very nuclear program you're trying to stop, or to fund terrorist activities against American citizens,"" said Dubowitz, who had proposed a different plan to allow Iran to buy non-sanctioned goods in Europe while negotiations continue.

Iran has $80 billion in foreign accounts, with unrestricted access to only $20 billion, Dubowitz said. He said he was not told the amounts under consideration in the plan.

""They told me, don't worry, it's reversible. If they cheat it won't happen again. But that's not reversible, unless you only give them 1% up front and more later.""

Israel considers a nuclear-armed Iran to be an existential threat, citing hostile Iranian rhetoric toward the Jewish state, Iran's missile capabilities and its support for violent Middle Eastern militant groups.

Netanyahu says pressure must be maintained until Iran halts all enrichment of uranium, a key step in producing a nuclear weapon; removes its stockpile of enriched uranium from the country; closes suspicious enrichment facilities and shutters a facility that could produce plutonium, another potential gateway to nuclear arms.

In More Than Three Decades At The Paper', 'She Has Served As Bureau Chief In Latin America', 'In London']","Alan Gross, former USAID contractor jailed in Cuba, appeals to Obama to intervene","On the fourth anniversary of his imprisonment in Cuba, former U.S. government contractor Alan Gross said he fears his country has “abandoned” him and appealed to President Obama to personally intervene in his case.

In a letter to the president, sent via the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana, Gross describes his isolation from the world, adding that his daughter and mother have been stricken by cancer, his wife has had to sell the family home in Maryland, and “my business and career have been destroyed.”

Indirectly critical of what his family views as lackluster efforts to secure his release, Gross notes that this administration and its predecessors “have taken extraordinary steps to obtain the release of other U.S. citizens imprisoned abroad.” But unlike in those cases, Obama has sent no special emissaries nor agreed to negotiate over him.

The letter, a copy of which was provided to The Washington Post, is to be delivered to the White House on Tuesday — the anniversary of Gross’s 2009 arrest in Havana. It is part of a new strategy by his family to direct pressure at Obama, including in a demonstration Tuesday outside the White House led by his Gross’s wife, Judy.

Gross’s disenchantment with the administration over his treatment is shared by a growing number of U.S. lawmakers, who see him as one of the last victims of the Cold War and the decades-long freeze in U.S.-Cuba relations that has persisted despite Obama’s early pledges to work toward a thaw.

In a letter to the president last month, a bipartisan group of 66 senators, spearheaded by Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), called Gross’s case “a matter of grave urgency” and urged Obama to “act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain his release.” The senators told Obama that they “stand ready to support your administration in pursuit of this worthy goal.”

A week earlier, a separate group of 14 lawmakers, led by Cuban American Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), exhorted Obama to continue his policy of demanding Gross’s “immediate and unconditional release.”

In a statement Monday, Leahy countered that “instead of simply demanding Mr. Gross’ unconditional release — which has achieved nothing in four years, and which his family regards as a death sentence — they should not shrink from the obligation to negotiate for his freedom.”

Gross, a 64-year-old Maryland native, was detained while distributing communications equipment to Jewish groups in Cuba under a contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was convicted in 2011 of crimes against the Cuban state and sentenced to 15 years.

His continued imprisonment comes as the administration has eased restrictions on American travel to Cuba and held direct negotiations over a range of issues, including immigration, postal services and cooperation on possible oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida.

Although critical of the Cuban government’s restrictions on civil rights and personal freedom, Obama has indicated that he has little enthusiasm for the trade embargo and economic sanctions imposed on Cuba more than a half-

century ago.

“The notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel doesn’t make sense,” he said at a Miami fundraiser last month. “We have to find new mechanisms and new tools.”

But Cuban American lawmakers have consistently opposed negotiating with the island’s communist government. Although public opinion in that community has begun to shift away from a hard line on Cuba, any high-level talks remain politically dicey for Obama.

Progress on the Gross case also has been stymied by Havana’s demands for the release of five Cubans arrested in Florida in 1998 and given lengthy prison sentences after being found guilty of acting as Cuban agents. Havana has acknowledged that the five were spying on Cuban exile organizations and U.S. military installations but said the surveillance was part of an attempt to prevent what had been a series of exile-

organized attacks on the island.

One of the five was paroled in 2011 and returned to Cuba. A second is eligible for parole in February. Being a Cuban national, the “greatest likelihood is that he would be deported almost immediately,” said a U.S. official who was familiar with the case.

The official, who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there is some hope within the administration that the anticipated release could bring progress on the Gross front.

Gross’s attorney, Scott Gilbert, said in an interview that the Cubans “have made very clear to the United States, and to us directly to pass on, that they’re willing to sit down and meet with no preconditions to discuss Alan’s release.”

Roberta Jacobson, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said, “Some very senior people in this administration have put their minds and attention on trying to get Alan Gross out of prison, as well as some senior members of Congress. In the end, it is up to the Cubans, and they have not been responsive.”

“We continue to urge the Cuban government to release him immediately,” she said.

In his letter to Obama, Gross wrote: “I find myself asking the same question — why? Why am I still here? With the utmost respect, Mr. President, I fear that my government — the very government I was serving when I began this nightmare — has abandoned me.”

A November lawsuit filed by Gross and his wife in federal court was dismissed this year. They sought to hold USAID and his employer, Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc., “accountable for their role in Mr. Gross’ detention and imprisonment, including their abject failure to advise, train and protect him.”

At the time of his arrest, Gross was on his fifth trip to Cuba, where he had been subcontracted to secretly distribute Internet equipment to the island’s small Jewish community under a U.S. democracy-­building program.

The American embassy in Baghdad was a likely target, according to unnamed U.S. officials quoted by the newspaper. The Journal said the officials did not describe the range of potential targets indicated by the intelligence.

In addition, the State Department issued a warning on Thursday telling U.S. citizens to avoid all but ""essential"" travel to Iraq.

President Barack Obama has asked the U.S. Congress to back his plan for limited strikes in response to a chemical weapons attack on civilians that the United States blames on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

The Journal reported that the Iranian message was intercepted in recent days and came from the head of the Revolutionary Guards' Qods Force. The newspaper said the message went to Iranian-supported Shi'ite militia groups in Iraq.

The Journal reported that the message informed Shi'ite groups to be prepared to respond with force after any U.S. military strike on Syria.

""Travel within Iraq remains dangerous given the security situation,"" according to the State Department's warning, which replaced an earlier one ""to update information on security incidents and to remind U.S. citizens of ongoing security concerns in Iraq, including kidnapping and terrorist violence.""

The department said that numerous insurgent groups, including al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate, remain active and ""terrorist activity and sectarian violence persist in many areas of the country at levels unseen since 2008.""

It added: ""The ability of the embassy to respond to situations in which U.S. citizens face difficulty, including arrests, is extremely limited.""

The State Department declined immediate comment. The CIA declined comment.

In a hurriedly arranged telephone call, Mr. Obama reached Mr. Rouhani as the Iranian leader was headed to the airport to leave New York after a whirlwind news media and diplomatic blitz. The two agreed to accelerate talks aimed at defusing the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program and afterward expressed optimism at the prospect of a rapprochement that would transform the Middle East.

“Resolving this issue, obviously, could also serve as a major step forward in a new relationship between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran, one based on mutual interests and mutual respect,” Mr. Obama, referring to Tehran’s nuclear program, told reporters at the White House after the 15-minute phone call. “It would also help facilitate a better relationship between Iran and the international community, as well as others in the region.”

A Twitter account in Mr. Rouhani’s name later stated, “In regards to nuclear issue, with political will, there is a way to rapidly solve the matter.” The account added that Mr. Rouhani had told Mr. Obama, “We’re hopeful about what we will see from” the United States and other major powers “in coming weeks and months.”"

Chemical weapons experts say send gas masks, not bombs

White House: A ""clear violation"" of global standards needs a response

Strikes are ""more about Washington saving face,"" historian says

The United States and its allies face a variety of risks in taking direct military action against Syria over allegations that it used chemical weapons against civilians, including more poison gas attacks and retaliation against American interests.

Those warnings come from experts in chemical weapons and veteran Middle East analysts, some of whom say Washington faces no good choices in confronting embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

Missile strikes on Syrian military command bunkers, airfields or the artillery batteries and rocket launchers used to fire chemical projectiles are among the options U.S. officials say are under consideration. But there is no indication that the missiles would target stockpiles of chemical weapons -- something Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the British military's chemical defense regiment, called ""the worst possible option.""

""If the missile and the explosive are big enough, they will, of course, destroy it,"" de Bretton-Gordon said. ""However, there will be a downwind hazard, and those people in the vicinity -- and it's very difficult to say how far, but certainly a kilometer or so -- are likely going to suffer and become casualties from the fallout of those exploding chemical weapons.""

And any attack on Syria might encourage al-Assad to order more chemical attacks on rebel forces and civilians in opposition-held areas, said Amy Smithson, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Washington.

""Not doing anything tells Assad he's not going to get punished, go out and use the chemicals,"" said Smithson, who has studied chemical and biological weapons for two decades. ""Striking the chemical sites presents a very real risk of releasing toxic chemicals over nearby civilian populations. Not striking the chemical sites leaves Assad with potent weapons in his hands that he's shown he's willing to use.""

Striking other military targets leaves ""a very ticked-off despot that is now perhaps even more tempted to use his chemical arsenal,"" she said. ""He's already been punished for it."" That might convince al-Assad to go out ""in a blaze of glory -- or in this case, infamy.""

Juan Cole, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Michigan, said the kind of intervention being discussed isn't likely to affect the balance of power in the 2-year-old Syrian conflict beyond providing a psychological boost to the rebels, who have suffered battlefield setbacks over the summer.

""This is more about Washington saving face, it seems to me, than it is a consequential intervention in the Syrian conflict,"" Cole said, adding, ""When you're in a position where it is assumed that the United States must do something, a couple of Tomahawks make a statement.""

The war ""is being fought in alleyways and at close quarters, with artillery and tanks inside cities,"" he said. Missile strikes from distant warships or aircraft wouldn't be able to knock out enough of those weapons to make a difference without inflicting extensive civilian losses, he said.

Syria has admitted to possessing chemical weapons but has denied using them, saying its troops were the victims of rebel attacks. U.N. inspectors are now in Syria to investigate whether the reported deaths of hundreds of people outside Damascus a week ago was the result of a chemical attack. But U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday there was ""no doubt"" government troops used chemical weapons on civilians.

The United States has already demanded that al-Assad cede power and is supporting Syria's opposition, but the possible American strikes are not about removing him, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.

""They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons,"" Carney said.

Syria's civil war is already spilling over the borders of its neighbors in the form of bombings and refugees and is widely seen as a proxy war among different regional powers . Cole said al-Assad's government might try to strike back by targeting American military, diplomatic or commercial interests in the Middle East, perhaps employing its allies in the Lebanese militia Hezbollah -- which has a long and bloody track record targeting Americans during Lebanon's long civil war.

""If Washington bombs things in Syria, I wouldn't want to be an American in Beirut within reaching distance of Hezbollah,"" he said. ""You could see a return to 1980s types of things happening, when our embassy was blown up in Beirut and our CIA station chief was kidnapped and killed in the woods.""

Both de Bretton-Gordon and Smithson said a better course of action might be to start supplying Syrians with the means to defend themselves against chemical attack. That means distributing masks, detectors and drugs used to treat patients exposed to nerve gas and training Syrians how to use them.

Smithson said those supplies and training could be provided by numerous countries, whose militaries are trained in chemical defense, and rushed into the field by aid agencies and opposition groups, possibly via neighboring Turkey. It could be done ""very quickly and very publicly,"" and with broader support from the international community than American airstrikes, she said.

""If the civilian population can be equipped to contend with this, just as they have adjusted their lifestyles to adapt to urban warfare around them, then perhaps that takes away some of the advantage,"" she said. ""If your chemical attack doesn't have an effect, then why use the weapons?"""

http://news.yahoo.com/rising-power-india-sees-no-u-style-gulf-221410254.html,,[],Rising power India sees no U.S.-style Gulf security role,"By William Maclean MANAMA (Reuters) - Rising naval power India has no intention of becoming a U.S.-style protector of Gulf Arab states, even if the region's states asked it to take on that role, its foreign minister said on Saturday, citing his country's avoidance of foreign military deployments not mandated by the United Nations. Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid added without elaborating that any effort by fellow Asian powers Japan and China to become a strategic security partner of the Gulf would not necessarily help secure the region, where deployed U.S. forces are currently the dominant military power. Khurshid was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a security conference in Bahrain that debated whether a United States increasingly self reliant in oil might show less commitment to safeguarding the Strait of Hormuz, the world's main energy artery through which 40 percent of the world's sea-borne oil exports pass. ""We have never played the classical role of intervening with military assistance in the same way that the U.S. has been doing,"" he said. ""Because of the philosophical constraints that we impose on ourselves, we don't see ourselves as a replacement for any other power. We certainly don't believe that the presence of any other power, such as China or Japan, or what have you, would necessarily contribute to the security of the region."" Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel told the meeting on Saturday that the United States has a proven and enduring commitment to Middle East security, backed by diplomatic engagement as well as warplanes, ships, tanks, artillery and 35,000 troop. Nonetheless, unfamiliar strains have appeared in the relationship between the wealthy states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the United States, partly because a decline in Washington's energy imports from the region has stirred speculation it may reduce its military footprint in the region. Another reason for strain is progress in negotiations on Iran's dispute nuclear programme, a development that raises the possibility of a rapprochement between the United States and Iran, a country some GCC states view as a troublemaker, after more than 30 years of hostility. That has led some Gulf Arab analysts and officials to speculate that the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are casting around for new security partners, possibly the rising military powers of Asia that have long been the main buyers of oil from the Gulf states. Khurshid told Reuters India would not play this role, although it would always be ready to help train, exercise and share intelligence with Gulf Arab forces. Doing military exercises was one thing, he said. ""Stationing yourself for purposes of strategic defence is another matter entirely,"" he said. ""India has very, very carefully and strictly adhered to certain principles and we would want to continue to adhere to those principles. We have never join alliances and we have never joined military groups."" India is on a push to modernise its mostly Soviet-era military, and plans to spend $100 billion in the next 10 years doing that. And like most Asian powers, India is building its naval forces just as Western navies cut back. NO BOOTS ON THE GROUND India launched its first domestically-built aircraft carrier this year, but it will not be fully operational until 2017. In November, Russia handed over a $2.3 billion aircraft carrier to India after years of delays, extending the South Asian country's maritime reach in the Indian Ocean as it looks to counter China's assertive presence in the region. India's first, British-built, aircraft carrier was bought in the 1960s and was decommissioned in 1997. Another ex-British carrier, the INS Viraat, is in operation but is reaching the end of its service. India's is also one of several navies that keep watch against Somali pirates in gthe Indian Ocean: others include China, Russia, Japan and South Korea. India seeks to expand its influence in the Gulf, where it has old ties of trade and where millions of its nationals are migrant workers, and relies on the Middle East for more than half of its oil imports. But Khurshid suggested that direct military support would be a step too far. Asked if India would respond if Gulf Arab states asked it to play the role of a security guarantor, he said: ""Even that would be a paradigm shift"" A UN request and a Gulf Arab request would be ""a different thing."" ""We would want to help them in logistics, including cooperation on counter- terrorism, on protection of sea lanes, on intelligence sharing, on capaciict building. These are areas where we are very happy to work with our partner friends."" ""But will India be willing to step into a possible vacuum, if there might be the withdrawal of existing forces … I think that is not the kind of thing that we - in terms of present strategic planning and understanding, that we would (contemplate)."" ""Boots on the ground is not something India has done except very specifically and enthusiastically through the UN. Whenever the UN has sought help and personnel we have provided it.

Sanger', 'Jodi Rudoren']",Split on Accord on Iran Strains U.S.-Israel Ties,"While the Americans say it “freezes” the Iranian program and rolls it back, the fact is that only some elements are frozen, and the rollbacks in the initial agreement are relatively minor. For example, Iran would continue adding to its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, meaning uranium enriched to reactor grade, or less than 5 percent purity. But the United States maintains that under details of the agreement it cannot yet disclose, the overall size of Iran’s stockpile would not increase.

The reason appears to be that Iran would agree to convert some of its medium-enriched uranium — fuel enriched to 20 percent purity, or near bomb grade — into an oxide form that is on the way to becoming reactor fuel. But that process can be easily reversed, notes Olli Heinonen, the former chief inspector of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Mr. Netanyahu’s camp and some Israeli analysts say the Israeli leader’s unstinting opposition is both substantive and political. He truly believes that a deal lifting sanctions without fully halting enrichment and dismantling centrifuges is a terrible mistake. But he has also staked his premiership on fighting the Iranian nuclear threat, and the change in approach by his closest allies leaves him a bit rudderless.

“The situation has changed and everybody else except Israel understands that a deal means to be more flexible,” said Giora Eiland, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “Netanyahu speaks only about a good deal. The Americans are speaking about a reasonable deal, which is better than having no deal at all.”

For his part, Mr. Kerry has questioned publicly whether Mr. Netanyahu is aware of all the details in the agreement. And in some cases, Israeli officials appear to have distorted what Iran would get in return.

At a briefing with international journalists on Wednesday, Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, said the deal would directly erase $15 billion to $20 billion of what he estimated was the $100 billion the current sanctions are costing Iran annually, and lead to relief of up to $40 billion because of indirect effects. The State Department immediately debunked those numbers, noting the sanctions relief would be for only six months, not a year. And the Americans put the figure at under $10 billion. But Israeli leaders have continued to cite the higher estimates.

There are also different accounts of what would happen to a heavy-water nuclear reactor now under construction near the town of Arak. The facility is critical to Iran’s plans because, if operating, it could provide it with a steady supply of plutonium, the fuel North Korea and now Pakistan have used for their arsenals.

France stepped into the negotiations 10 days ago complaining that the draft accord would allow Iran to get too close to being able to insert fuel into that reactor — at which point it could not be bombed by Israel without risking a radioactive, environmental disaster. The proposed agreement has since been modified, American officials say, to make sure that Iran is months to a year from being able to put fuel in the reactor."

But unofficially, it is only too happy to dump on the United States.

After days of silence, state media have let loose with a barrage of criticism concerning Snowden’s allegations of a massive electronic surveillance program by the United States. The English-language China Daily ran a large cartoon of a shadowed Statue of Liberty, holding a tape recorder and microphone instead of a tablet and torch.

In an editorial dripping with indignation, the Communist Party-run Global Times demanded an explanation on behalf of the Chinese government.

“Before Snowden is silenced, Washington owes China an explanation of whether the U.S. as an Internet superpower abused its power over our vital interests,’’ Global Times opined.

In Hong Kong, the pro-Communist Party Takungpao newspaper added: “If the U.S. is the true defender of democracy, human rights and freedom like it always described itself ... President Obama should sincerely apologize to the people from other countries whose privacy was violated.’’

Of course, the criticism is irresistible, the opportunity too rich to pass up. For months now, the U.S. government has demanded that the Chinese government rein in an extensive military-sponsored hacking operation. During last weekend’s summit between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, cybersecurity was the main item on the U.S. agenda.

Snowden, the 29-year-old former U.S. government contractor who says he leaked National Security Agency secrets and is now in hiding in Hong Kong, alleged in an interview published early Thursday in the South China Morning Post that there had been more than 61,000 NSA hacking operations internationally, hundreds of them directed against China and Hong Kong.

“We hack network backbones -- like huge Internet routers, basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,” Snowden told the Hong Kong-based newspaper.

He said he wanted to demonstrate “the hypocrisy of the U.S. government when it claims that it does not target civilian infrastructure, unlike its adversaries.”

Snowden’s presence in Hong Kong presents the Chinese Communist Party with an opportunity and a headache. He entered Hong Kong on May 20 on a 90-day tourist visa and will need to be dealt with once the visa expires.

Although the former British colony is self-ruled, Beijing has the final say in matters of national security and foreign affairs. Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the United States, but any decision on Snowden’s case must be approved by the Chinese central government.

For days now, the Chinese government has maintained a stony silence. The allegations of the U.S. surveillance program have been splashed across front pages around the world since last week, but only surfaced in the Chinese media Thursday, at the end of a three-day Chinese holiday.

“I have no information to offer,’’ a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, responded repeatedly with a thin-lipped smile in response to a barrage of questions by reporters at a briefing in Beijing on Thursday.

Advertisement

Pressed by reporters, she repeated what has been the stock phrase by the Chinese government for months now, saying that “China is one of the most affected victims of hacking and wishes to have an international dialogue on the subject based on maintaining peace, security, openness and cooperation.’’

Many foreign-policy commentators believe that Beijing will have a hard time exploiting the Snowden revelations to its own benefit, given its vulnerability to charges of human rights abuse and invasion of privacy.

“The fact cannot be changed that China is abusing the Internet to violate human rights and serve its one-party system,’’ editorialized another Hong Kong-based newspaper, Apple Daily.

Chinese dissidents say they fear that the scandal will weaken the United States’ ability to take the high ground in pushing for more freedoms from Beijing. They say the Chinese government is merely using the Snowden case to cover its own culpability in hacking, eavesdropping and electronic surveillance.

“It is unfair to compare what the U.S. does to China,’’ said Chen Ziming, a veteran of the 1989 pro-democracy movement centered around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. “The U.S. program is trying to prevent certain terrorist activities, while China is listening in to monitor what dissidents are saying and writing. People get thrown into jail here just for an email.’’

However, one of China’s most prominent dissidents, artist Ai Weiwei, wrote of his disappointment in an editorial titled “The U.S. Is Behaving Like China.”

“This abuse of state power goes totally against my understanding of what it means to be a civilized society, and it will be shocking for me if American citizens allow this to continue,’’ he wrote in the Guardian earlier this week.

Security Council voted unanimously Thursday for tough new sanctions to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test, and a furious Pyongyang threatened a nuclear strike against the United States.

The sanctions drafted by North Korea's closest ally, China, and the United States send a powerful message that the international community condemns Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear tests -- and repeated violations of Security Council resolutions.

""Adoption of the resolution itself is not enough,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Li Baodong said. ""We want to see full implementation of the resolution."" Li also urged calm and a resumption of the stalled six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.

""The top priority now is to defuse the tensions, bring down heat ... bring the situation back on the track of diplomacy, on negotiations,"" Li said.

Immediately before the vote, an unidentified spokesman for Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said the North will exercise its right for ""a preemptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors"" because Washington is ""set to light a fuse for a nuclear war.""

The statement was carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, which issued no immediate comment after the Security Council vote.

In Pyongyang, Army Gen. Kang Pyo Yong told a crowd of tens of thousands that North Korea is ready to fire long-range nuclear-armed missiles at Washington, which ""will be engulfed in a sea of fire.""

The White House responded by saying the U.S. is fully capable of defending itself against a North Korea ballistic missile attack.

Although North Korea boasts of nuclear bombs and pre-emptive strikes, it is not thought to have mastered the ability to produce a warhead small enough to put on a missile capable of reaching the U.S. It is believed to have enough nuclear fuel, however, for several crude nuclear devices.

The United States has long been concerned that North Korea could eventually pose a missile threat to U.S. territory. The Defense Department first began to operate a ground-based missile defense system in late 2004 with such a potential threat in mind.

""Taken together, these sanctions will bite, and bite hard,"" U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said after the vote.

""North Korea must wake up from its delusion of becoming a ... nuclear weapons state and make the right choice,"" said South Korea's U.N. Ambassador Kim Sook said. ""It can either take the right path toward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual self-destruction.""

Tensions have escalated following a rocket launch by Pyongyang in December and its third nuclear test on Feb. 12. Both acts defied three Security Council resolutions that bar North Korea from testing or using nuclear or ballistic missile technology and from importing or exporting material for these programs.

The new sanctions resolution is the fourth against North Korea since its first nuclear test in 2006.

It condemns the latest nuclear test ""in the strongest terms"" for violating and flagrantly disregarding council resolutions. It bans further ballistic missile launches, nuclear tests ""or any other provocation"" and demands that North Korea return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It condemns all of North Korea's ongoing nuclear activities, including its uranium enrichment.

But the resolution also stresses the council's commitment ""to a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution"" to North Korea's nuclear program and urges a resumption of six-party talks.

The success of new sanctions could depend on enforcement by China, where most of the companies and banks that North Korea is believed to work with are based.

The resolution strengthens inspections of suspicious cargo heading to and from the country and calls on states to step up ""vigilance"" of possible illegal activity by North Korean diplomats. In a measure targeted at the reclusive nation's ruling elite, the resolution bans all nations from exporting expensive jewelry, yachts, luxury automobiles and racing cars to the North.

All countries would now be required to freeze financial transactions or services that could contribute to North Korea's nuclear or missile programs.

The resolution identifies three individuals, one corporation and one organization that will be added to the U.N. sanctions list. The targets include top officials at a company that is the country's primary arms dealer and main exporter of ballistic missile-related equipment, and a national organization responsible for research and development of missiles and probably nuclear weapons.

To get around financial sanctions, North Koreans have been carrying around large suitcases filled with cash to move illicit funds. The resolution expresses concern that these bulk cash transfers may be used to evade sanctions.

The resolution also bans all countries from providing public financial support for trade deals, such as granting export credits, guarantees or insurance, if the assistance could contribute to the North's nuclear or missile programs.

It includes what a senior diplomat called unprecedented new travel sanctions that would require countries to expel agents working for sanctioned North Korean companies.

The resolution also requires states to inspect suspect cargo on their territory and prevent any vessel that refuses an inspection from entering their ports. And a new aviation measure calls on states to deny aircraft permission to take off, land or fly over their territory if illicit cargo is suspected to be aboard."

USA TODAY

SANAA, Yemen — U.S. aircraft buzzed over the capital of Yemen on Tuesday after the State Department ordered all non-essential personnel out of the embassy and urged all Americans to leave due to to ""the continued potential for terrorist attacks.""

State has advised non-government U.S. citizens to stay away from Yemen since the country's political unrest erupted in 2011 but the warning was upgraded to urge all Americans to leave immediately because of an ""extremely high"" security threat level.

The U.S. Air Force transported State Department personnel out of Sanaa early Tuesday. Military personnel remain ""on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation,"" Pentagon press secretary George Little said.

A senior defense official told the Associated Press that 50 to 100 diplomatic personnel were flown out of Sanaa in a C-17 military transport at dawn Tuesday and were taken to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The official was not authorized to discuss the information publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.

U.S. surveillance planes circled the skies of the capital on Tuesday morning.

""As staff levels at the Embassy are restricted, our ability to assist U.S. citizens in an emergency and provide routine consular services remains limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation,"" the State Department travel warning said.

The British government also ordered its embassy evacuated ""temporarily"" and had its shipping in the region along the Red Sea on the highest possible alert.

The Yemen Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had taken ""all necessary precautions"" to ensure the safety of foreign missions in Sana'a and suggested the embassy closures would hurt efforts to defeat terrorists.

""While the government of Yemen appreciates foreign governments' concern for the safety of their citizens, the evacuation of embassy staff serves the interests of the extremists and undermines the exceptional cooperation between Yemen and the international alliance against terrorism,"" the ministry said in a statement.

The shutdown of embassies was instigated by an intercepted secret message between al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri and Nasser al-Wahishi, the leader of the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, about plans for a major terror attack,according to The Associated Press. The officials who gave the information o the AP spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The U.S. has pummeled terror leaders in Yemen with targeted drone strikes for at least two years. On Tuesday, Yemeni security officials said a suspected U.S. drone killed four alleged al-Qaeda militants in a volatile eastern province of the country.

The drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men around 2 a.m. local time, setting it on fire and killing all of them, the officials said.

The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, along with other Western delegations including the British Embassy, have been closed since Sunday due to the threats. Several foreign embassies have closed their doors in Yemen until at least Thursday in reaction to the threat that is perceived to be at its highest in the final days of the holy-month of Ramadan and going into the Muslim festival of Eid that begins Wednesday.

Despite the reaction among the international community to the apparent imminent al-Qaeda threat, in Sanaa there appeared little visible signs of tightened security across the capital other than the regular checkpoints that dot the city.

Yemen's President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi, who recently returned from a visit to Washington, has struggled to maintain security while implementing U.S.-backed military restructuring plans following Yemen's 2011 revolution that brought to an end 33 years of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule.

The reformation of Yemen's military, which divided in March 2011 during the uprising, and the removal of Saleh's family members who controlled several powerful units, has caused friction within the air force and army challenging Hadi's authority.

Assassinations of military and intelligence personnel have become widespread in Yemen over the last 18 months since the reorganization of the army and air force began. Improvised explosive devices have also been discovered with increasing regularity this year with a rising number of kidnappings and attacks on oil and electricity lines compounding a sense of lawlessness and highlighting Yemen's weak central government control.

The last known AQAP-linked attack in the capital came in September, when the minister of defense survived a car-bombing that left 12 dead -- one of multiple attempts made on his life.

Since June 2012 the militants have dispersed across several provinces resulting in unprecedented increase in U.S.-drone strikes being carried out across the country.

AQAP has been widely considered al-Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate for several years. The group is linked to the botched Christmas Day 2009 bombing of an airliner bound for Detroit and explosives-laden parcels intercepted aboard cargo flights a year later — both incidents involving al-Asiri's expertise.

President Obama and others have consistently alluded to the weakening of core al-Qaeda in Pakistan — particularly since a Navy SEAL team killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan two years ago. Obama frequently touts bin Laden's death in his speeches, and has declared that the terror group was ""on the path to defeat.""

On Monday, officials declined to be more specific about the latest threat.

""What we know is the threat emanates from, and may be focused on, occurring in the Arabian Peninsula,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""It could potentially be beyond that, or elsewhere.""

The State Department on Sunday closed a total of 19 diplomatic posts in the Middle East and Africa, including in Bangladesh, Madagascar, Burundi, Rwanda and Mauritius.

Thomas Sanderson, co-director of the Transnational Threats Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the balance between overreacting and underreacting is a difficult one to strike.

""Inducing such widespread embassy closings may constitute a public-relations victory for AQAP and the al-Qaeda network generally,"" Sanderson said.

http://news.yahoo.com/taliban-attack-presidential-palace-afghanistan-030026459.html,,[],Taliban attack presidential palace in Afghanistan,"KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Suicide attackers blew up a car bomb and battled security forces outside Afghanistan's presidential palace Tuesday after infiltrating one of the most secure areas of the capital. The army said the attackers were killed but knew of no other deaths.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which came as reporters were gathering for a news event on Afghan youth at which President Hamid Karzai was expected to talk about ongoing efforts to open peace talks with the militant group.

The palace is in a large fortified area of downtown Kabul that also includes the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters for the NATO-led coalition forces. Access is heavily restricted. It houses Karzai's residence but it was not immediately clear whether the president was in the building at the time and his spokesman did not answer his phone.

Gunfire started around 6:30 a.m. inside a heavily guarded area near the east gate leading to the palace next to the Afghan Ministry of Defense and the former Ariana Hotel, which former U.S. intelligence officials have confirmed is used by the CIA.

Kabul police chief Gen. Mohamad Ayub Salangi said three or four gunmen jumped out of their SUV and opened fire after being stopped by security forces while trying to use fake documents to get through a checkpoint. All gunmen were killed, and one palace security guard was wounded, he said.

A car bomb then exploded as it tried to enter the area. About 20 journalists took cover behind a religious shrine, pulling a schoolboy off the street who had been caught in the open on his way to school.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility, saying in a text message the militants had ""brought death to the enemy"" with a suicide attack. He later suggested in an emailed statement that all three buildings had been targeted, saying the attack came ""near the Ariana Hotel, the important CIA base, and also the presidential palace and Ministry of Defense.""

Story continues

Smoke could be seen coming from the area of the hotel, but there was no immediate indication any of the buildings were hit in the attack.

Mujahid claimed the attackers had inflicted ""heavy casualties,"" but Afghanistan's Kabul division army commander Gen. Kadam Shah Shahim said he knew of no deaths among security forces or civilians.

He said his forces killed all of the attackers after they jumped out of their vehicle and opened fire.

The NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan instituted a camp lockdown during the incident and said in a short statement that its forces had been ready to assist but were not called in by Afghan authorities.

The U.S. Embassy cancelled all consular appointments and advised American citizens in Kabul to stay indoors but had no immediate comment on the incident.

The Taliban have indicated they are willing to open peace talks with the U.S. and the Afghanistan government and just last week opened an office in Qatar for possible negotiations.

But at the same time they have not renounced violence and attacks have continued across Afghanistan.

Pollak'],Hidden Hagel 2008 Speech Surfaces: No Attack on Iran Even if Israel Threatened,"New footage of a speech by Chuck Hagel in 2008 has surfaced, in which the former Senator mocked the idea of continuing the U.S. policy of confronting Iran and supporting Israel. “When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point,” he told the laughing audience at an event for his book, America: Our Next Chapter.

Hagel added that the U.S. “shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran,” even in the event of a nuclear attack on Israel, and suggested Israel would be the first to attack Iran with a nuclear weapon.

Hagel told the Senate on Jan. 31 that he could not provide records or video for more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given over the previous five years because they had not been transcribed or recorded:

We have given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there. On paid speeches, most every one of those paid speeches–in the contract it says that they are private and not videotaped. That wasn’t my decision. That was the contract of the group I spoke to. I believe every paid speech I gave I didn’t have a prepared text. I gave it extemporaneously, which is something I’ve been doing for long before I left the Senate.

However, records and recordings of many of those speeches do exist, suggesting the administration either did not perform the due diligence necessary to comply with the Senate’s request, or that Hagel misled the Senate.

In the new footage, which was uploaded to YouTube and is apparently from a question-and-answer session after his formal remarks, Hagel fields a question about whether the U.S. would attack Iran to help defend Israel from an attack by Iran or one of its proxies that threatened Israel’s existence. He says that the U.S. should not attack Iran, and that the U.S. should “engage” Iran instead–even in those circumstances:

Q: [I]f Israel is attacked by Iran or an Iranian proxy like Hezbollah in a way that existentially threatens Israel, almost to the extent that Israel was attacked in ’73 and it’s existentially threatened, would you support an American airstrike using U.S. forces, B2s, whatever on Iran?” A: I’ll answer the question as honestly as I can. That’s a hypothetical question that somehow frames up the simplicity of the hypothetical question. The complications in the Middle East, and I’m certainly not an expert there, I have a chapter on the Middle East, I do know [laughter], I know a little something about the Middle East. I spent a lot of time there. And I spent a lot of time in Israel with the prime minister and others. You, who are well informed on this issue know the complexities starting with–go back to the Bible, go back to ancient times, thousands of years. I mean that, if you really want to start trying to understand the Middle East, Paul, or David Aaron Miller, who you may know, has a new book out on this, The Not So Promised Land, [sic]. And if you want to read something that is very, very enlightening, this guy, he’s getting tremendous reviews on it. He’s Jewish. He worked in the State Department , worked for Baker, worked for Albright, I think he’s worked for four Secretaries of State, different Democrats, Republicans. But it’s a great, great book. But your question, I mean the complication of what’s going on there, Hamas is already attacking Israel. Iran supports Hamas. Iran supports Hezbollah. What I would much rather see is this administration, or hopefully the next administration, engage Iran, engage Syria. When I hear the talk about–well you can’t talk with Iran, you can’t talk with Syria and we’re, we should stay where we are and support Israel, and so on, well you miss the point. Our policy has been so successful I believe, hasn’t it [laughter], that the Middle East is far better off today than it’s ever been, isn’t it? [Laughter.] I mean all those countries, Lebanon is in great shape, Gaza is in great shape, Israel is in good shape, Iran, Iraq, things have never looked better, because we won’t talk to anybody. We are not going to have peace, stability, security or anything that even hints of it in the Middle East until Iran and Syria and all the players are part of it. Now that doesn’t apologize for, or doesn’t close our eyes to what Iran has been doing, what Iran does do. But unless they are engaged in some way, then I don’t see this getting any better. And where this could go, where this could eventually go–somebody was asking me the other day about a nuclear exchange in the world, where that would come from? And I said, well, I’ll give you a scenario that’s very real. If Israel gets backed up enough into a corner, and Israel uses a tactical theater nuclear weapon–you want to talk about seeing some things unravel in the world. The United States shouldn’t even be thinking about the options of bombing Iran or anybody else. I mean, we got our hands full right now… [Applause]

“Anyone who can claim that an attack of this staggering scale could be contrived or fabricated needs to check their conscience and their own moral compass,” he said, in a barb likely meant for Syria and its patron Russia. “By any standard it is inexcusable, and despite the excuses and equivocations that some have manufactured, it is undeniable.""

Kerry, speaking to reporters at the State Department, spoke of the attack in very personal terms, describing how he had watched the “gut-wrenching” videos of the dead and dying via social media. But he gave no details about when a decision on whether to use force in response to last week’s massacre might come — or whether it would.

The secretary of state said the United States government and its allies were reviewing nonpublic information about the alleged attack and promised that “we will provide that information in the days ahead.”

“Make no mistake, President (Barack) Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world’s most heinous weapons against the world’s most vulnerable people,” Kerry warned. “Nothing today is more serious and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny.”

The top U.S. diplomat offered no new public evidence to back up U.S. charges that the Assad regime used chemical weapons in an attack just outside Damascus that anti-Assad fighters say might have killed more than 1,300. But he made a public case against the Syrian strongman that might underpin a future legal rationale for American military strikes.

""While investigators are gathering additional evidence on the ground, our understanding of what has already happened in Syria is grounded in facts informed by conscience and guided by common sense,"" Kerry said. ""The reported number of victims, the reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, the firsthand accounts from humanitarian organizations on the ground like Doctors Without Borders and the Syria Human Rights Commission — these all strongly indicate that everything these images are already screaming at us is real, that chemical weapons were used in Syria.""

Story continues

Syria possesses chemical weapons, and the rockets to deliver them, Kerry said. ""We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place. And with our own eyes, we have all of us become witnesses.""

And Kerry shared his personal response to shocking social media videos shared by the opposition.

After a round of telephone diplomacy on Sunday, Kerry said, “I went back and I watched videos — videos that anybody can watch on social media — I watched them one more gut-wrenching time.”

“As a father, I can’t get the image out of my head, of a man who held up his dead child, wailing, while chaos swirled around,” he said.

“The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity,” he underlined.

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would explain his decision to the American public once he has made it and already has started reaching out to key members of Congress.

Asked whether polls showing weak U.S. public support for intervention would shape the president's decision, Carney replied: ""The president makes decisions about military action or potential military action with the national security interests of the United States in mind.""

""I am sure that you will hear from him."""
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/20/decision-to-extend-trusted-traveler-program-to-saudi-scrutinized/,2013-03-20 00:00:00,[],DHS questioned over decision to let Saudi passengers skip normal passport controls,"A Department of Homeland Security program intended to give ""trusted traveler"" status to low-risk airline passengers soon will be extended to Saudi travelers, opening the program to criticism for accommodating the country that produced 15 of the 19 hijackers behind the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Sources voiced concern about the decision to the Investigative Project on Terrorism, which issued a report Wednesday on the under-the-radar announcement -- which was first made by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano after meeting in January with her Saudi counterpart. According to the IPT, this would be the first time the Saudi government has been given such a direct role in fast-tracking people for entry into the United States.

""I think you have radical Wahhabism in certain elements in Saudi Arabia, and I think to be more lenient there than in other places would be a mistake,"" Rep. Frank Wolf told the Investigative Project on Terrorism. ""There were 15 [hijackers] from that country, and there is a lot taking place in that region.""

Only an exclusive handful of countries enjoy inclusion in the Global Entry program -- Canada, Mexico, South Korea and the Netherlands. According to the IPT, some officials are questioning why Saudi Arabia gets to reap the benefits of the program, when key U.S. allies like Germany and France are not enrolled; Israel has reached a deal with the U.S., but that partnership has not yet been implemented.

Any Saudi travelers cleared through the program will be able to bypass the normal customs line after providing passports and fingerprints. The status lasts for five years.

The decision is a turnaround, the IPT notes, from when Saudi Arabia was briefly placed on a list of countries whose U.S.-bound travelers would face higher scrutiny, in the wake of the failed Christmas Day bombing attempt in 2009.

But Napolitano spoke highly of ""the bond between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"" when she announced the change in January.

""By enhancing collaboration with the government of Saudi Arabia, we reaffirm our commitment to more effectively secure our two countries against evolving threats while facilitating legitimate trade and travel,"" Napolitano said.

The Global Entry program was launched in 2008 to expedite pre-approved passengers through the airport customs and security process when they arrive in the U.S. The program is designed to weed out low-risk passengers and enable authorities to zero in on those who may be more likely to pose a threat.

But the program has sparked controversy in the past. Critics objected in late 2010 when Mexican citizens were included in the program, raising concerns that drug cartels would quickly learn how to exploit loopholes in the plan. DHS officials, however, insisted at the time that people who attain trusted traveler status don't get a free pass and are still subject to random searches.

The program allows travelers who have undergone a thorough vetting process -- fingerprinting, background checks, interviews with customs agents, etc.-- to attain a low-risk status that allows them to skip the line at customs and complete their entry process at an automatic kiosk."

“Down, Down with Ikhwan!” they chanted in reference to the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Egypt’s army cracked down on Muslim Brotherhood protesters, the Islamist group and its supporters have torched dozens of churches and attacked Christians.

Muslim women in hijabs could be seen mingling among their Christian neighbors and joining in the chants.

Protesters later marched to the headquarters of the Washington Post and CNN to express anger at the lack of coverage given to the attacks on Egyptian Christians. Then they went to the Council on American Islamic Relations’ (CAIR) headquarters. Protest organizers consider CAIR to be the Muslim Brotherhood’s “embassy” in Washington.

The sight of hundreds of angry protesters outside its building prompted theWashington Post to lock down its lobby.

Protesters defended the Egyptian military’s decision to forcefully clear out the Muslim Brotherhood protesters staging sit-ins in Cairo, and they chided the Obama administration for condemning the military’s action.

“Egypt right now is dealing with terrorists,” said protester Sherif Mina. “I mean, he’s talking about peaceful demonstrations in Egypt by the Muslim Brotherhood. Is it peaceful when you carry machine guns, and artillery weapons – and all these kinds of torture that they’ve done to the Egyptian people, and the neighborhoods that they were sitting in?”

Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged the popular Egyptian belief that the military intervened at the request of the people. But talk of cutting off U.S. aid in the wake of the army’s crackdown – in which hundreds were killed – seems to have reinforced protesters’ perceptions that the Obama administration has sided with the Brotherhood.

Many Egyptians now consider the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terrorist organization that destroyed the fabric of Egyptian society during its year in power, protesters said. That belief was proven by street protests against President Mohamed Morsi – the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate – which drew an estimated 30 million Egyptians. American foreign policy should back the majority of Egyptians who do not want the Muslim Brotherhood back, protesters said.

They also called for a secular, free and democratic Egypt.

Basic necessities became scarce under Muslim Brotherhood rule, electricity became sporadic, gas lines were common, and poor Egyptians were being hurt by the declining value of the Egyptian Pound by the time 30 million Egyptians took to the streets to say they had enough.

As the army violently clamped down, Islamists turned to Egypt’s Christian minority as easy scapegoats or accused the military of promoting “Islamophobia.” But that didn’t fly with Muslims who joined Thursday’s protest in Washington.

“All of the Egyptians they are found the Muslim Brotherhood they are just failures and liars about everything they are told us they will do it in my country,” said Nessma Salem, an Egyptian Muslim woman who came from New York to attend the rally. “Unfortunately they make a lot of other things. They don’t want to even admit they are liars. So the problem is all the Muslims, and all the Christians, and all of the Egyptian people they are just go to all of the street again after two years. They told us they do not want the Muslim Brotherhood to control the whole country again because they are failures and unfortunately they are support definitely terrorists.”

Other protesters shared her angst about the damage done to Egypt’s economy under Muslim Brotherhood rule. Given the massive popular outcry, Morsi’s removal from office was not a coup.

“[30] million people came out in the street saying we don’t want this regime. It’s a terror regime – a terrorist regime killing everyone,” said protester Fred Soliman. “They tried to rule the country by themselves and not share it with anyone else, so the whole country, the whole country [30] million people all over Egypt. They say no to that regime.”

President Obama has not mentioned Coptic Christians by name since the violence began. The closest he came was a brief, veiled reference to churches being attacked by Islamists last week. “We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully and condemn the attacks that we’ve seen by protesters, including on churches,” he said. The State Department has issued several statements condemning the attacks on the over 60 churches over the past week, but the Copts feel these statements have not been forceful enough.

These tepid statements, together with the perception that the Obama administration was excessively deferential to the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in power, fueled their resentment.

“We as the Coptic Christians of Egypt would like to live in peace, would like the Egyptians to decide their future. We don’t want anyone to interfere in our future, would like the American government as well to the media to listen to all of the parties and to decide it by themselves,” said Fr. Mikhail E. Mikhail of St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Seven Hills, Ohio. “…We are here to say that what happened in Egypt is a revolution from the people, not a military rebellion.”

“The army is not going to rule in Egypt,” Mikhail said. “They chose a Supreme Court judge to be in the transition period, and at the same time they have a plan to give it to a civilian government. We want Egypt to be civilian and for Egypt to separate between religion and state like you do here in the United States of America.”"

President Obama made a statement on Saturday to update the country on his Syria deliberations

Members of his national security team briefed lawmakers on Saturday

Obama overrode top advisers%27 objections

WASHINGTON — President Obama said on Saturday that he was ready to take military action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime in retaliation for its alleged use of chemical weapons, but that he will seek the approval of Congress before carrying out any military strike.

Obama says congressional leaders have agreed to schedule a debate and vote when they return to session. They are scheduled to return from their summer recess on Sept. 9.

The president did not say whether he'd forgo a strike if Congress rejects his call to action.

""After careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets,"" Obama said. ""This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope.

""This attack is an assault on human dignity,"" Obama said of the alleged Aug. 21 chemical assault the U.S. intelligence community has linked to Assad's regime. ""It also presents a serious danger to our national security.""

The remarks came amid a flurry of briefings for skeptical lawmakers by the president's national security team. Shouts from hundreds of activists outside the White House protesting against military action could be heard from the Rose Garden shortly before Obama spoke.

""Over the last several days, we've heard from several members of Congress who want their voices to be heard,"" Obama said. ""I absolutely agree.""

House Speaker John Boehner announced in a joint statement with the GOP House leadership that he expected to consider a measure that would authorize the president to carry out a military strike the week of Sept. 9.

""Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,"" the statement said. ""We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. This provides the president time to make his case to Congress and the American people.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Obama's decision.

""The president's role as commander in chief is always strengthened when he enjoys the expressed support of the Congress,"" McConnell said.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization as ""absolutely the right decision."" Corker in recent weeks had been a public advocate for an authorization vote, contending that the Congress too often takes a back seat on determining critical foreign policy decisions.

Obama said some have advised not to seek Congress' approval, noting that the British Parliament this week rejected a similar call for action by Prime Minister David Cameron. Obama also rejected Boehner's notion that he must seek congressional authorization.

""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said. ""We should have this debate. The issues are too big for business as usual.""

The president's senior advisers had initially advised him not to seek congressional authorization for a military strike, according to a senior administration official.

Obama indicated last Saturday during a National Security Council meeting that he was leaning toward taking action against Syria, but had not made a final decision, said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal deliberations.

But when Obama convened his senior advisers on Friday night to tell them he had decided to take military action, he also told his advisers that he would seek Congressional authorization, the official said.

In the Friday night meeting and again on Saturday morning, Obama explained his reasoning to his advisers for seeking congressional backing. The same aides who had advised him not to go to lawmakers for backing threw their support behind his plan.

Obama's remarks on Saturday afternoon came hours after United Nations experts, who had been collecting samples from last week's alleged chemical weapons strike outside Damascus, left Syria bound for the Netherlands.

The chemical weapons experts were working to determine what occurred in the apparent chemical weapons attack near Damascus on Aug. 21, which U.S. intelligence reports say left 1,429 people dead, including 426 children. They have taken blood and urine samples from victims and soil samples from areas where chemical attacks have been reported. The samples will be tested in Europe.

Obama attempted to put the onus on Congress, which he suggested has a moral responsibility to take action. He noted that Americans have become weary after more than a decade of war, but that something as heinous as a chemical attack could not be ignored.

""Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?"" Obama said.

The president had long expressed skepticism about the merits of American involvement in the civil war in Syria that has left more than 100,000 dead. But Obama stated publicly just over a year ago that movement or deployment of chemical weapons was a ""red line"" that must not be crossed.

The White House had determined earlier this summer that Assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups.

Obama said that Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has advised him that the U.S. military's capacity to execute a strike is not time-sensitive. Five U.S. Navy destroyers equipped with land-attack cruise missiles are deployed in the eastern Mediterranean and stand ready to carry out an assault on the president's order.

""In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security,"" Obama said. ""And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote."""

The two leaders spent much of Saturday discussing the issue, which has gained prominence in recent months as private security firms and U.S. officials have become increasingly willing to speak publicly about alleged Chinese activities.

White House National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said the issue was ""at the center of the relationship"" between the two countries.

""It is not an adjunct issue,"" he said. ""It's an issue that is very much on the table at this point.""

Donilon said much of the discussion was focused on the theft of intellectual property -- a prime concern of the U.S. business community.

""It's quite obvious now that the Chinese senior leadership understand clearly the importance of this issue to the United States,"" Donilon said.

China has consistently denied any involvement in cyberattacks.

Xi said at a press conference Friday that China has itself been the victim of cyberattacks, but expressed optimism about working with the U.S. on the issue.

But no firm commitments on cyber-related issues were secured at the conference. Instead, the leaders announced a joint effort to combat climate change.

The United States has recently adopted a new strategy for combating what officials see as a persistent threat to the American military and economy: It has started naming China -- and its armed forces -- as the source of cyberattacks that pilfer military, trade and industry secrets.

The change in tactics follows years of virtual silence from American officials on the issue. The government's claims have been bolstered by a growing chorus of security firms and companies who say they have been attacked by Chinese hackers.

The New York Times and Wall Street Journal have said they were hacked. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant said it has traced other attacks to a Chinese military unit. A second security firm, Kaspersky Lab, fingered a China-based cyber-espionage group that has attacked more than 350 victims in 40 countries.

China is not the only country believed to be involved in cyberattacks. The existence of several other state-sponsored cyberweapons has also been reported in recent years, with names like Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame. The U.S. government is widely believed to have played a role in developing some of those viruses, with an eye toward containing Iran."

Early this morning, Snowden left the Moscow airport after he was granted temporary asylum by Russia.

Carney also stated that Snowden isn’t a whistleblower or a dissident and described the situation as ‘not a positive development’ for U.S.-Russia relations. The move undermines Russia’s record of law enforcement cooperation with the U.S.

The White House is considering cancelling a planned fall summit between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and private that Mr. Snowden be expelled and returned to the United States,” said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

Moscow did not give any advanced notice to the White House before they announced their decision to grant a one year, temporary asylum request to Snowden. Relations between the US are already strained because of differences regarding the war in Syria, but Putin did say the request was granted contingent upon Snowden refraining from hurting U.S. interests.

This “disappointment” is a switch from Obama’s cavalier attitude toward Snowden when the leaks were first brought to light. Initially, Obama dismissed Snowden and the NSA leaks to the media by saying “No, I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” Obama said.

The President also said “I shouldn’t have to” personally call the leaders of China and Russia to have them turn over Snowden after details of classified documents were made public.

“We’ve got a whole lot of business that we do with China and Russia,” Obama said. “And I’m not going to have one case of a suspect that we’re trying to extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I’ve got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited so that he can face the Justice system here in the United States.”

Snowden writes open letter to %27people of Brazil%27

Says he wants asylum in return for technical help

Letter was published online in the %27Folha%27 newspaper

Edward Snowden has written an ""open letter to the people of Brazil"" offering to help Brazil's government investigate allegations of U.S. spying, but on the condition that he be granted permanent political asylum.

The letter was first published Tuesday in Brazil's Folha newspaper.

""I've expressed my willingness to assist where it's appropriate and legal, but, unfortunately, the U.S. government has been working hard to limit my ability to do so,"" the letter says.

The letter was first made available on the newspaper's website in Portuguese. USA TODAY read a version of the letter using online translation software. It was subsequently posted on Facebook by an account apparently belonging to David Miranda, the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, the Brazil-based American journalist who was the recipient of thousands of documents detailing the National Security Agency's spying programs.

It was not entirely clear from the letter whether Snowden was suggesting that the South American nation should grant him asylum in return for help in probing claims that the U.S. has spied on Brazil.

""Until a country grants me permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak out,"" Snowden writes in the letter.

He says that, ""Many Brazilian senators agree and asked me to help their investigations into suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.""

In response to a tweet Tuesday, Greenwald told USA TODAY that ""if media outlets want to report what they think is the ""sub-text,"" that's fine — but they should report its actual content."" Earlier, Greenwald characterized many media summaries of the letter to Brazil as ""wrong.""

On Monday. Snowden said he felt vindicated by a federal judge's ruling that the collection of data by the National Security Agency was most likely unconstitutional.

""Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights. It is the first of many,"" the former NSA contractor said in a statement.

Snowden has been granted asylum in Russia until next summer.

""Six months ago, I revealed that the NSA wanted to listen to the whole world. Now, the whole world is listening back, and speaking out, too. And the NSA doesn't like what it's hearing,"" he says in Tuesday's letter."

A bed in a provincial refugee hostel and little prospect of a decent job. That is what NSA leaker Edward Snowden can expect if and when he is allowed out of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport to await word on his application for temporary refuge, Russian media observed in a flurry of articles and commentaries Monday.

The reports by the Russia Today network and the official Itar-Tass news service were replete with admonition and doom-filled forecasts. The warnings seemed to suggest that Russian officials, rather than making a no-win decision between extraditing Snowden to Washington or granting him temporary asylum, are simply dragging their feet in hopes that the political albatross decides on his own to end his monthlong limbo in the bowels of Moscow’s main international airport.

Snowden, 30, has been stuck in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo since his arrival from Hong Kong on June 23, a day after his U.S. passport was revoked for his disclosure of top-secret National Security Agency surveillance programs that collect private communications data on millions. With no valid travel document, Snowden can neither clear Russian passport control and enter the capital, nor can he buy tickets to fly to another destination.

“Snowden has been living in Sheremetyevo airport for over a month, and there is no doubt that the lack of fresh air, dietary options and ability to move freely has put enormous strain on him,” Russia Today began its commentary titled “The Layover From Hell.”

It noted that should the fugitive’s July 16 application for temporary asylum be accepted, “he will have to undergo a daunting medical assessment designed especially for immigrants.” That would include screening for HIV, tuberculosis, leprosy and the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, the network noted.

Snowden will have to register his whereabouts with police at all times and will probably be limited to finding a room in a processing facility for asylum seekers far from the capital.

“There are no such facilities in Moscow, and ones in the vicinity have been flooded with refugees escaping the Syrian conflict,” human rights lawyer Elena Ryabinina told the Gazeta.ru online newspaper. She said the nearest one with vacancy was probably Perm, 600 miles east of Moscow and the site of one of Russia’s most notorious prisons.

Piling on the unsolicited advice about Snowden’s travel and accommodation woes was the spokesman for the Federal Migration Service that is reviewing his petition for asylum.

“I don’t think it is good for Snowden to travel freely in Russia, as he is a wanted man,” said the migration service press secretary, Vladimir Volokh. He observed that outside of the airport, “his personal security cannot be guaranteed.”

That is a loaded phrase implying that Russian security agents won’t be watching his back for any CIA-style operations of the type that snatched terrorism suspects off foreign streets and “renditioned” them to U.S. custody for interrogation.

Soviet-era defectors who took refuge in Russia generally suffered miserable fates, the network noted.

“Kim Philby and Guy Burgess drank themselves to death in their state-allocated flats, awaiting a world revolution that never came,” the article recalled of British double agents who defected to Moscow in the 1960s and never adjusted to their lives in exile.

Itar-Tass took a similarly warning tone in an article that sounded out Russian information technology leaders about the prospects of Snowden finding a job in his field of data analysis, if and when he gets out of the airport. IT companies “are in no haste to offer a job” to the fugitive, who would be of more use to Russian intelligence or security forces, the news agency said.

“The risk of giving a job to Snowden is that he already showed his disloyalty to the employer once,” said Yelena Semenova, a deputy director for personnel management at the Informzashchita company, a name that translates as “information defense.”

Other leading tech companies told the news service that they had no idea of Snowden’s skill level, as all that is known about him is what he has disclosed in defiance of security clearances that governed his job with NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii.

Snowden is stuck in the airport “because he has been trapped,” political analyst Fyodor Lukyanov, who edits the journal Russia in Global Affairs, told Russia Today. “There is a possibility that the most eventful part of his life is already behind him.... In all likelihood, Snowden will have nothing to do in Russia.”

http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/12/politics/syria-putin-analysis/index.html,2013-09-12 00:00:00,['Jill Dougherty'],Analysis: Putin scores diplomatic win on Syria,"Story highlights Obama and Putin in high-stakes diplomatic wrangling over Syria Putin gets upper hand by giving Obama way out of military strike for now Syria chemical weapons issue now at UN, just where Russian leader wants it White House tries to throw the ball back to Putin, saying he must deliver

(CNN) —

Russians and Americans have been duking it out in the Twitter world over who’s scoring more points in high-stakes diplomatic wrangling over Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama or Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted Thursday: “Three days ago there seemed no diplomatic way to hold Assad accountable. Threat of U.S. action finally brought Russia to the table.”

In her tweet, Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia’s English-language television network RT, quipped: “If the Russian proposal on Syria works, Obama, as an honest man, has to give his Nobel Prize to Putin.”

Taking Syria’s chemical weapons out of government control and preventing another horrendous attack on civilians is too serious an issue to reduce to political one-upmanship.

But after Putin’s bombshell opinion piece in the New York Times in which, among other things, he takes America to task for an “alarming” pattern of intervening in the internal conflicts of foreign countries, it’s obvious something has shifted.

“It absolutely is a diplomatic win by Putin right now,” said Fiona Hill, expert on Putin and director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution.

“If we think about this as judo, which is of course Mr. Putin’s favorite sport, this is just one set of moves,” she said. “And right now, he’s managed to get Obama off the mat, at least, and get the terms set down that play to his advantage.”

Putin’s comments cause a fuss

Putin stopped Obama’s drive for military action against Syria in its tracks this week as Russia’s plan to put Syria’s chemical weapons under international control pushes the action to the United Nations, just where Putin wants it.

Russia has veto power in the U.N. Security Council, and as Hill noted, it’s an “arena that they’re really very skilled at, which is usually blocking other people from getting resolutions or moving forward.”

Putin’s op-ed is not going down lightly in Washington. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up.

“Mr. Putin’s personality has been widely demonized in the Western world, so anything that comes from Mr. Putin will be met not only with skepticism but a lot of people will reject just out of hand anything that Mr. Putin will say,” said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

“However, in this particular situation, when so many people are confused in the United States, in Europe, including in the political classes of Western countries, the arguments that Putin is making so clearly could be used in the domestic debate,” he added.

Analysis: Is Obama a winner or loser on Syria?

Trenin thinks Putin “is trying to insert himself and the Russian position into the debate that’s now ongoing on Capitol Hill, within the U.S. more broadly, in the European countries. He does not want to leave the field to Westerners alone. He wants to have a voice in that discussion.”

Arguments Putin presents in his op-ed struck a chord with some in Washington, even if they dislike him.

One example: “Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government.”

Other points, like his swipe at Obama’s comment this week trumpeting American “exceptionalism,” are bound to irritate some of the Americans Putin is trying to sway.

Sen. James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, said Thursday that “Putin was lecturing to the United States, and I could hear (Ronald) Reagan turning over in his grave as this was going on.”

Some Russians claim that Obama “owes” Putin for getting him out of a bind. Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted tartly: “Obama should be ‘for’ Russia’s plan with two hands. It gives him a chance not to start a new war, not lose in the Congress, and not become another Bush,” referring to his predecessor.

Hill said Putin did do Obama a favor.

“For Putin, being the old KGB guy, having someone owe him something is always to his advantage,” she said.

“But this is more about a win for Russia here. Russia gets an imminent U.S. strike off the table for a while,” Hill said.

The White House is trying to throw the ball back to Putin, cautioning that his chemical weapons proposal will boomerang if it doesn’t work.

Putin “now owns this. He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver,” a senior White House official told CNN.

Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and former deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, tweeted: “If Kerry-Lavrov meeting exposes Russian proposal as sham, it will strengthen Obama’s hand with Congress, assuring what Putin hopes to stop.”

Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who leaked top-secret documents about U.S. surveillance programs, fled Hong Kong for Moscow on Sunday with the assistance of the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks and asked the government of Ecuador to grant him asylum.

Snowden’s ultimate destination was uncertain, but Ricardo Patiño, Ecuador’s foreign minister, tweeted Sunday afternoon that his government had received a request for asylum from Snowden. WikiLeaks released a statement saying Snowden was “bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum.”

According to the Associated Press, Snowden is set to leave Moscow for Havana Monday on an Aeroflot flight that leaves at 2:05 p.m. (6:05 a.m. EDT).

Despite U.S. officials’ insistence that Snowden’s passport was revoked Saturday, the Hong Kong government said Sunday that he left “on his own accord for a third country.”

Aeroflot told the Associated Press that Snowden registered for the flight on Sunday using his U.S. passport.

The United States charged Snowden with espionage on June 21. Guardian via AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Ecuadoran diplomats were at Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Snowden landed aboard an Aeroflot flight about 5:05 p.m. (9:05 a.m. EDT). It was not clear whether they were meeting with Snowden or with others who accompanied him. Snowden did not have a Russian visa, according to several sources, so he was confined to a transit area within the airport.

WikiLeaks, which has published hundreds of thousands of classified documents over the past several years, said it is aiding Snowden in his bid to avoid a return to the United States. Snowden, 30, had fled to Hong Kong, where he revealed two weeks ago that he was the source of leaked National Security Agency documents. Federal prosecutors in Virginia filed espionage charges against him June 14 and had asked Hong Kong to detain him.

“The U.S. is disappointed and disagrees with the determination by Hong Kong authorities not to honor the U.S. request for the arrest of the fugitive, Edward J. Snowden,” a Justice Department spokesman said Sunday. The spokesman, who declined to be identified, added that authorities in the United States and Hong Kong had “been in continual contact” since June 10, when the Justice Department learned that Snowden was in the Chinese territory.

WikiLeaks said Snowden was accompanied on his flight to Moscow by Sarah Harrison, who the organization said is a British citizen, journalist and researcher working with the WikiLeaks legal defense team.

Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic investigative journalist and spokesman for WikiLeaks, said in a phone interview that Snowden would overnight in Moscow, which he described as “not a final destination.” He declined to say when Snowden would be departing or where his final stop would be.

Hrafnsson said he established contact with Snowden last week while the American was in Hong Kong. Arrangements were made for Harrison to meet Snowden in Hong Kong and accompany him out. Harrison was still with Snowden in Moscow, Hrafnsson said.

“The WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr. Snowden’s rights and protecting him as a person,” said Baltasar Garzón, legal director of WikiLeaks and attorney for Julian Assange, the group’s founder, who has spent the past year holed up in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London. “What is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange — for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest — is an assault against the people.”

View Graphic The flight of Edward Snowden

U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of ongoing diplomacy regarding Snowden, said his passport had been revoked before he left Hong Kong.

The State Department said privacy laws prevented it from commenting on Snowden’s passport.

“As is routine and consistent with U.S. regulations, persons with felony arrest warrants are subject to having their passport revoked,” said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. “. . . Persons wanted on felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States.”

But the Interfax news agency, quoting a Russian law enforcement source, said Snowden could continue on his journey from Moscow without a U.S. passport if the country where he was seeking asylum provided him with travel documents. Those documents could include affirmation of refugee status, Interfax reported, or even a passport from the destination country.

In a statement Sunday night, NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said: “We are disappointed by the decision of the authorities in Hong Kong to permit Mr. Snowden to flee despite the legally valid U.S. request to arrest him for purposes of his extradition under the U.S.-Hong Kong Surrender Agreement. We have registered our strong objections to the authorities in Hong Kong as well as to the Chinese government through diplomatic channels and noted that such behavior is detrimental to U.S.-Hong Kong and U.S.-China bilateral relations.”

Given Russia’s recent intense cooperation with the United States after the Boston Marathon bombing and the nation’s history of working with Russia on law enforcement matters, she added, “We expect the Russian Government to look at all options available to expel Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. to face justice for the crimes with which he is charged.”

Russia’s role under fire

The apparent cooperation of the Russian government in Snowden’s attempt to avoid extradition to the United States outraged some members of Congress.

“What’s infuriating here is [President Vladimir] Putin of Russia aiding and abetting Snowden’s escape,” Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“The bottom line is very simple,” Schumer said. “Allies are supposed to treat each other in decent ways, and Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran and now, of course, with Snowden. That’s not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.”

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) agreed that Sunday’s events call “into question what kind of relationship we ever have had with China and Russia. We pretend that everything is hunky-dory when it is not. It isn’t with China. It isn’t with Russia. It certainly isn’t with Cuba, with Venezuela nor with Ecuador.”

She added: “These are countries that violate press freedoms every day. And yet [Snowden]’s seeking political asylum in those very countries where . . . if he were to pull a Snowden in these countries, they’d jail him immediately.”

Hong Kong’s government said that the U.S. request for a warrant for Snowden’s arrest “did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law” and that it had asked for “additional information.”

“As the HKSAR Government has yet to have sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving Hong Kong,” the statement said.

A senior Justice Department official disputed that claim. “The request met the requirements of the agreement,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “They came back to us late Friday with additional questions, and we were in the process of responding. Obviously, this raises concerns for us, and we will continue to discuss this with the authorities there.”

The United States had asked Hong Kong to issue a provisional arrest warrant and filed charges against Snowden, including theft, “unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.”

If Snowden is relocating to Ecuador, he will have limited travel options. There are no direct flights from Moscow to Quito, and many would-be layover destinations would probably heed Washington’s request to detain him. One likely exception would be Havana. There are direct flights from Moscow to Havana five days a week, including Mondays, and a direct flight from Havana to Quito on Fridays.

Patiño, the Ecuadoran foreign minister, recently said Quito would be willing to consider an asylum claim by Snowden. Speaking at a news conference in London after visiting Assange last Monday, Patiño suggested that his nation would approve such a request.

On Monday, Patiño was in Vietnam and said that the nation is “in touch with the highest authorities of Russia” about an asylum claim from Snowden, according to the Associated Press. He said that the request “has to do with freedom of expression and with the security of citizens around the world,” and that Ecuador will not make its decision based on its relationship with the United States.

“There are some governments that act more upon their own interests, but we do not,” Patiño said, according to the Associated Press. “We act upon our principles.”

He added, “We take care of the human rights of the people.”

Assange has been unable to leave the Ecuadoran Embassy because Britain has refused to provide him safe passage while he is sought by Sweden for questioning about sexual-assault allegations.

U.S. relations with Ecuador

Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa has emerged as one of the most vehement critics of U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere. In 2011, his administration expelled the American ambassador in Quito to protest a cable released by WikiLeaks that alleged the Ecuadoran police force was rife with corruption.

The extradition treaty between the United States and Ecuador, signed in 1872, states that offenses of “a political character” do not warrant extradition — much like the United States’ agreement with Hong Kong.

It’s unclear whether the Chinese leadership in Beijing had any role in Hong Kong’s decision to let Snowden leave. Hong Kong is a semiautonomous region that prides itself on its independent legal system, but the government ultimately answers to the mainland, whose influence can be difficult to discern. Residents in Hong Kong are deeply resistant to any overt sign of interference from the Communist Party.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing said in a statement Sunday that it had seen the reports of Snowden’s departure and would continue to pay attention to developments but did not have “specific details.” The government added that it was “deeply concerned” about reports of U.S. government cyberattacks on China, saying they “proved that China is a victim of cyberattacks.”

Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined five options that he said the U.S. military could carry out if ordered by the White House: stepping up training and advising of the rebels, conducting limited airstrikes, establishing a no-fly zone, setting up a buffer zone inside Syria outside government control and securing Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile.

Dempsey described the options and the risks that each carries in a letter to Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During a hearing last week on Dempsey’s nomination for a second two-year term, Levin had asked for steps the U.S. could take on Syria.

Dempsey said there were “ongoing deliberations” over the U.S. role in Syria within the Obama administration, which announced two months ago that it was stepping up military aid to the rebels after concluding that President Bashar Assad’s government had used chemical weapons.

The limited U.S. effort to train and equip rebels so far has been handled by the CIA. Bringing in the military to conduct training would take “several hundred to several thousand” U.S. troops in safe areas outside Syria and cost $500 million a year, Dempsey said. It would carry the risk that extremists fighting on the side of the rebels would gain “additional capabilities” and raise the possibility of cross-border attacks by Syrian government forces.

The U.S. could also opt for strikes using aircraft and missiles fired from outside Syria, which could potentially hit “hundreds” of military targets and significantly degrade the government’s strength over time, he said. But doing so would take hundreds of aircraft, ships and submarines. Syria could potentially “withstand limited strikes by dispersing its assets,” he said.

A no-fly zone over Syria would prevent Assad’s government from using its aircraft to bomb rebel-held areas and resupply its troops. But it would require hundreds of aircraft, based at sea and in nearby countries, and cost as much as $1 billion a month, Dempsey said. The U.S. could also lose aircraft as it sought to eliminate the government’s air defense system, and “it may also fail to reduce the violence” because most attacks on rebels are conducted by Syrian ground units, not aircraft, he said.

The creation of buffer zones in Syria near its borders with Jordan or Turkey would allow rebels to train and permit distribution of humanitarian aid, Dempsey said. But setting up such a zone would require a limited no-fly zone as well as thousands of U.S. troops, costing more than $1 billion a month.

Controlling Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles would require air and missile strikes, as well as thousands of special operations troops, Dempsey said. “The impact would be the control of some but not all chemical weapons,” he said.

U.S. intervention would “likely further the narrow military objective of helping the opposition and placing more pressure on the regime,” Dempsey said. But he also warned that intervention would bring unanticipated consequences, echoing the cautious stance of the Obama administration, which has played down the prospect of direct U.S. military involvement in the war.

“Should the regime institutions collapse in the absence of a viable opposition, we could inadvertently empower extremists or unleash the very chemical weapons we seek to control,” Dempsey said.

At a security forum last week, David Shedd, the No. 2 official at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the Islamist militants among the Syrian opposition were becoming increasingly powerful and dangerous.

“The reality is that, left unchecked, they will become bigger,” Shedd told the Aspen Security Forum, an annual conference on security issues. “Over the last two years they’ve grown in size, they’ve grown in capability and ruthlessly have grown in effectiveness.”

Iran reportedly upgrading its uranium-enrichment program



Uranium can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear warheads

Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only

LONDON – Iran is attempting to speed up its uranium-enrichment program by upgrading technology at a key nuclear facility, diplomats with knowledge of the matter have told the Associated Press.

The diplomats were not named because they are not authorized to speak about the matter.

The diplomats said Iran has told the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency that it wants to install thousands of high-technology machines at its main enriching site at Natanz, in central Iran.

The machines can enrich two or three times faster than the present equipment being used by Tehran.

Uranium can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear warheads.

Separately, Reuters reported Thursday that it had seen a document sent by Iran to the IAEA which said that ""centrifuge machines type IR2m will be used in Unit A-22"" at Iran's facility in Natanz. Reuters said the details of the letter were divulged by a diplomat who declined to be identified.

On Thursday, Greg Webb, a press representative for the IAEA in Vienna, declined to comment on what the unnamed diplomats told the AP or on the document made available to Reuters.

Iran has maintained that it is refining uranium to meet its nuclear-energy needs, and that its nuclear program is being developed entirely for peaceful purposes. Many in the international community have raised doubts about that pledge."

(CNN) —

The news that Canadian law enforcement on Monday arrested two men accused of planning to derail a passenger train in the Toronto area has attracted much attention, in part, because the plotters are also charged with “receiving support from al Qaeda elements in Iran.”

If these allegations are true, it would appear to be the first time that al Qaeda elements based in Iran have directed some kind of plot in the West.

And it also underlines the perplexing relationship between the Shia theocratic state of Iran, which the Sunni ultra-fundamentalists who make up al Qaeda regard as heretical but with which they have had some kind of a marriage of convenience for many years.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

While there isn’t evidence that al Qaeda and the Iranian government have ever cooperated on a terrorist attack, al Qaeda’s ties to Iran, surprising perhaps to some, stretch back more than a decade.

As recently as October, the U.S. Treasury named as terrorists six al Qaeda members living in Iran who it alleged were sending fighters and money to Syria to fight Bashar al-Assad’s regime and were also funding terrorism in Pakistan.

Al Qaeda’s Iranian presence began after the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan during the winter of 2001 when some of Osama bin Laden’s family and his top lieutenants fled to neighboring Iran, where they lived under some form of house arrest.

They included Saif al-Adel, the Egyptian military commander of al Qaeda; Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bin Laden’s son-in-law and spokesman; and Saad bin Laden, one of the al Qaeda leader’s older sons who has played a leadership role in his father’s organization.

Saad helped bin Laden’s oldest wife, Khairiah bin Laden, and a number of his father’s children to move to Iran in 2002. Bin Laden’s sons Ladin, Uthman and Muhammad and his daughter Fatima, who is married to Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, settled in Tehran, the Iranian capital.

According to Saudi officials, it was from al Qaeda’s leaders in Iran that al Qaeda’s Saudi affiliate received the go-ahead in 2003 for a number of terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia that killed scores of Saudis and Westerners and targeted Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure.

In 2008, al Qaeda kidnapped Heshmatollah Attarzadeh-Niyaki, an Iranian diplomat living in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.

According to a Pakistani intelligence official familiar with the deal, al Qaeda released the diplomat back to Iran in 2010 as part of a negotiation that allowed some of bin Laden’s family and al Qaeda members then living in Iran to leave.

By now, relations between al Qaeda and Iran were tense.

In a letter recovered from the Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound where bin Laden was killed by a U.S. Navy SEAL team two years ago, bin Laden urged caution when his family members traveled out of Iran “since the Iranians are not to be trusted.”

Bin Laden wrote that his family “should be warned about the importance of getting rid of everything they received from Iran like baggage or anything even as small as a needle, as there are eavesdropping chips that have been developed to be so small they can be put inside a medical syringe.”

Last month Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bin Laden’s son-in-law and one-time al Qaeda spokesman, was brought to a Manhattan courtroom to face charges of conspiracy to kill Americans.

Abu Ghaith left the comparative safety of his longtime refuge in Iran for Turkey earlier this year. Turkey then deported him to his native Kuwait via Jordan, where he was detained by FBI agents who escorted him to New York.

Abu Ghaith and the two suspects just arrested in Canada, 30-year-old Chiheb Esseghaier of Montreal and 35-year-old Raed Jaser of Toronto, will obviously be the subject of much interest from U.S. and Canadian intelligence officials.

Those officials will surely be seeking answers to the precise nature of the Iranian government’s relationship with al Qaeda over the past decade.

Has it been passive acquiescence or more active complicity?

The Associated Press reported this month in an investigative article that Washington in 2011 authorized $1.3 billion for U.S. military electronics in Honduras. This is happening while the post-coup regime of Honduran President Porfirio Lobo is more out of control than ever, especially since the Honduran Congress staged a “technical coup” in December.

But as the Obama administration deepens its partnership with Honduras, ostensibly to fight the drug war, Democrats in Congress are increasingly rebelling. Here’s a message, then, for new Secretary of State John Kerry: Recast U.S. policy in Honduras and the murderous drug war that justifies it.

In the last few years, the U.S. has been ramping up its military operations throughout Latin America in what the Associated Press called “the most expensive initiative in Latin America since the Cold War.” The buildup has cost U.S. taxpayers more than $20 billion since 2002, for troops, ships, clandestine bases, radar, military and police training and other expenses.

U.S. military expenditures for Honduras in particular have gone up every year since 2009, when a military coup deposed democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya. At $67.4 million, 2012 Defense Department contracts for Honduras are triple those of 10 years ago. The U.S. spent $25 million last year to make the U.S. barracks at the Soto Cano air base permanent, and $89 million to keep 600 U.S. troops based there. U.S. direct aid to the Honduran military and police continues to climb as well.

But the Obama administration’s escalating military commitment in Honduras only deepens its support for the corrupt and repressive Lobo government. State security forces still enjoy near-complete impunity for thousands of alleged human rights abuses and even murders since the 2009 coup. The government hasn’t paid many of its teachers for at least six months, and the country is close to bankrupt.

On Dec. 13, in a clash of two equally corrupt groups of competing elites, the Honduran Congress illegally deposed four members of the Supreme Court, swearing in new justices within hours. Since then, the congress has run roughshod over the constitution, rapidly repassing a series of laws that had been overruled by the court, including a much-criticized mining law and a notorious law authorizing so-called model cities in which the constitution itself doesn’t apply.

These actions blatantly disregard the rule of law. Yet the U.S. State Department looked the other way at this “technical coup.”

In pouring U.S. military resources into the corrupt Honduran government, Washington argues that it is helping fight drug trafficking, which is indeed rampant, murderous and growing. But the Honduran government and the elites who control it are widely alleged to be implicated in the drug trafficking.

The drug war, though, does provide cover for a new wave of U.S. aggression in Latin America. Honduras, with the only large U.S. Air Force base between the United States and South America, has long been important as a linchpin of U.S. military domination of the region, including, most famously, U.S. involvement in the 1954 coup in Guatemala and the 1980s Contra war against the Nicaraguan government. Today, the expanding U.S. role poses an enormous threat to the whole region, and to Honduras’ sovereignty.

Moreover, as the media have reported, the Obama administration’s drug war in Honduras has been a disaster. In May 2012, agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration participated in an operation in which four Afro-indigenous villagers were killed and several others injured in the Mosquitia region of Honduras. The DEA acknowledges that it killed two alleged drug traffickers in separate incidents in June and July. In July, after the Honduran military shot down two supposed drug planes in violation of international protocol, the U.S. suspended radar cooperation for drug flights. In January, in the first joint operation after cooperation resumed, the Honduran coast guard killed an alleged drug trafficker utilizing intelligence provided by DEA agents.

Many Democrats in Congress have had enough. On Jan. 30, 58 members of the House, led by Reps. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles), John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) sent a letter to Kerry and Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. demanding that the May 2012 incident involving the DEA be investigated, calling attention to state-sponsored repression of Afro-indigenous Hondurans and questioning the drug war. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt. ) has on hold about $30 million in U.S. aid to Honduran security forces, pending answers to questions about abuses of civilians and corruption.

That’s a start, but Kerry and the administration need to reverse U.S. policy in Honduras altogether. End the bloody drug war and focus on job creation and social justice instead. Stop treating the current Honduran government like a friendly partner; instead, forthrightly denounce its human rights abuses and corruption of the rule of law. Help guarantee a free presidential election in November by condemning the assassinations of at least five opposition party activists and candidates in the last year, and demand adequate protection for the hundreds of Hondurans in the opposition who have received death threats.

In other words, stop arming Honduran thugs and allow those in the opposition the space to define their own future, free of U.S. interference.

(CNN) —

The United States and other countries are “getting close” to an interim deal with Iran that would prevent its nuclear program “from advancing, and roll it back” in key areas, a senior administration official said Friday.

Such a deal would “extend the breakout time” that Iran would need to achieve a nuclear weapon and “shorten the time to notice if they tried,” the official told reporters on the condition of not being identified.

The proposed deal – covering every aspect of Iran’s nuclear program, including uranium enrichment, uranium stockpiles and all nuclear facilities including military ones – would be completed during the next round of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, though difficult issues remain, the official said.

“We are going to work very hard next week, the official said. “I don’t know if we’ll reach an agreement. I think it is quite possible that we can. But there’s still tough issues to negotiate.”

The United States, along with the four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany – the so-called P5+1 – came close to a deal during talks with Iran last week in Geneva, but the discussions ended with both sides blaming each other for the lack of an agreement.

The P5+1 is “completely and totally unified” on the current outlines of the proposed deal, the official said.

The official warned against the imposition of further sanctions, which members of Congress have suggested.

“Further sanctions now threaten our good faith not just for Iran but for our P5+1 partners,” the official said.

Under the plan, sanctions relief “way south” of one proposed figure of $10 billion would be “metered out over the six months of an interim agreement to ensure compliance.”

Israel and the United States “may not see eye to eye on this tactically but are absolutely in agreement that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon,” the official said.

News of the development came a day after President Barack Obama said additional sanctions targeting Iran’s disputed nuclear program could undermine international progress already made on the issue.

“If we’re serious about pursuing diplomacy, then there’s no need for us to add new sanctions on top of the sanctions that are already very effective, and that brought them to the table in the first place,” Obama told reporters Thursday at the White House.

He said he would like to see if a “short-term, phase-one deal” with Iran can be put in place in the near term that requires Tehran to freeze aspects of its nuclear program while the international community negotiates a more comprehensive long-term deal.

U.S. renews ‘79 state of emergency with Iran

His remarks came amid a growing call in Congress for tighter sanctions to get Iran to agree to a deal that would stop what U.S. officials have said is its march toward a nuclear weapon.

“If it turns out six months from now that they’re not serious” about the agreement, “we can dial those sanctions right back up,” Obama said, noting that the economic penalties have hurt Iran’s economy.

Obama’s comments came the same day the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, released a report saying Iran had halted the expansion of a majority of its uranium enrichment capacity.

Russia’s foreign minister said Saturday that a deal with Iran on its nuclear program is close, warning the opportunity to bring about an end to a decade-long standoff must not be passed up.

USA TODAY

Julian Assange is lingering in Ecuador%27s embassy in London

Snowden has said he is hiding out in Hong Kong

Snowden has produced no information that U.S. programs were acting outside the law

LONDON — Could Edward Snowden pull a Julian Assange?

Snowden, the self-outed leaker of U.S. spying programs who says he is hiding out in Hong Kong, has expressed an interest in the news media to seek political asylum in Iceland.

But Iceland says he is missing a key element.

""The main stipulation for seeking asylum in Iceland would be that the person must be in Iceland to start the process,"" said Johannes Tomasson, the chief spokesman for Iceland's Ministry of Interior in Reykjavik. ""That would be the ground rule No. 1.""

WikiLeaks founder Assange, who also made public reams of U.S. classified information, lost his attempt in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face rape charges. Apparently unable to flee the country, he ran to the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has remained for nearly a year.

He has asked for political asylum, which was granted, and Ecuador says the Australian native can remain in its embassy for as long as he wishes.

Quito granted Assange safe harbor on the grounds that were he to be extradited to Sweden he would swiftly be passed on to authorities in the U.S. who want him to face allegations he leaked tens of thousands of government cables in violation of the law.

Ecuador, whose president Rafael Correa is a leftist and ally of former Venezuela anti-American president Hugo Chavez, said the U.S. prosecution of Assange represents wrongful persecution for his political views, a justification for granting someone political asylum. The United Kingdom says he violated his bail by fleeing to an embassy and will be arrested and sent to Sweden if he leaves the building.

So Assange lingers on the United Kingdom's embassy row, at an estimated cost so far of around $5 million to Scotland Yard.

Pressed on whether there could ever be a scenario where Snowden could walk into an Icelandic embassy in Hong Kong or elsewhere and receive a degree of protection while applying for asylum, Tomasson conceded that advice or consultation could be sought that fell outside the asylum-application process.

But he wouldn't comment on the legal status of the person seeking such advice or consultation. In other words, he couldn't say whether Snowden would be on base while trying to get to base.

""The main rule is that the application starts when the person is in Iceland, "" Tomasson said. ""Anything beyond that would just be speculation.""

Iceland has a reputation for providing sanctuary to others. In 2005, Iceland offered citizenship to chess champion Bobby Fischer, who was wanted in the USA on charges of breaking international law by playing a chess match in Yugoslavia in 1992 when it was under sanction for atrocities.

Assange's Wikileaks has enjoyed legal protection in Iceland, and WikiLeaks says it is prepared to help Snowden.

Its spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said he wasn't entirely certain what tools would be available to the organization to come to the aid of a fellow outer of classified information.

Assange did not work for any government whose secrets he is accused of publishing illegally and to the detriment of operations trying to prevent America's enemies from attacking it. Snowden was, however. Wikileaks says what Snowden alleges he did amounts to ""whistle-blowing,"" a term generally regarded as the making public of illegal actions by the government.

Yet so far, Snowden has produced no information that the U.S. surveillance programs were acting outside the law. The Obama administration says the programs were legal, under the supervision of the U.S. court system and monitored by intelligence committees in Congress whose members have said the programs prevented terror attacks against Americans.

""We believe he (Snowden) is an important whistle-blower,"" Hrafnsson said.

Hrafnsson said that WikiLeaks is not in direct contact with the former CIA computer expert who when he fled was working for Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm that handles government work. He declined to comment on whether WikiLeaks has staff members in Hong Kong that could be put at Snowden's disposal, saying only, ""We are of course willing to assist in any way possible.""

He Is An Editorial Writer Specializing In Foreign Affairs', 'Writes A Biweekly Column That Appears In Print On Mondays.']",Jackson Diehl: Wading into the Middle East morass,"On his second day in office in 2009, Barack Obama launched an ambitious effort to broker peace in the Middle East, ignoring warnings that neither Israelis nor Palestinians were ready for a deal. He was badly burned. Despite the appointment of former senator George Mitchell as an envoy and plenty of direct presidential involvement, the initiative flopped. Israelis and Palestinians never began substantial negotiations, and Obama’s first term ended with another mini-war in the Gaza Strip.

Four years later, the diplomatic landscape looks even more forbidding. Gaza remains firmly in the possession of the Hamas movement, which has not budged from its refusal to recognize Israel. The Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas appears to be crumbling, with Abbas himself contemplating retirement. An election this month in Israel appears likely to create one of most nationalist governments in the country’s history, one in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — regarded in the White House as a serious obstacle to any peace process — may represent the dovish left wing.

Yet if Obama were to listen to his European counterparts, Arab leaders and even his incoming secretary of state, he would, once again, make the “peace process” a top priority in his second term. The puzzling but persistent illogic behind this is worth deconstructing.

In Washington, some of the loudest calls for Obama’s reengagement come from the “realist” foreign policy camp, populated by figures such as former national security advisers Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft — and former senator Chuck Hagel, whom Obama is considering for defense secretary. These folks opposed the war in Iraq, and they reject U.S. intervention in Syria or military action against Iran’s nuclear program. They have been arguing for years that it is time for the United States to recognize limits to its power.

When it comes to Israel, however, the realists assume boundless U.S. strength. If only he chooses to do so, they argue, Obama could join with U.S. allies or the U.N Security Council in imposing a two-state solution on the Israelis and Palestinians, like it or not. The supposition seems to be that a United States too weak to force Bashar al-Assad out of Syria can compel Israel’s advanced democracy and the leaderless Palestinians to accept compromises they have resisted for decades.

There’s nothing wrong with the realists’ goal. Though often accused of being anti-Israel, Brzezinski and Scowcroft have proposed parameters for a Palestinian state close to those embraced by previous Israeli governments. Their solution is eminently logical; it’s the means of getting there that beggar belief. Obama’s first term was proof: The president proved unable even to force Israel to freeze settlements, or oblige the Palestinian Authority to negotiate — much less dictate a deal.

European governments mostly realized long ago that no U.S. administration would or could strong-arm the two sides. Yet they cling to another dogma, one that I suspect is shared by Secretary of State-to-be John Kerry: that an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is the key to stabilizing the broader Middle East, from Morocco to Iraq. It’s an idea nourished by old and new Arab rulers across the region, from Egypt’s new Islamist president to the kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, who are eager to divert U.S. attention from their own troubles.

If Palestinian statehood is so crucial, then it must be at the center of U.S. foreign policy, regardless of whether the time is ripe. But is it? As Egypt polarizes between secular and Islamist camps, and Syria’s vicious war pits Sunni Muslims against Alawites and their Shiite allies, it seems clear that the region’s biggest conflicts are those of Arabs against Arabs. But Western governments are at a loss over what to do about these battles. For the Israelis and Palestinians there is, at least, a well-known formula: conferences to be arranged, shuttles between capitals, dickering over conditions and pre-conditions.

All this is not to argue that Obama should ignore the Israelis and Palestinians or abandon the cause of Palestinian statehood, which in the long run will be a building block of a modernized Middle East. U.S. neglect could be taken as license by Israeli nationalists to take steps to obstruct that future state; it could also prompt Palestinians to embrace more provocative measures, from firing more missiles from Gaza at Israeli cities to inciting a new uprising in the West Bank.

But what’s needed is a concerted but low-key policy, one that aims at creating conditions for a long-term solution but does not pretend that it can be delivered in the next year or two. Obama should encourage Israel’s new government to take palliative steps to ease movement and promote development in the West Bank; he should press Egypt’s ruling Islamists to exert a moderating influence over Hamas. Above all, he should accept the lesson of his first term: that making Middle East peace a presidential priority will not make it happen.

A number of senators, from both sides of aisle, appear to be pushing sanctions as a contingency plan in case the agreement on Iran's nuclear program falters. But some may not be willing to wait -- presenting a problem for the Obama administration, since the deal signed with Iran and five other nations guarantees no new sanctions for six months.

If the Senate gets impatient and plows ahead with new legislation, Obama could be forced to veto -- and risk being overridden.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was among those calling for the pursuit of additional sanctions now, arguing that the interim deal does little to take Iran off the nuclear course.

""There is now an even more urgent need for Congress to increase sanctions until Iran completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities,"" Rubio said.

More On This...

Other senators want to continue to prepare sanctions legislation, but build into it a six-month window to let the current track play out.

""I expect that the forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the Senate will provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before imposing new sanctions on Iran, but will at the same time be immediately available should the talks falter or Iran fail to implement or breach the interim agreement,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said in a statement.

The deal reached over the weekend would ease roughly $7 billion worth of sanctions. In exchange, Iran would suspend parts of its nuclear program while diplomats try to work out a longer-term deal.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Iran was celebrating because its deal with the U.S. and the five other world powers allows it to continue to enrich uranium while getting billions in crippling sanctions lifted.

""They're spiking the ball in the end zone,"" Corker said.

He also said his greatest concern was that the Obama administration wouldn't follow through on the terms of the deal -- including daily inspections on Iran's nuclear facilities and ensuring that the country sticks to new thresholds for nuclear enrichment -- below levels toward building a nuclear weapon.

He also repeatedly said he didn't want the interim deal to ""become the norm"" and suggested Congress is ready to reinstate sanctions and impose more.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also said Sunday that he'll continue to work with colleagues ""to keep the pressure on the Iranian regime, including by action on additional sanctions.""

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, offered what appears to be some of the most unequivocal support for the deal.

""I support the agreement ... which I believe is a significant step toward solving one of the most difficult security challenges facing the world today,"" she said, while also expressing caution. ""By any standard, this agreement is a giant step forward and should not be undermined by additional sanctions at this time."""

Their commander had been killed and beheaded by an Al Qaeda-linked group a month earlier, the rebels said. Now these surviving FSA fighters were hiding here near the Turkish border.

Such mainstream rebel groups, formed to bring down the government of President Bashar Assad, increasingly find themselves in a battle against a different foe.

Walid Shawkan, the new commander of the displaced group, said fighters with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria attacked his men in the town of Dana after a dispute over weapons. The Islamists seized the arms and declared the fighters from the Hamza Lion of God brigade to be apostates.

“They are not coming to fight the regime,” Shawkan said. “They are coming to fight us. We’re going to fight them first and then the regime.”

As the third year of the Syrian conflict drags on, the ambitions of extremist Islamic groups are growing. The presence of those militants has played an important role in the U.S. debate over the Obama administration’s plan to launch missile strikes against Syria to punish the government for its suspected use of chemical weapons. Some opponents say it puts the U.S. squarely on the side of groups aligned with Al Qaeda.

When the Islamist fighters emerged last year, many in the Syrian opposition accepted their help while also predicting a post-Assad battle with them because their vision for the country was deeply at odds with that of the mainstream rebels. This year, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria publicly broke with Al Nusra Front, which had been the main Islamist and Al Qaeda-linked group in the country.

Since then, the Islamic State, which has more foreign fighters than other such groups, has grown more confrontational toward some of the rebel militias. Consequently, it seems that the battle with the Islamic State won’t wait.

In July, a senior FSA commander, Kamal Hamami, was shot and killed by the Islamic State in what the Supreme Military Council, the nominal head of the FSA, called an assassination. At the time, Col. Qassim Saad Eddine, spokesman for the council, said a member of the Al Qaeda-linked group had called him and threatened to kill all 30 council members.

The Islamic State has since routed three FSA groups from their northern communities — Jarabulus, Dana and, most recently, Raqqah province — part of its practice of establishing itself in areas already controlled by the opposition.

“They have opened a new front line for us; they work for the regime because they have distracted us from our fight against the regime,” said Ibrahim Hanano, commander of the Martyrs of Dignity’s Armor militia, which had given the Dana group refuge.

The emergence of the Islamist forces has also hurt the mainstream rebels by making the U.S. and other Western powers worry that if they provide military aid it could end up in the hands of terrorists.

Had it not been for the extremists in Syria “cutting off heads,” Saad Eddine said, the rebels would have been given weapons long ago.

In making its case for missile strikes, Obama administration officials have argued that the Islamist militants’ range and influence are limited.

“The opposition has increasingly become more defined by its moderation, more defined by the breadth of its membership and more defined by its adherence to some ... democratic process,” Secretary of State John F. Kerry told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week.

In an attempt to ensure Western military support, the Supreme Military Council is forming what it bills as a professional and secular opposition army. Fighting groups are being divided into battalions that are numbered rather than given Islamic names.

Yet even as they seek to distance themselves from the Islamic State, mainstream rebel groups face a complex military landscape: the Islamic State has taken part in some of the biggest victories by the opposition, including the capture of the Mannagh air base near the Turkish border and advances in Latakia province.

Efforts by the FSA leadership to turn rebel groups against the Islamic State — akin to the Awakening movement spearheaded by the U.S. in Iraq — would probably fail in Syria, said Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a Shillman-Ginsburg fellow at the Middle East Forum and a columnist at Jihadology.net, who tracks the group online.

“It’s just so much more fragmented and complicated than what happened in Iraq,” Al-Tamimi said. “It would be hard to coordinate a unified Awakening movement against them, especially as long as the regime is around.”

Some rebel leaders gladly fight side by side with the Al Qaeda-linked figures.

“Our position is that our only enemy is the regime,” Col. Abduljabbar Aqidi, head of the Aleppo Military Council, said recently at his headquarters. He said he thought the differences between the two groups could be resolved through dialogue.

After several rebel groups, including the Islamic State, seized the air base, Aqidi stood in front of a damaged helicopter there. To his left was a commander of the Islamist group, and Aqidi thanked the “immigrants” for helping liberate the base.

The Al Qaeda-linked group, meanwhile, has been clear that its goal is to establish an Islamic state, “not a sectarian, nationalistic or ethnic” one, a group spokesman said in response to written questions.

When Al Nusra Front entered the conflict last year, the mainly Syrian fighting force began dabbling in social services: restoring water and electricity and providing flour to bakeries.

The hearts-and-minds campaign waged by the Islamic State — whose members come from Tunisia, Chechnya, Libya and Saudi Arabia, among other places — is far more rudimentary.

At the intersection of three narrow streets in an Aleppo neighborhood, Islamic State member Abu Waqas Tunisi held up a knife in front of a rapt crowd of children. Behind him hung a mass of black Al Qaeda flags along with colorful balloons and beach balls.

“Where’s the cantaloupe?” asked Tunisi. “Whoever finishes the cantaloupe first will get a prize.”

Two young boys volunteered for the melon-eating contest and soon their faces were covered with fruit as religious songs played loudly on scratchy speakers.

“Show your prize to the people,” Tunisi instructed the winner, who was holding a paddle. “What do you say to the Islamic State?”

“May God protect you,” the boy said.

Advertisement

“And what else?”

The boy paused for a few moments, fingering his prize, then said hesitantly, “And ... and God make you victorious.”

Advertisement

“The Islamic State is going to start here and you will be part of it,” Tunisi said.

A few weeks later, the group held a similar event at a square in Dana, where more than a month earlier protesters had called for their ouster and the town’s FSA group was banished.

Though the Islamic State uses religion as the basis of its outreach — in addition to toy drives, it regularly holds Koran memorization contests — the FSA council is trying to move in the other direction, toward a secular army that world powers can support.

On a recent Sunday, Saad Eddine met with more than a dozen Syrian military defectors to record a video statement announcing the formation of three battalions under the council’s command.

When he finished, several officers instinctively yelled out, “God is great!”

“No, no, none of that,” Saad Eddine said. “Let’s start again.”

Advertisement

Later he said, “In any army there isn’t all this [God is great] or Koranic verses. We don’t insert religion into politics and the military.”

Months ago, several brigades in Aleppo’s western neighborhoods joined together to form a moderate Islamic coalition to counter the extremist groups.

A commander, who didn’t want his name published to avoid problems with the Islamic State, said the extremists were more violent. Though other FSA groups had clashed with them, so far his group hadn’t, he said.

For now, he said, the two sides were working together.

“I don’t like to think about what comes after because it hurts my head,” he said, but added, “The people who rose up to oust Bashar have the ability to oust any other Bashars who come after.”

(CNN) —

Russians and Americans have been duking it out in the Twitter world over who’s scoring more points in high-stakes diplomatic wrangling over Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama or Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted Thursday: “Three days ago there seemed no diplomatic way to hold Assad accountable. Threat of U.S. action finally brought Russia to the table.”

In her tweet, Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia’s English-language television network RT, quipped: “If the Russian proposal on Syria works, Obama, as an honest man, has to give his Nobel Prize to Putin.”

Taking Syria’s chemical weapons out of government control and preventing another horrendous attack on civilians is too serious an issue to reduce to political one-upmanship.

But after Putin’s bombshell opinion piece in the New York Times in which, among other things, he takes America to task for an “alarming” pattern of intervening in the internal conflicts of foreign countries, it’s obvious something has shifted.

“It absolutely is a diplomatic win by Putin right now,” said Fiona Hill, expert on Putin and director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution.

“If we think about this as judo, which is of course Mr. Putin’s favorite sport, this is just one set of moves,” she said. “And right now, he’s managed to get Obama off the mat, at least, and get the terms set down that play to his advantage.”

Putin’s comments cause a fuss

Putin stopped Obama’s drive for military action against Syria in its tracks this week as Russia’s plan to put Syria’s chemical weapons under international control pushes the action to the United Nations, just where Putin wants it.

Russia has veto power in the U.N. Security Council, and as Hill noted, it’s an “arena that they’re really very skilled at, which is usually blocking other people from getting resolutions or moving forward.”

Putin’s op-ed is not going down lightly in Washington. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up.

“Mr. Putin’s personality has been widely demonized in the Western world, so anything that comes from Mr. Putin will be met not only with skepticism but a lot of people will reject just out of hand anything that Mr. Putin will say,” said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

“However, in this particular situation, when so many people are confused in the United States, in Europe, including in the political classes of Western countries, the arguments that Putin is making so clearly could be used in the domestic debate,” he added.

Analysis: Is Obama a winner or loser on Syria?

Trenin thinks Putin “is trying to insert himself and the Russian position into the debate that’s now ongoing on Capitol Hill, within the U.S. more broadly, in the European countries. He does not want to leave the field to Westerners alone. He wants to have a voice in that discussion.”

Arguments Putin presents in his op-ed struck a chord with some in Washington, even if they dislike him.

One example: “Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government.”

Other points, like his swipe at Obama’s comment this week trumpeting American “exceptionalism,” are bound to irritate some of the Americans Putin is trying to sway.

Sen. James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, said Thursday that “Putin was lecturing to the United States, and I could hear (Ronald) Reagan turning over in his grave as this was going on.”

Some Russians claim that Obama “owes” Putin for getting him out of a bind. Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted tartly: “Obama should be ‘for’ Russia’s plan with two hands. It gives him a chance not to start a new war, not lose in the Congress, and not become another Bush,” referring to his predecessor.

Hill said Putin did do Obama a favor.

“For Putin, being the old KGB guy, having someone owe him something is always to his advantage,” she said.

“But this is more about a win for Russia here. Russia gets an imminent U.S. strike off the table for a while,” Hill said.

The White House is trying to throw the ball back to Putin, cautioning that his chemical weapons proposal will boomerang if it doesn’t work.

Putin “now owns this. He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver,” a senior White House official told CNN.

Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and former deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, tweeted: “If Kerry-Lavrov meeting exposes Russian proposal as sham, it will strengthen Obama’s hand with Congress, assuring what Putin hopes to stop.”

The administration’s efforts at downplaying may also stem, in part, from a desire to manage expectations, since Snowden may continue to elude U.S. custody. But it’s clear that in the last several days, the administration has sought to de-escalate confrontations over his flight.

Snowden fled Hong Kong on Sunday to avoid a U.S. extradition request and landed in Russia. Since then, he has apparently been in a transit lounge at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport while seeking asylum in Ecuador.

At the beginning of the week, administration officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, were condemning Russia, China and Ecuador as repressive governments, comments that provoked pique, especially in Moscow.

Now, even as American officials continue their effort to get Snowden, Obama has made it clear that the administration wants to limit damage to its relationship with China, its largest trading partner, and Russia, which has leverage over Washington on the Syrian civil war, nuclear arms talks, the Iranian nuclear program and other matters.

U.S. officials also indicated that they would move carefully in trying to dissuade Ecuador from granting Snowden’s asylum request.

The Chinese and Russians appear to be of a similar mind. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants a scheduled September meeting of the Group of 20 nations to underscore Russia’s importance in global affairs, has been eager to wind down the controversy. He made that clear Tuesday, saying the Snowden issue was “like shearing a pig — lots of screeching but little wool.”

The Chinese showed their desire to put the issue behind them by signaling to Hong Kong authorities their wish that Snowden be allowed to leave for Moscow.

“China took a strategic approach … by getting rid of the problem,” said Yukon Huang, a China specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

The U.S. move to shift the issue onto a legal track and further away from big-power politics is consistent with the way Washington tries to handle spy cases — with minimal publicity and private diplomacy — experts noted.

Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, made disclosures about large-scale surveillance programs directed both at foreigners and American citizens that have embarrassed the administration. The surveillance of telephone records and the Internet have drawn condemnations from governments, including China’s and Russia’s, that Washington frequently criticizes for authoritarian tactics and human rights abuses.

Obama said he would like to see Snowden, who faces three felony counts in the United States, in custody. But at a news conference in Senegal, where the president began a three-nation Africa visit, he sought to portray the pursuit of the fugitive as a routine law enforcement issue, far less important than the business the administration is trying to conduct with the two countries Snowden has visited so far in his flight.

In response to a question, Obama said he had not sought to contact Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping personally on the issue because “I shouldn’t have to.”

“We’ve got a whole lot of business that we do with China and Russia,” he said. “I’m not going to have one case of a suspect who we’re trying to extradite suddenly being elevated to the point where I’ve got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues, simply to get a guy extradited.”

Advertisement

The case was of a kind that is “routinely dealt with between law enforcement officials in various countries,” he said. “This is not exceptional from a legal perspective.”

He waved off a question about whether he intended to try to block Snowden’s departure from Moscow, saying, “I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.”

Advertisement

Obama also suggested that the U.S. has little to fear from further disclosures by Snowden.

“In terms of U.S. interests, the damage was done with respect to the initial leaks,” he said. “We don’t yet know what other documents he may try to dribble out there,” but “on the other hand, what I’m also confident about is that the way we run these programs abides by the laws.”

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials say they assume that Russian and Chinese intelligence services have already gotten everything Snowden took from the NSA.

“Everything he had in his head and on devices is absolutely compromised,” one former senior counterintelligence official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters.

“There is a well-established and relatively active liaison between the Russian and Chinese intelligence services, to include training of intel officers. So I’m sure this is a cooperative effort,” the former official said.

Russia, though now with only a shadow of the power it wielded in Soviet days, has a unique ability to obstruct American strategic goals. And the White House is preparing for a potentially important Obama trip to Russia in September and strategic discussions with top Chinese officials in Washington in less than two weeks.

“No one has an interest in blowing the Russia meetings up over Snowden,” said Andrew Weiss, a former Russia advisor to President Clinton who is now with the Carnegie Endowment.

The administration has far less to fear from any confrontation with Ecuador. But conflict with the left-leaning regime in Quito, which relishes a chance to tweak Washington, could draw unwanted attention, and officials signaled that they hoped to keep the discussion muted.

Ecuadorean officials began Thursday defiantly, saying they were withdrawing from a 2-decade-old trade pact with the United States because it left them vulnerable to U.S. “blackmail” as they consider whether to grant Snowden’s asylum request. In fact, the program is likely to lapse anyway for reasons unrelated to the Snowden case.

State Department officials have warned that granting asylum for Snowden would have a “grave impact” on relations. But they add that they hope to avoid a dispute since the United States is Ecuador’s largest trading partner and accounts for 35% of its trade.

“We don’t want this issue to negatively impact our relations,” said Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman.

In a related development Thursday, Britain’s Guardian newspaper, which has published most of Snowden’s disclosures, reported that the NSA for several years had been collecting so-called Internet metadata of foreigners and Americans alike, including the “to” and “from” fields in email and IP addresses of senders that can reveal location.

The Obama administration halted the program in 2011 “for operational and resource reasons, and [it] has not been restarted,” Shawn Turner, spokesman for the national intelligence director, said in an email. A U.S. intelligence official said the program had been stopped because it wasn’t producing much.

And you'll never believe who was behind it!!



GRETCHEN CARLSON (10/28/2013): New mainstream media outrage now over the Benghazi terror attack. But it's certainly not new for you out there, our viewers. Because the wrenching report on 60 Minutes last night was filled with information Fox uncovered months ago. STEVE DOOCY (10/28/2013): I think it's great that mainstream media, finally catching up. CBS did this story on Benghazi, and I see criticism from the left, where they're all, ""you guys are covering a phony scandal"". 60 Minutes doesn't cover phony scandals.

(audience laughter and applause)

Also, CBS should've checked with someone else, because Morgan Jones's story turned out to be totally fake. Including his name, which is not Morgan Jones, but Dylan Davies, which actually sounds even more fake. In fact, in his incident report to his employer, Davies wrote that ""he spent most of that night at his Benghazi beach-side villa"", nowhere near the embassy. Evidently, the guy he hit in the face with the butt of his rifle that night was a cabana boy. And God, I hope it was his rifle!

Now CBS knew Davies had lied to his employer, but believed the heroic version he told them, because their sources led them to believe that Davies' FBI report was ""in sync"" with what he told 60 Minutes.

Or he might have told the FBI that he was the lead singer of 'N Sync, it's not clear. Because later the New York Times checked with the FBI, and Davies' FBI testimony is not what he told 60 Minutes, so ""CBS News quickly checked its own FBI sources ... and learned ... what Mr. Davies had told the FBI differed from what he told us.'""

So, CBS fact-checked the story, but when it turned out to be wrong, they fact-checked it for realz, y'all. (audience laughter)

And, on last night's the 60 Minutes, Lara Logan addressed the controversy head on, at the very top of the last minute of the show.



LARA LOGAN (11/10/2013): We end our broadcast tonight with a correction, on a story we reported October 27th. ... We realized we had been misled, and it was a mistake to include him in our report. For that, we are very sorry. The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth. And the truth is, we made a mistake.

You see, as you well know but I will repeat as often as possible, Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State during the Benghazi attacks. I mean, that's her official photo.

Ergo, quid pro quo, amicus brief, she is to blame. And now she's so hungry for power in 2016, that she somehow convinced 60 Minutes to air this false Benghazi apology to discredit their investigation.

And we here at The Colbert Report have now found an eyewitness with startling new details concerning the night of the tragic CBS-Benghazi apology. Jim?

STEPHEN COLBERT: I understand you were a college intern at 60 Minutes.

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes.

STEPHEN COLBERT: And for your own safety, you are using an alias tonight. What is that?

PONCHO DENEWS: Poncho Denews.

STEPHEN COLBERT: Now, Poncho, you were interning the night all hell broke loose at 60 Minutes.

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes, Stephen, I was definitely there that night because I'm an actual human witness.

STEPHEN COLBERT: Tell us what happened, Poncho.

PONCHO DENEWS: Well, I was coming back from getting chewing tobacco for Leslie Stahl, when I heard explosions of shouting.

STEPHEN COLBERT: And what did you do next?

PONCHO DENEWS: I ran towards it. I scaled the 30-foot wall surrounding the newsroom. Once I landed, a shadowy figure ran towards me, so I knocked him out with the butt of my harpoon gun.

STEPHEN COLBERT: And who was that?

PONCHO DENEWS: Turns out it was Morley Safer. But, then I turned around, and I saw... I saw....

STEPHEN COLBERT: Who did you see?

PONCHO DENEWS: It was Hillary Clinton and her band of thugs! She was swinging a bike chain and yelling, ""We're here to kill the story! Who wants to eat some chain?"" (audience laughter and applause) Then she pistol-whipped Morley Safer. Which was cruel, since he was already unconscious.

STEPHEN COLBERT: So it was Hillary Clinton who made CBS apologize.

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes!

STEPHEN COLBERT: I knew it! Anything else?

PONCHO DENEWS: Yes, Stephen, I have one more exclusive. I'm not really 60 Minutes intern Poncho Denews. I'm... (takes off facial hair) Charlie Skinner!

Of Atlantis Cable News channel, as profiled in the HBO documentary The Newsroom! (wild audience laughter and applause) Gotcha!!

STEPHEN COLBERT: What?! Where'd that college intern go??

CHARLIE SKINNER: There never was any intern, Stephen! I did it to prove a point! That as journalists, we are the gatekeepers of truth! We separate right from wrong, fact from fiction, delicates from permanent press! I recall a man who said, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" That man was Spider-Man's uncle. And now... he's dead! The public needs us to be the watchdogs of democracy. We have a responsibility to criticize our leaders without reproach, report national secrets without fear of imprisonment. If we violate this contract, this public trust....

STEPHEN COLBERT: How much longer does this go?

CHARLIE SKINNER: Almost done. Then we will have a puppet press of hearsay and innuendo and speculation, hyperbole, and nonsense! Ding dong! Who is it? It's Domino's. But more importantly, it's the truth!! (wild audience laughter and applause) Delivered hot and crusty! Or your money back! That's a guarantee we make America every night, otherwise the world is just crazy bread.

STEPHEN COLBERT: Technically, crazy bread is Little Caesar's.

CHARLIE SKINNER: It's called poetic license, goddamnit!

STEPHEN COLBERT: You're right, The Newsroom's Charlie Skinner. Now if you'll excuse me, there's something I have to do.

We end our this part of the show with a correction. In our report tonight, a man named Poncho Denews claimed he was a 60 Minutes intern, and we believed him because he had an ID lanyard. (audience laughter)

Following the report, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the TV Guide all reported that he was actually the actor Sam Waterston, star of The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean. (wild audience laughter) Look it up, look it up.

We checked with our sources at IMDB, and it turns out we made a mistake. We should not have used him in our report. And for that, we're very sorry. The most important thing to everyone here at The Colbert Report is the truth. And the truth is, it's somebody else's fault. We'll be right back."

Al-Shabab is a Somali Islamic extremist group

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — A United States military strike hit a vehicle carrying senior members of an al-Qaeda-linked militant group in Somalia on Monday, killing at least two people including the group's top explosives expert, a militant and a government intelligence official said.

A senior United States military official says there was a U.S. counterterrorism strike against a terrorist target in Somalia Monday but would give no further details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no authorization to discuss the strike publicly.

An al-Shabab member who gave his name as Abu Mohamed said one of those killed was al-Shabab's top explosives expert, known as Anta. He said a drone fired at the car in Somalia's Middle Juba region. It was not clear how Mohamed would know it was a drone strike, except that he said no attack helicopters were seen.

A Somali intelligence official in Mogadishu said the attack occurred as al-Shabab members went to intervene in a clan dispute. The official insisted on anonymity because he is not authorized to share intelligence.

Earlier this month, United States Navy SEALs raided a coastal Somali town to take down a Kenyan al-Shabab member. The SEALs withdrew before capturing or killing their target. The target of that attack — Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir, known as Ikrima — was identified as the lead planner of a plot by al-Shabab to attack Kenya's parliament building and the United Nations office in Nairobi in 2011 and 2012.

If a drone strike in southern Somalia is confirmed, it will add evidence of the increasing importance Western powers view the counterterrorism operations in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia. The East African nation has seen several military attacks — often reported as drone strikes — in recent years.

Al-Shabab militants attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, in neighboring Kenya, on Sept. 21 with guns and grenades, killing at least 67 people. Al-Shabab promised more attacks on Kenyan soil unless Kenya withdraws its troops from Somalia."

(CNN) —

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made his case Thursday to the American people and the world for “a constructive approach” to contentious issues including his nation’s nuclear program, arguing that failing to engage “leads to everyone’s loss.”

“We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart,” Rouhani said in an op-ed published Thursday evening on the Washington Post’s website.

It’s not the first time a leader from a country often at odds with the United States has used its newspapers to convey his or her views. Just last week, for instance, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued against international military intervention in Syria and jabbed his U.S. counterpart for saying Americans should consider themselves “exceptional” – a remark that quickly elicited derision from across the U.S. political spectrum.

But Rouhani’s tone differed from Putin’s, echoing the theme of “prudence and hope” and the promise of more positive engagement with the rest of the world that helped propel him to an election win in June.

“To move beyond impasses, … we need to aim higher,” he said. “Rather than focusing on how to prevent things from getting worse, we need to think – and talk – about how to make things better.”

Contending “the age of blood feuds” and the idea of diplomacy as a “zero-sum game” no longer apply in a “changed” world, Rouhani said leaders should engage each other “on the basis of equal footing and mutual respect.”

“My approach to foreign policy seeks to resolve … issues by addressing their underlying causes,” he said. “We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart.”

Chief among those issues, for Iran, is its nuclear program. Iranian officials have insisted its aim is peaceful and for energy purposes only, but skeptical U.S., Israeli and other officials accuse Tehran of working to develop nuclear weapons. Iran’s lack of openness on the issue and its perceived lack of cooperation with international nuclear authorities, have led to stringent international sanctions and increased tensions in the region.

In his opinion column Thursday, Rouhani sought to frame the debate over what he called “our peaceful nuclear energy program.” This program, he said, is tied into not only addressing Iran’s energy needs but also into establishing its place in the world.

“To us, mastering the atomic fuel cycle and generating nuclear power is as much about diversifying our energy resources as it is about who Iranians are as a nation, our demand for dignity and respect, and our consequent place in the world,” he said.

The Washington Post column appears to be part of a U.S.-targeted public relations initiative by Rouhani, coming a day after he talked with NBC News.

In that interview, Rouhani said, “We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb and we are not going to do so.”

Iran’s Rouhani: Diplomat’s touch, no pushover

There’s little dispute Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is Iran’s most powerful figure. Still, Rouhani said Thursday that he and his delegation will head to New York with the “full power and has complete authority” to make a deal with others on nuclear matters.

The Iranian president also talked about trading letters with Obama this summer, an exchange he called “positive and constructive.”

“It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,” Rouhani told NBC, according to video on the network’s website. “I believe the leaders in all countries could think in their national interests and that they should not be under the influence of (interest) groups.”

Rouhani’s Washington Post op-ed published a few hours after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry – also speaking in Washington – characterized some of the new Iranian president’s remarks as “very positive.”

Yet he offered his compliment with a caveat: “Everything needs to be put to the test, and we’ll see where we go.”

Iranian human rights activist freed

Kerry punted on a question of whether Rouhani and U.S. President Barack Obama will meet next week when both attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

Asked the same question Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said “there are currently no plans” for such a face-to-face meeting though he also didn’t rule it out.

And Carney did hint the United States is open to talks with Iran – with whom it has feuded regarding Iran’s nuclear program, a dispute that’s led to harsh international sanctions and raised the specter of war in the region – to “test” whether Tehran is sincere in its hope to improve its international standing.

“I think it’s fair to say that (Obama) believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the United States and our allies with regards to Iran,” Carney said. “And we hope that the Iranian government takes advantage of this opportunity.”

In fact, there were high-level talks Thursday – involving Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Zarif called the meeting “constructive,” saying it involved “satisfactory negotiations” on various issues such as Iran’s nuclear program, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Ban’s office also issued a positive statement on the meeting, saying the two “discussed Iran’s growing cooperation with the international community on a host of issues, including the nuclear file, as well the role Iran could play in promoting a political solution to the conflict in Syria.”

This cooperation has been spearheaded by Rouhani, himself a former nuclear negotiator who vowed during his campaign to try to reduce tensions between Iran and the outside world.

That includes expressing openness in talks on its nuclear program. The 64-year-old cleric, who is considered a moderate, said last month that as long as there are “negotiations without threats, the way for interaction is open.”

Washington and Paris say forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were behind the attack in which more than 1,400 are estimated to have been killed, and that they are considering air strikes to try to deter him from using such weapons again. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relevant countries should ""think thrice"" before acting and exercise ""extreme caution"". "" should return to the United Nations Security Council framework to seek consensus and appropriately handle the Syria issue,"" Wang told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in a telephone call late on Sunday night. China and the United States should take the lead in upholding the U.N. charter to ""preserve and protect the basic norms of international relations and oppose any use of chemical weapons"", Wang said, according to a statement on the Foreign Ministry's website. The remarks come after Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Barack Obama at a G20 summit in Russia on Friday that a military strike could not solve the problem and that a political solution was the correct way out. China has repeatedly called for an impartial investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors into the attack in Syria, and has warned against pre-judging the results. It has also said that whoever used chemical weapons had to be held accountable. U.N. inspectors are likely to hand in their report later this week while the U.S. Congress debates whether to allow limited strikes on Syria. French President Francois Hollande, increasingly under pressure at home and among European partners to seek a U.N. mandate before any military intervention in Syria, suggested on Saturday he could seek a resolution at the Security Council despite previous Russian and Chinese vetoes. Kerry said the White House is ""listening carefully"" to Hollande's comments, but that Obama had not made a decision. Chinese state media said on Monday Obama's ""all-guns-blazing campaign to lobby"" for armed intervention did not hold up and that a military strike on Syria would be a violation of international law. ""It is high time to let reason prevail over recklessness,"" the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary, which reflects official thinking. Apart from its Security Council veto, China has also been keen to show it is not taking sides and has urged the Syrian government to talk to the opposition and take steps to meet demands for political change. It has said a transitional government should be formed. (Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Paul Tait)"

Treisman: U.S. needs Russian support on some key international issues

In Russian, there is an old saying: ""An uninvited guest is worse than a Tatar,"" referring to the country's medieval invaders from the East.

Although Edward Snowden's lawyer calls him ""the most wanted man on the planet,"" it's clear that Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, would rather he were just about anywhere else.

After five weeks in Sheremetyevo Airport's transit zone, the NSA leaker was allowed to leave on Thursday under a grant of temporary asylum valid for one year. A taxi spirited him to an undisclosed Moscow location, where Putin's Federal Security Service will undoubtedly be watching him closely.

To some in the U.S., Snowden's Sheremetyevo escapade seems to have Putin written all over it. The Russian president, who once compared the U.S.'s behavior abroad to that of the Third Reich, seems to rarely miss an opportunity to score points at Washington's expense.

Yet the reality is that Putin did not seek out this problem, and now that his agents have presumably debriefed Snowden, he would much prefer for it to disappear.

Daniel Treisman

Snowden was -- and remains -- an uninvited guest. Russia's intelligence agencies did not lure the NSA contractor to Moscow. It is not even clear how much they will have learned from him. Russian intelligence must have known already that the NSA was comprehensively monitoring telephone and Internet traffic.

Putin, who has never shown a soft spot for whistle-blowers and civil libertarians, is certainly not sheltering Snowden on humanitarian grounds. As a former KGB colonel, he understands the U.S. intelligence community's desire to get the leaker back.

But Putin is stuck. He cannot extradite Snowden to the U.S. without looking subservient. At the same time, he has no real interest in further damaging relations with Washington.

That might seem strange given the angry rhetoric that regularly issues from Moscow, in particular from the Parliament, where Putin's United Russia party dominates. Just in December, Putin signed a bill banning the adoption of Russian orphans by Americans.

However, anti-Americanism has always been a complicated game for the Russian president. On the one hand, it plays well in the provinces. Since December 2011, when Moscow's boulevards erupted into protest, Putin has faced the most serious political challenge of his career. Having lost the support of sophisticated urbanites, his priority has been to shore up his provincial base.

One key strategy has been to appeal to more traditional and nationalist constituencies. Kremlin operatives attempt to discredit Putin's critics by portraying them as stooges for an interventionist Washington that seeks to interfere in Russian domestic life. In 2007, Putin compared his opponents to ""jackals,"" scrounging around outside foreign embassies for handouts.

Although exploiting xenophobia may seem crude, it works with some segments of the population. Putin wins widespread credit for standing up for Russia's rights and restoring the country's position in the world.

Still, while insisting on Russian sovereignty, Putin loses the aura of a skilled statesman if his policies provoke genuine crises. Behind the scenes, and even in public, he has sought accommodation on certain international issues. Putin, the anti-American in chief, personally faced down communist protesters to permit NATO to build a transit hub in the city of Ulyanovsk.

Some in Washington have urged President Obama to skip the G20 summit in St. Petersburg in September. Sen. Lindsey Graham even suggested boycotting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Putin would clearly like to avoid such snubs.

But were they to occur, he would cast them as yet another show of U.S. arrogance, a slap in the face not for him personally but for Russia. Assuming the leaders of Western European countries -- where many sympathize with Snowden -- do come to St. Petersburg, the final impression produced by Obama's empty chair might be less of Russian humiliation than of U.S. isolation.

For this and other reasons, the White House would probably also prefer to move beyond the Snowden issue. The U.S. public appears ambivalent at this point, uncomfortable about both Snowden's law-breaking and the scope of government snooping.

Yet the longer the issue remains in the public eye, the more embarrassing it is likely to become for the administration. For a U.S. attorney general to have to guarantee that a suspect would not be tortured if returned shows how much has changed over the past 12 years. The more officials turn out to have ""misspoken"" in denying existing surveillance programs, the lower trust in government is likely to sink.

At the same time, the U.S. has a broader agenda on which it needs to negotiate with Moscow. Syria continues to bleed. Although odds of a breakthrough are low, a joint U.S.-Russian peace conference is supposed to take place in Geneva this fall. The Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs remain urgent challenges. On these and other issues, Russia's U.N. Security Council seat makes it a crucial player.

Through 2014, as U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, the NATO transport route across Russian territory will remain important. If Secretary of State John Kerry's latest attempt to revive Middle East peace talks is to bear fruit, the U.S. will at least need to persuade Russia not to become a spoiler.

Finally, even on Snowden, the White House may not want to push the Russians too far. As Andrew Kuchins, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out, the U.S. could do worse than to have Snowden remain -- under tight control -- in Moscow.

If Putin honors his pledge to stop Snowden harming what Putin called his ""American partners,"" then at least further leaks will be prevented. Were the Russians in frustration to put their uninvited guest on a plane to Ecuador or Cuba, the next morning's newspapers might contain additional revelations."

China and Russia push back on U.S. criticism

Putin says Snowden is in a transit area - not technically in Russia

Edward Snowden%27s U.S. passport has been revoked

MOSCOW — The United States appeared no closer Tuesday to getting back fugitive Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who remains in Russia while trying to win third-country political asylum and protection from a U.S. extradition request on espionage charges.

Snowden, indicted for leaking classified National Security Agency information, remains in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport after fleeing Hong Kong on Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Snowden would not be handed over to the U.S. because the countries have no formal extradition treaty. Because Snowden is in a transit zone, he's not technically in Russia, Putin said.

While working for government security contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden, 30, exposed the NSA's massive, long-running Internet and telephone surveillance programs.



Russia and China — the latter of which also was unsympathetic to U.S. efforts to return Snowden after he fled from Hawaii to Hong Kong — have drawn sharp criticism from the Obama administration, further straining international relations.

China previously said it was concerned over Snowden's allegations that the U.S. had hacked into many of the country's Internet networks.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said despite the lack of an extradition treaty, there is ""clear legal basis to expel Mr. Snowden, based on the status of his travel documents and the pending charges against him.""



But Putin, while visiting Finland on Tuesday, said he would rather not intervene in the case and noted that trying to navigate a diplomatic resolution was problematic.

""I'd prefer not to deal with this issue at all. It's like shearing a pig — too much squeaking, too little wool,'' Putin said. The Russian president said Snowden was free to leave Russia. ""The sooner he chooses his final destination, the better it will be for us and him,"" Putin said.

Separately, a Chinese state newspaper praised Snowden for his decision to make public government surveillance programs, adding fresh pressure to increasingly strained U.S.-China relations. In a commentary, China's People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, lauded Snowden for ""tearing off Washington's sanctimonious mask.""

""In a sense, the U.S. has gone from a model of human rights to an eavesdropper on personal privacy, the manipulator of the centralized power over the international Internet, and the mad invader of other countries' networks,"" the People's Daily commentary said.

WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization that is financing Snowden's international travel and search for asylum, maintained Tuesday that Snowden had not been debriefed by either Chinese or Russian intelligence authorities.

""That is still the case, as far as I know,"" WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said, adding that Russian officials have ""made no request'' to interview Snowden about his knowledge of secret U.S. surveillance programs.

Hrafnsson declined to discuss Snowden's next move, though he said he was ""fairly optimistic'' that Ecuador would grant Snowden's asylum request.

Snowden, the former intelligence contractor sought by the United States on espionage charges, received a change of clothes and a copy of “Crime and Punishment” during a meeting with his lawyer on Wednesday, but still no clearance to enter Russia.

Mr. Snowden has applied for temporary asylum in Russia, and Russian news agencies had reported earlier on Wednesday that the Russian Federal Migration Service had issued a certificate confirming his application and permitting him to pass through Russian border control. A huge throng of reporters and camera crews gathered at the airport terminal in anticipation of Mr. Snowden’s departure.

But around 6 p.m., Anatoly Kucherena, a Russian lawyer assisting Mr. Snowden with his asylum request, emerged from the transit zone and said that the certificate had not been received. He did not cite a reason for the delay but said officials had informed him that Mr. Snowden’s situation “was not a standard process” and that the paperwork needed to allow him to depart the airport required more time.

Mr. Kucherena said he had met with Mr. Snowden and described him as being in good spirits, with plans to learn Russian. He said he had taken him the copy of the Dostoyevsky book."

President Obama, who announced Saturday that he would seek legislative backing for military action in response to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons, sought to raise the pressure on Congress as well as U.S. allies, warning that their reputations were at stake.

“My credibility’s not on the line. The international community’s credibility’s on the line. And America and Congress’ credibility’s on the line,” Obama said during a visit to Stockholm.

Administration officials have repeatedly compared Syrian President Bashar Assad to Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler, and said he needs to be deterred from using chemical weapons again.

On a 10-7 vote, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a resolution to authorize U.S. missile strikes. The committee chairman, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), said Congress should “make sure Assad understands he can’t just wait us out, use chemical weapons and face no consequences.”

TRANSCRIPT: Obama’s remarks on Syria

Several senators from both parties, including opponents of the resolution, predicted the Senate would approve it next week. Yet the Senate’s conflicted views were clear in the vote, which saw Democrats and Republicans on each side. Menendez and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) supported the resolution, while conservative Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) voted with liberal Tom Udall (D-N.M.) against it.

Serious doubts on U.S. military action were aired in a hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and other lawmakers repeatedly asked about the risks of U.S. involvement in Syria’s civil war, while Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) questioned why the United States should side with Syrian rebels when “radical Islamists” make up most of their forces.

Obama, meanwhile, insisted he was not alone in demanding a response to the alleged use of chemical weapons in the suburbs of Damascus on Aug. 21, but was joined by nations that signed treaties banning chemical weapons and by Congress, which ratified them. “I didn’t set a red line; the world set a red line” he said. “That wasn’t something I just kind of made up.”

The Senate committee’s resolution limits any U.S. mission to 90 days and prohibits the use of ground troops.

The resolution was amended to include language from McCain and Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) directing that the strike be used to “change the momentum on the battlefield” away from the Syrian government, which has had the edge for much of this year. The amendment said that it was necessary to pressure Assad to negotiate an end to the war.

Supporters hope that language will capture the votes of centrist lawmakers, as well as hawks. But it could drive away antiwar Democrats and anti-interventionist Republicans in the House, who have been insisting the strikes should not pull the United States deeper into another war.

The difficulty of winning votes in the House — particularly among majority Republicans — was clear at the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, faced mostly skeptical questions about their confidence in the intelligence about the use of chemical weapons, the nature of the Syrian opposition and the consequences of a strike.

The panel’s chairman, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), said the administration’s Syria policy “doesn’t build confidence” and that the House would make its own revisions to the authorization resolution.

In one combative exchange, Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) questioned why the administration had abandoned its caution on military action in Syria and was “pulling the trigger on a military response so quickly.” The administration, he said, has a credibility issue with the public “due to the unanswered questions surrounding the terrorist attack in Benghazi,” a reference to the attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in that Libyan city last Sept. 11 that killed four Americans, including the ambassador.

“Let’s draw the proper distinction here,” Kerry sternly responded. “We don’t deserve to drag this into yet another Benghazi discussion when the real issue here is whether or not the Congress is going to stand up for international norms with respect to dictators that have only been broken twice until Assad: Hitler and Saddam Hussein. And if we give license to somebody to continue that, shame on us.”

DOCUMENT: U.S. chemical weapons intelligence report

Strong statements in support of a resolution came from Reps. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), both of whom served in the military. Kinzinger displayed a photo of Syrian children to warn about the risk of further inaction.

“The day the United States does not act is not just the day that Bashar al Assad knows it’s open season for chemical weapons, but also the day Kim Jong Un knows that and, most ominously, the day that Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, spins his centrifuges into overdrive,” Cotton said.

In an interview, Kinzinger estimated there was only a 40% chance the House would pass a resolution, “maybe 50 if we’re lucky.”

Given the divide among Republicans, White House lobbying efforts appear to be centered on Democrats. Administration officials held separate phone briefings with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Progressive Caucus. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) sent a letter to Democrats seeking “further suggestions or ideas you may have as to what you can support” in a resolution.

Dempsey acknowledged that the risk of escalation can never be ruled out entirely. The military intends to limit U.S. involvement “in time and commitment,” he said. “That’s not to say I discount the risk of escalation, which I can never discount. But we’ve mitigated it as much as possible.”

Kerry portrayed the intervention as an issue of conscience for the world. He suggested that if the U.S. does not act, that will tell Assad: “Nobody cares. Gas your people. You do what you need to to stay in office.”

He compared the alleged sarin gas attack on the Damascus suburbs, which U.S. intelligence agencies concluded killed more than 1,400 people, to the slaughter of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.

Kerry also acknowledged that Arab countries had offered to pay for the U.S. military to oust Assad. “With respect to Arab countries offering to bears costs and to assess, the answer is profoundly yes,” he said. “That offer is on the table.”

Obama heads to St. Petersburg, Russia, on Thursday, where he will press world leaders to act. He did not say whether he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who remains an ally of Syria. “Do I hold out hope that Mr. Putin may change his position on some of these issues? I’m always hopeful,” he said.

Putin, in an interview with First Channel, a Russian federal television network, and the Associated Press, said he hoped to meet with Obama. He also said he had not ruled out backing a U.S.-led military operation in Syria if the Kremlin gets proof that Assad’s government carried out a poison gas attack.

But Putin also said it would be “completely ridiculous” for the Syrian army to use gas when it is winning on the battlefield. And he recalled erroneous American arguments about weapons of mass destruction that led to the Iraq war. “All these arguments turned out to be untenable,” he said. “Did we forget about that?”

“I think this is obviously one of those moments where North Korea needs to figure out where it’s heading and recognize that the United States of America is not engaging in belligerent and threatening behavior,” Kerry told NBC News.

Last month, an 85-year-old tourist from Palo Alto was buckled in his seat on a plane preparing to depart Pyongyang, North Korea, when a flight attendant pointed him out to two men in uniform. They promptly escorted him off the plane.

The man, Merrill Newman, a retired financial executive and Korean War veteran, has not been heard from since.

Newman was detained Oct. 26 at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport, but the case was initially kept secret at the urging of his family. Word first began to leak out late Tuesday when the State Department issued a cryptically worded advisory against travel to North Korea. Without mentioning Newman’s name, the advisory warned that the department had received reports of “authorities arbitrarily detaining U.S. citizens and not allowing them to leave the country.”

This is the seventh time that a U.S. citizen has been detained in North Korea since 2009, but previous cases have involved Christian missionaries or people who illegally entered the country, as in the case of two journalists who wandered across the Tumen River from China while reporting on border crossings. A Korean American missionary, Kenneth Bae, has been held in North Korea for more than a year.

Kerry did not directly address Merrill’s detainment Wednesday and only said the country has “other people” besides Bae.

“This is a real weird one,” said Daniel Sneider, a Korea specialist at Stanford University. “He is not an ethnic Korean. He is not a missionary running around distributing Bibles. We wonder if he said something he shouldn’t have or took pictures of something he shouldn’t have, but that doesn’t explain it.”

Sneider said that Newman’s detention raised questions anew about the stability of the North Korean government under Kim Jong Un, 30, who took the helm after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in December 2011.

“The real story here is what is going on in North Korea. Who is making the decisions?” Sneider said.

North Korea has in recent years become an exotic destination for tourists, who sign up for highly escorted package tours from Beijing to marvel at the grandiose communist monuments, the mass acrobatics and socialist kitsch, fast disappearing elsewhere in the 21st century. In 2010, North Korea eased its travel rules, making it easier for American citizens to visit.

“He really wanted to see Korea today,” said William M. Mason, a friend of Newman’s.

Newman, who lives with his ailing wife, had arranged his trip with a friend, Bob Hamrdla, a retired Stanford official who now organizes tours for alumni, according to people familiar with the case. The trip went as scheduled until the last morning, when the two men boarded an Air Koryo flight bound for Beijing.

“They were sitting, waiting to take off. A stewardess escorted two guys in uniform on the plane, and he has been held incommunicado ever since,” said Mason, a professor emeritus of sociology at UCLA. “When he didn’t come back as scheduled, the family got extremely worried. They don’t know how he is or whether he is getting his medication.”

The United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, and negotiations over Newman, as with other detainees, are being handled by the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.

The North Koreans have not commented about Newman or confirmed his detention, which is in itself unusual.

The United States so far has been unsuccessful in negotiations to free Bae, the longest-held U.S. detainee since the end of the Korean War.

That might seem strange given the angry rhetoric that regularly issues from Moscow, in particular from the Parliament, where Putin's United Russia party dominates. Just in December, Putin signed a bill banning the adoption of Russian orphans by Americans.

However, anti-Americanism has always been a complicated game for the Russian president. On the one hand, it plays well in the provinces. Since December 2011, when Moscow's boulevards erupted into protest, Putin has faced the most serious political challenge of his career. Having lost the support of sophisticated urbanites, his priority has been to shore up his provincial base.

One key strategy has been to appeal to more traditional and nationalist constituencies. Kremlin operatives attempt to discredit Putin's critics by portraying them as stooges for an interventionist Washington that seeks to interfere in Russian domestic life. In 2007, Putin compared his opponents to ""jackals,"" scrounging around outside foreign embassies for handouts.

Although exploiting xenophobia may seem crude, it works with some segments of the population. Putin wins widespread credit for standing up for Russia's rights and restoring the country's position in the world.

Still, while insisting on Russian sovereignty, Putin loses the aura of a skilled statesman if his policies provoke genuine crises. Behind the scenes, and even in public, he has sought accommodation on certain international issues. Putin, the anti-American in chief, personally faced down communist protesters to permit NATO to build a transit hub in the city of Ulyanovsk.

Some in Washington have urged President Obama to skip the G20 summit in St. Petersburg in September. Sen. Lindsey Graham even suggested boycotting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Putin would clearly like to avoid such snubs.

But were they to occur, he would cast them as yet another show of U.S. arrogance, a slap in the face not for him personally but for Russia. Assuming the leaders of Western European countries -- where many sympathize with Snowden -- do come to St. Petersburg, the final impression produced by Obama's empty chair might be less of Russian humiliation than of U.S. isolation.

For this and other reasons, the White House would probably also prefer to move beyond the Snowden issue. The U.S. public appears ambivalent at this point, uncomfortable about both Snowden's law-breaking and the scope of government snooping.

Yet the longer the issue remains in the public eye, the more embarrassing it is likely to become for the administration. For a U.S. attorney general to have to guarantee that a suspect would not be tortured if returned shows how much has changed over the past 12 years. The more officials turn out to have ""misspoken"" in denying existing surveillance programs, the lower trust in government is likely to sink.

At the same time, the U.S. has a broader agenda on which it needs to negotiate with Moscow. Syria continues to bleed. Although odds of a breakthrough are low, a joint U.S.-Russian peace conference is supposed to take place in Geneva this fall. The Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs remain urgent challenges. On these and other issues, Russia's U.N. Security Council seat makes it a crucial player.

Through 2014, as U.S. troops withdraw from Afghanistan, the NATO transport route across Russian territory will remain important. If Secretary of State John Kerry's latest attempt to revive Middle East peace talks is to bear fruit, the U.S. will at least need to persuade Russia not to become a spoiler.

Finally, even on Snowden, the White House may not want to push the Russians too far. As Andrew Kuchins, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out, the U.S. could do worse than to have Snowden remain -- under tight control -- in Moscow.

If Putin honors his pledge to stop Snowden harming what Putin called his ""American partners,"" then at least further leaks will be prevented. Were the Russians in frustration to put their uninvited guest on a plane to Ecuador or Cuba, the next morning's newspapers might contain additional revelations."

Report%3A Iran is developing and installing new and advanced centrifuges that can make bomb in month

President Obama has said Iran is a year or more away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb

A new report that says Iran may need as little as a month to produce enough uranium for a nuclear bomb is further evidence for why Israel will take military action before that happens, an Israeli defense official said Friday.

""We have made it crystal clear – in all possible forums, that Israel will not stand by and watch Iran develop weaponry that will put us, the entire Middle East and eventually the world, under an Iranian umbrella of terror,"" Danny Danon, Israel's deputy defense minister told USA TODAY.

Iran is developing and installing new and advanced centrifuges that enable Iran to enrich even low-enriched uranium to weapons grade uranium needed for nuclear weapons within weeks, Danon said.

""This speedy enrichment capability will make timely detection and effective response to an Iranian nuclear breakout increasingly difficult,"" he said.

""Breakout"" refers to the time needed to convert low-enriched uranium to weapons-grade uranium. On Thursday, the Institute for Science and International Security issued a report stating that Iran could reach that breakout in as little as one month based in part on Iran's own revelations about its nuclear program.

""If they use all their centrifuges ... and their stockpiles of low- and medium-enriched uranium, that would take one to 1.6 months,"" said David Albright, president of the institute and a former inspector for the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency.

The report comes as the White House is trying to persuade Congress not to go ahead with a bill to stiffen sanctions on Iran to force it to open up its program to inspection. The White House on Thursday invited senate staffers to a meeting on Iran strategy for negotiations that are to resume next month with Iran, it said.

In discussing Iran strategy, President Obama has said Iran is a year or more away from having enough enriched uranium to make a bomb.

Bernadette Meehan, an spokeswoman for the administration's National Security Council, said the intelligence community maintains ""a number of assessments"" regarding potential time frames for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for one weapon or a testable nuclear device.

""We continue to closely monitor the Iranian nuclear program and its stockpile of enriched uranium,"" Meehan said.

In the report, Albright said negotiations with Iran should focus on lengthening Iran's breakout time. ISIS' analysis is based on the latest Iranian and United Nations reports on Iran's centrifuge equipment for producing nuclear fuel and its nuclear fuel stockpiles.

Iran's stockpile of medium-enriched uranium has nearly doubled in a year's time and its number of centrifuges has expanded from 12,000 in 2012 to 19,000 today.

Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican whose Senate Banking Committee is considering legislation to tighten Iran sanctions, said the report shows that Iran is expanding its nuclear capabilities under the cover of negotiations.

""The Senate should move forward immediately with a new round of sanctions to prevent Iran from acquiring an undetectable breakout capability,"" he said. The House has already passed legislation to toughen sanctions.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his country has no interest in nuclear weapons but that producing nuclear fuel is Iran's right. However, Iran has blocked international inspectors from some suspected nuclear facilities, making it impossible to determine whether it is complying with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty it has signed.

United Nations inspectors say they have found evidence of a weapons program in violation of Iran's commitment under the treaty. The USA and the U.N. Security Council have implemented economic sanctions on Iran to persuade it abide by its obligation and verify it is not developing a bomb.

Albright says negotiations with Iran should focus on establishing protocols that lengthen the time period that it would take Iran to convert uranium to weapons grade uranium.

""An essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further,"" stated the report by the Institute for Science and International Security.

North Korea vows to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the U.S.

North Korea has now conducted three nuclear tests

U.N. approves new sanctions against North Korea

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is fully capable of defending itself against a North Korean ballistic missile attack, the White House said Thursday, after Pyongyang threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States.

The threat from Pyongyang came ahead of a unanimous vote in the U.N. Security Council approving its toughest sanctions yet on North Korea in response to an atomic test last month.

North Korea has escalated its bellicose statements this week as the tightening of U.N. sanctions loomed. It has also threatened to scrap the cease-fire that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.

""I can tell you that the United States is fully capable of defending against any North Korean ballistic missile attack,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

North Korea has now conducted three nuclear tests, although experts doubt it has mastered how to mount a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland United States.

The top U.S. envoy on North Korea, Glyn Davies, cautioned Pyongyang not to miscalculate, saying the U.S. will take necessary steps to defend itself and its allies, including South Korea, where it bases over 30,000 U.S. forces.

The U.S. also provides what it calls a ""nuclear umbrella"" security guarantee to both South Korea and Japan, neighbors of North Korea which do not have atomic weapons, and missile defense capabilities.

""We take all North Korean threats seriously enough to ensure that we have the correct defense posture to deal with any contingencies that might arise,"" Davies told reporters after testifying to a Senate foreign relations panel.

Thursday's statement out of Pyongyang appeared to be the most specific open threat of a nuclear strike by any country against another, but the Senate panel's chairman, Democrat Robert Menendez of New Jersey, said the threat was ""absurd"" and one that if carried out would be suicide.

Davies reiterated that the U.S. will not accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state — although after conducting three nuclear tests it is already assumed to have at least the capability to make at least a crude atomic bomb.

Davies, however, had to defend against Republican skepticism of the effectiveness of Obama administration's policy toward North Korea, which has taken strides in the past year toward its goal of having a nuclear weapon that can target the U.S. In December, it conducted its first successful launch of a three-stage, long-range rocket.

Ranking Republican Sen. Bob Corker, drew a comparison to U.S. policy on Iran, where the U.S. has warned it could resort to military action to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

North Korea is ""equally nutty"" and with a worse human rights record, and ""way past any red line we would accept in Iran,"" he said.

Corker concluded that Davies' hope that the dual-track U.S. policy of pressure and engagement would eventually work in getting Pyongyang to change its ways was a ""highly aspirational statement that does not seem to be based on reality.""

The new U.N. sanctions, supported by the North's chief ally and source of economic aid, China, should make it more difficult for Pyongyang to finance and obtain material for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and for the reclusive nation's ruling elite to acquire luxury goods.

Davies said the growing international condemnation of North Korea's actions and the new U.N. sanctions showed ""the world is beginning to wake up"" to the problem the North poses.

But U.S. lawmakers remain skeptical of Beijing's commitment to implementing the sanctions, which will be critical for their effectiveness as most of the companies and banks that North Korea is believed to work with are based in China."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/11/26/Valerie-Jarrett-Chicago-and-the-Iran-Deal,2013-11-26 00:00:00,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Valerie Jarrett, Chicago, and the Iran Deal","Last week, the Times of Israel reported that senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett had been leading talks with Iran in secret for a year before the formal negotiations in Geneva this month. While the White House denied the report “100 percent,” the existence of back-channel talks has been confirmed by other reporting. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that President Barack Obama had “personally overseen” the talks.

Almost anything “personally overseen” by the President Obama is likely to bear the heavy stamp of Ms. Jarrett, who is the president’s closest adviser, despite a shocking track record of failure. In foreign policy, her most important mistake was her effort to dissuade the president from proceeding with the raid on Osama bin Laden. It was one of the few times that President Obama overruled her counsel–and one of his few successes.

Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is cause for concern for three additional reasons–two minor and one major. One minor reason is that she was born there. That should not automatically disqualify anyone, of course, any more than being born in the Soviet Union would have disqualified an anti-Soviet dissident. But Jarrett was born in 1956 to American expatriates in the aftermath of the CIA-assisted coup that deposed Mohammad Mossadegh.

The Iranian regime remains obsessed with the Mossadegh coup as proof of America’s innate evil–and for decades, some Americans have felt a sense of post-colonial guilt about it. That feeling may be particularly acute for an American born in the shadow of that event. The temptation to show contrition by acceding to Iran’s goals, as a kind of restorative justice, could well shape Jarrett’s involvement, and Obama’s approach.

The second minor reason to worry about Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is her political background. Her entrée into the world of left-wing politics in Chicago was through her father-in-law, Vernon Jarrett, a journalist with somewhat radical views. Jarrett spoke out against antisemitism in the black community, for example, but also took anti-Israel stands, accusing pro-Israel Jews of “support of genocide” in the Lebanon War, for example.

These two reasons for concern are fairly minor, because they are based on mere speculation, and would have to be balanced out by other factors, such as Ms. Jarrett’s personal associations with leaders of the pro-Israel community in Chicago. But the major reason for concern about her role is simply that Jarrett has banished, and repulsed, most of the Obama administration’s most competent appointees from the White House.

One of the most important departures was that of Dennis Ross, who was brought into the White House early in the Obama presidency to advise the president on the Middle East. Ross, who advocated a tough approach to Iran, is widely thought to have been marginalized by the president’s inner circle. He left the White House in 2011, ostensibly because he had only promised to serve two years, but likely because he was not being utilized.

Finally, it is worth noting that Jarrett, despite her expatriate origins, has little experience in international affairs, and is said to manage Obama’s policies through a domestic political lens. If she was as involved in the talks as reports suggest, that could be a major reason for the president’s eagerness to sign almost any deal, even one the French rejected as too weak. In any other administration, she likely would have been ignored."

Some of the pupils were burned alive in the latest school attack blamed on a radical terror group, survivors said.

Parents screamed in anguish as they tried to identify the charred and gunshot victims.

Farmer Malam Abdullahi found the bodies of two of his sons, a 10-year-old shot in the back as he apparently tried to run away, and a 12-year-old shot in the chest.

""That's it, I'm taking my other boys out of school,"" he told The Associated Press as he wept over the two corpses. He said he had three younger children in a nearby school.

""It's not safe,"" he said. ""The gunmen are attacking schools and there is no protection for students despite all the soldiers.""

Survivors at the Potiskum General Hospital and its mortuary said gunmen attacked Government Secondary School in Mamudo village, 3 miles from Potiskum town at about 3 a.m. Saturday.

The gunmen are believed to be from the Boko Haram sect whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege.""

They killed 29 students and an English teacher Mohammed Musa, who was shot in the chest, according to another teacher, Ibrahim Abdu.

""We were sleeping when we heard gunshots. When I woke up, someone was pointing a gun at me,"" said 15-year-old Musa Hassan.

He put his arm up in defense, and suffered a gunshot that blew off all four fingers on his right hand, the one he uses to write with.

He said the gunmen came armed with jerry cans of fuel that they used to torch the school's administrative block and one of the hostels.

""They burned the children alive,"" he said, the horror showing in his wide eyes.

He and teachers at the morgue said dozens of children from the 1,200-student school escaped into the bush but have not been seen since.

Some bodies are so charred they could not be identified, so many parents do not know if their children survived or died.

Islamic militants from Boko Haram and breakaway groups have killed more than 1,600 civilians in suicide bombings and other attacks since 2010, according to an Associated Press count.

Scores of schools have been burned down in the past year in northeast Nigeria.

President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency May 14, and deployed thousands of troops to halt the insurgency, acknowledging that militants had taken control of some towns and villages.

The military has claimed success in regaining control of the area — the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe . However, the area covers some 155,000 square kilometers (60,000 square miles) or one-sixth of the sprawling country.

Soldiers say they have killed and arrested hundreds of fighters.

But the crackdown, including attacks with fighter jets and helicopter gunships on militant camps, appears to have driven the extremists into rocky mountains with caves, from which they emerge to attack schools and markets.

The militants have increasingly targeted civilians, including health workers on vaccination campaigns, teachers and government workers.

Farmers have been driven from their land by the extremists and by military roadblocks, raising the specter of a food shortage to add to the woes of a people already hampered by the military's shutdown of cell phone service and ban on using satellite telephones."

Administration efforts to seek support from lawmakers, including personal phone calls by the president, so far appear to have changed few minds.

Nor has the support of top Republican and Democratic congressional leaders in both houses, who have lined up behind President Obama’s plan to punish the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad for what U.S. officials say was a poison gas attack last month near Damascus that killed more than 1,400 people.

Administration officials say they remain optimistic about winning a vote in the Senate, expected later this week. Vice President Joe Biden hosted Obama and six GOP senators for dinner at the vice presidential residence Sunday night.

TRANSCRIPT: Obama’s remarks on Syria

But even in the Senate, the result remains in doubt and may require Biden to break a tie vote. And in the House, the support of Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) has not swayed an impromptu liberal-conservative alliance that opposes the Syria plan.

The president faces a potent dual threat — Republicans who don’t trust and won’t support him despite the urgings of their leadership and a sizable antiwar contingent of Democrats who oppose military action except for national self-defense. Public opposition to the proposed cruise missile strikes against Syria has bolstered those lawmakers.

Congressional and White House aides cautioned against drawing “premature” tallies of the votes, because many lawmakers are just considering the issue as they return from the monthlong summer recess.

But the nature of the White House lobbying, heavily focused on groups who are ordinarily among the president’s strongest supporters, highlights how difficult Obama’s position has become. Officials plan to bus members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the White House on Monday so national security advisor Susan Rice can personally urge them to support military action in Syria. Several members of the caucus already have publicly opposed a military strike.

Pelosi has nudged her troops almost daily. A letter Saturday suggested they consider the work of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a liberal ally, who voted to approve the Syria resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The White House is well accustomed to losing legislative battles because of Republican opposition. But large-scale defections among Democrats would create a high-profile, bipartisan rebuke of a president’s foreign policy wishes, a move that has little precedent.

To try to avoid that, Obama plans to step up his personal efforts, blanketing the airwaves with a series of television interviews Monday and a speech to the nation and a visit to Capitol Hill to meet Senate Democrats on Tuesday.

Obama plans to emphasize several key points, according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity in discussing White House strategy: Officials have no doubt Assad is responsible for the sarin gas attack, a military strike would be limited, the U.S. has exhausted all diplomatic channels, and it is up to the U.S. to act.

The messaging blitz might not move poll numbers, the official said. But it is aimed in part at lawmakers who have wanted the president to own the case for action.

Meantime, Assad, in a rare interview, sent his own message, warning against military involvement by the United States.

CBS News said Sunday that in the interview Assad threatened that “people aligned with him” would retaliate against the U.S. for any attack and denied using chemical weapons. The network plans to air the interview Monday; interviewer Charlie Rose previewed its contents Sunday on “Face the Nation.”

Administration officials said that they had spoken to at least 85 senators and more than 165 House members in the last two weeks, an unusual accounting of its behind-the-scenes lobbying that implicitly acknowledged the stakes of the fight that none of Obama’s advisors expected and some argued against having.

But the conversations so far have had limited effect. One undecided House Democrat from a moderate district entered the week wary but looking for a reason to support the president, said an aide who asked for anonymity in discussing the lawmaker’s thinking.

A week of briefings and a review of the administration’s case left the lawmaker only more convinced that the administration could not promise the “limited” intervention Obama has described.

With the congressional midterm reelection fight around the corner, the lawmaker would need a powerful reason to defy the clear message coming from constituents.

“All we’re hearing is no,” the House aide said of the calls coming to the congressional office.

In addition to its efforts with Democrats, the White House is enlisting former Bush administration officials and Republican foreign policy experts to appeal to GOP lawmakers. However, the vote count so far has illustrated not just Obama’s weakness on Capitol Hill but also stark divisions among Republicans.

The onetime GOP unity on foreign affairs has splintered, with the party’s anti-interventionist wing growing in strength. The more traditional hawks appear unable to influence the newer libertarians.

The unusual left-right partnership was evident Sunday as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a tea party champion, cited Dennis Kucinich, a favorite of the Democratic left wing, as the source for his suggestion that a cruise missile attack on Assad’s government would turn the U.S. into “Al Qaeda’s air force.”

The reality that some of the rebel groups fighting Assad have links to Al Qaeda is one of several issues that lawmakers of both parties, even those inclined to back Obama, have wrestled with.

In the Senate, only a handful of Republicans, led by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), have said they will support military action against Syria.

Failure to win congressional approval of a strike against Syria, which Obama abruptly decided to pursue a week ago, could harm his second-term agenda not only in foreign affairs, but in domestic policy as well. Budget issues and immigration reform, his top domestic priority, are pending in Congress.

“If Congress won’t support him on this, they’ll be much more willing to say no,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public policy at Princeton University.

“It will signal that Obama can’t move Congress,” he said, and “just as troublesome, it will show again that the Republican leadership can’t control its caucus, and liberal Democrats are no longer willing to stand behind him out of loyalty.”

On Sunday, the administration sent White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough onto all five network public affairs talk shows to make the case for the Syria policy, hoping he would accomplish more than Secretary of State John F. Kerry did with a similar set of television appearances a week earlier.

“The question for Congress this week is a very simple one: Should there be consequences for his having used gases, chemical weapons, to kill more than 1,000 of his own people, including more than 400 children?” McDonough said. U.S. failure to act would encourage Iran, Hezbollah and other U.S. adversaries, he said.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), an Air Force pilot during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who supports striking Syria, expressed his frustration with Congress and the White House.

“We’re all war weary,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“But this is a moment in time where I think in 10, 20, 30 years, the history books are going to say this was a redefining moment in world history, and what was the United States doing?”

Chụp lại hình ảnh, Ông Obama sẽ không gặp ông Putin dù vẫn tới St Petersburg.

Tổng thống Hoa Kỳ Barack Obama đã hủy cuộc gặp lên lịch từ trước với Tổng thống Nga Vladimir Putin sau khi Nga cho người lộ tin tình báo Edward Snowden tị nạn, theo tin từ Nhà Trắng.

Nhưng ông Obama sẽ vẫn tới St Petersburg để dự hội nghị của các nước G20 bàn về kinh tế từ 5-6 tháng Chín.

Một trợ lý Nhà Trắng nói việc ông Snowden được tị nạn ở Nga đã làm sâu sắc thêm quan hệ vốn đã căng thẳng giữa hai nước.

Cựu nhân viên làm hợp đồng cho ngành tình báo của Hoa Kỳ đã thừa nhận tiết lộ thông tin về các chương trình do thám của Hoa Kỳ cho truyền thông đại chúng.

Quyết định hủy hội đàm, được công bố trong chuyến đi của ông Obama tới Los Angeles, được đưa ra sau khi ông Obama nói ông ""thất vọng"" với quyết định của Nga cho ông Snowden tị nạn trong một năm.

Sau phát biểu của trợ lý Nhà Trắng Ben Rhodes, bản thân Nhà Trắng cũng ra tuyên bố nói:

""Chúng tôi tin rằng hoãn cuộc họp thượng đỉnh cho tới khi hai bên có thêm kết quả từ chương trình nghị sự chung là có tính xây dựng hơn.""

Lần cuối cùng hai ông Obama và Putin gặp nhau là bên lề Hội nghị Thượng đỉnh G8 ở Bắc Ireland.

'Vẫn hợp tác'

Nhân vật được cho là khiến hội đàm song phương bị hoãn, ông Snowden, từng làm việc cho Cơ quan An ninh Quốc gia (NSA) của Hoa Kỳ trong vai trò kỹ thuật viên và cũng từng là nhân viên của CIA.

Hồi tháng Sáu cựu nhân viên tình báo này để lộ các tài liệu liên quan tới những chương trình thu thập dữ liệu qua điện thoại và thư điện tử của NSA cho báo Guardian và Washington Post.

Sau đó ông Snowden đã trốn khỏi nhà ở Hawaii,nơi ông làm việc tại một đơn vị nhỏ của NSA, và tới Hong Kong và sau đó là Nga.

Ông Snowden đã trú tạm tại khu quá cảnh ở sân bay của Nga trong vòng một tháng trong khi Hoa Kỳ gây sức ép để các nước khác từ chối chấp nhận ông này tới tị nạn.

Ông Snowden rời sân bay hôm 1/8 sau khi chính quyền Nga nói họ cho ông tị nạn trong một năm.

Nói chuyện với người dẫn chương trình có tiếng của Hoa Kỳ Jay Leno trong đêm thứ Ba, ông Obama khẳng định cam kết tham gia đàm phán với Nga nhân tham dự G20.

Nhưng Phó cố vấn an ninh quốc gia Ben Rhodes nói hôm thứ Tư rằng ông Obama sẽ không tham gia đàm phán tay đôi với ông ở Moscow hay bên lề hội nghị thượng đỉnh G20.

Ông Rhodes nói: ""Chúng tôi sẽ vẫn hợp tác với Nga trong những vấn đề chúng tôi có thể tìm được những điểm chung, nhưng cả tổng thống và ban an ninh quốc gia đều thấy cuộc gặp thượng đỉnh không hợp lý trong môi trường hiện nay,"" ông Rhodes được hãng tin Hoa Kỳ Associated Press dẫn lời nói."

More than a week has passed since U.S. officials asked the Hong Kong government to arrest Edward Snowden, but the whereabouts of the former contractor who leaked documents about top-level surveillance programs remained unknown Saturday.

The reason for the apparent lack of action in the case is unclear. The delay could be related to the issuing of the warrant. Or officials may still be looking for Snowden, who is believed to be in Hong Kong but could also have found a way to leave the semiautonomous region.

The U.S. government asked Hong Kong to detain Snowden on a provisional arrest warrant June 14, the same day it filed criminal charges against him, including theft, “unauthorized communication of national defense information” and “willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.”

The fact that the U.S. government asked Hong Kong to detain Snowden emerged Friday when The Washington Post disclosed the contents of a sealed criminal complaint that alluded to the request.

Under an extradition treaty between Hong Kong and the United States, a provisional warrant, as opposed to a regular one, is a faster way to detain suspected criminals since it does not require the initial approval of Hong Kong’s leader, currently Leung Chun-ying.

The material included sensitive diplomatic cables and videos of airstrikes that killed civilians. Read the article. Cliff Owen/AP Wait 1 second to continue.

Instead, a judge can issue the warrant immediately. Simon Young, a legal professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that means a warrant for Snowden’s arrest could have been issued as early as June 14.

The office of Leung, Hong Kong’s chief executive, declined to comment on Snowden’s case Saturday. The police department did not respond to calls and e-mails.

Meanwhile, plans to protect Snowden appeared to be unfolding. Olafur Sigurvinsson, an Icelandic businessman, told reporters Thursday that he has a private jet ready to take Snowden to Iceland, a potential safe haven named by Snowden in interviews.

A spokesperson representing the Hong Kong Aviation Center, which handles private jet flights out of Hong Kong, did not comment on whether Snowden, or anyone on his behalf, had made plans to fly out.

“For privacy reason [sic], we do not disclose to external parties the identity of our passengers or information about their flight arrangement,” KK Yuen said in an e-mail.

Yuen also said that all passengers must go through immigration and customs checks. In other words, Snowden could have trouble leaving on a private jet without tipping off authorities.

A potentially drawn-out and complex legal process awaits the former contractor, who turned 30 on Friday, and the U.S. officials trying to remove him from Hong Kong.

If Snowden is arrested, he must be brought “as soon as practicable” before a Hong Kong judge, according to the extradition treaty. That judge will then decide whether he should be removed from Hong Kong under the terms of the treaty.

Among other things, the treaty requires that any criminal charges filed against Snowden must be both listed in the treaty and involve an offense that could land him in prison for more than a year in both the United States and Hong Kong.

Young, the legal expert, said that while the crime of theft clearly passed that test, the two communication-related charges “will likely attract litigation and dispute in the courts.” Those two charges are not listed explicitly in the treaty, although “offences involving the unlawful use of computers” is included, something U.S. officials may use in their legal arguments.

Snowden can challenge any initial ruling to extradite him all the way to Hong Kong’s highest court, a process that could take months to run its course.

In addition, he can submit an application for asylum to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ office in Hong Kong, which processes most asylum claims in the city. An enormous backlog means an application from Snowden could take months or even years to clear. Under Hong Kong law, the government would not be able to extradite him until his asylum request was processed.

UNHCR did not respond to requests for comment Saturday.

Regina Ip, a Hong Kong legislator and former security secretary, said Snowden will have plenty of defenders if he is arrested.

“I think if he stays in Hong Kong, there will be no lack of human-rights lawyers who are happy to help him,” she said Saturday.

Last weekend, 200 to 300 protesters marched by the U.S. Consulate to support Snowden, applauding his release of classified documents showing secret surveillance operations by the United States.

Hong Kong is in an unusual position in the matter, in that it has an independent legal system but must ultimately answer to mainland Chinese leadership in Beijing.

Snowden’s story has occasionally made the headlines in China, where some of his critiques of the U.S. government echo allegations by China’s leadership that the United States points fingers at other countries even as it violates civil liberties itself.

On Saturday, some Chinese netizens praised Snowden on hearing the news that criminal charges had been filed against him. Others expressed doubt that he would receive a fair trial in the United States.

“I reckon it will be a secret trial . . . or just no trial,” wrote a used named Xiaolai on the Twitter-like microblog weibo.

Said another user, Kingbo Lee: “Snowden is a hero, a hero of the world’s people. Foreign countries must offer political asylum and support Snowden.”

Will: Better a contained Iran than an all-out war,"Critics of the agreement with Iran concerning its nuclear program are right about most things but wrong about the most important things. They understand the agreement’s manifest and manifold defects and its probable futility. Crucial components of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure remain. U.S. concessions intended to cultivate the Iranian regime’s “moderates” are another version of the fatal conceit that U.S. policy can manipulate other societies. As is the hope that easing economic sanctions would create an Iranian constituency demanding nuclear retreat in exchange for yet more economic relief. Critics are, however, wrong in thinking that any agreement could control Iran’s nuclear aspirations. And what critics consider the agreement’s three worst consequences are actually benefits.

The six-month agreement, with ongoing negotiations, makes it impossible for the United States to attack its negotiating partner. Hence the agreement constrains Israel, which lacks the military capacity to be certain of a success commensurate with the risks of attacking Iran. Therefore there is no alternative to a policy of containment of a nuclear Iran.

Iran’s claim that its nuclear program is for power generation and medical uses is risible. So is the notion that negotiations have any likely utility establishing the predicate for containment of an Iran with nuclear weapons or with the capacity to produce them quickly.

There is a recently published primer for the perplexed: “Unthinkable: Iran, the Bomb, and American Strategy” by Kenneth M. Pollack of the Brookings Institution. Measured in his judgments, scrupulous in presenting arguments with which he disagrees, Pollack comes to this conclusion: “Going to war with Iran to try to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear arsenal would be a worse course of action than containing Iran, even a nuclear Iran.”

Some advocates of war seem gripped by Thirties Envy, a longing for the clarity of the 1930s, when appeasement failed to slake the dictators’ thirst for territorial expansion. But the incantation “Appeasement!” is not an argument. And the word “appeasement” does not usefully describe a sober decision that war is an imprudent and even ultimately ineffective response to the failure of diplomatic and economic pressures to alter a regime’s choices about policies within its borders.

Israel’s superb air force is too small, when striking over great distances at hidden and hardened targets, to do more than set back Iran’s program a few years, at most. And an attack might cause Iran to expel the international inspectors or accelerate the crumbling of the sanctions, thereby speeding the reconstitution of the weapons program.

A U.S. attack could do much more damage but could not prevent reconstitution. So, if stopping the program is important enough for war, is it important enough for an invasion of a nation with almost three times the population of Iraq and nearly four times the size?

In December 2011, Leon Panetta, then secretary of defense, said that if Iran were seen “proceeding with developing a nuclear weapon” or had decided to do that, the United States would “take whatever steps are necessary to stop it.” In March 2012, Barack Obama said: “Iran’s leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.” His “red line” was the weaponization of fissile material.

Yet in his Nov. 23 statement celebrating the new agreement, Obama spoke of wanting to be able to “verify” that Iran “cannot build a nuclear weapon.” If so, he rejects not only containment but allowing Iran to stop near — “a screwdriver’s turn away from” — weaponization. But Pollack, writing many months before the recent agreement ratified Iran’s right to enrichment, said:

“As long as Iran is left with the capacity to enrich uranium, the right to perform some enrichment activity, and a stockpile of LEU (low-enriched uranium) . . . then Iran will have a breakout capability. It could be a breakout window as wide as many months, perhaps even a year, but Iran will have the capability to manufacture the fissile material for a nuclear weapon.”

The agreement will not stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons; only a highly unlikely Iranian choice can do that. The agreement may, however, prevent a war to prevent Iran from acquiring such weapons. If Pollack is right, and he certainly is persuasive, we have two choices, war or containment. Those who prefer the former have an obligation to clearly say why its consequences would be more predictable and less dire than those in the disastrous war with Iraq.

A full 52% “strongly agree” that Benghazi is a “serious issue that needs to be investigated,” while 17% “agree.” That’s a total of 69%.

Because the mainstream media has conspired (it must be noted that there are a number of notable individual exceptions) with the White House over the last eight months to downplay Libya, you might think that particular scandal would generate less interest than the IRS scandal — which the media have taken much more seriously. Surprisingly, though, the numbers aren’t all that different. When asked the same question about the IRS, 56% “strongly agree” and 18% “agree;” for a total of 74% — which is only 5 points higher than Libya.

The numbers for Libya create a real dilemma for the White House and its lapdog media. The no there “there” Narrative they have spent eight months manufacturing obviously isn’t working. Moreover, the motive behind this Narrative is a sinister one: neither Obama nor his media want the truth to get out, and both know that the more the people learn about the administration’s handling of Libya, the worse it will be for the administration.

For instance, with the release of the 94 emails earlier this week, we now know for a fact that the White House repeatedly lied with their claim that the administration played no role in shaping the CIA talking points. The media, though, refuse to hold the White House accountable for that lie and prefer to pretend the emails actually do back the administration’s claim.

The main reason the media have smothered the damning revelations found in the emails, though, is to protect Hillary Clinton. It was the State Department that demanded what amounted to almost a total rewrite of the completed talking points, and won them. But the media see Hillary as the best chance they have for keeping the White House out of Republican hands in 2016, and so they are circling the wagons for her, just like they have for Obama for the last five years.

Plus, even though the media isn’t demanding more, we still don’t have all the information regarding the shaping of the talking points. These information gaps are critical, and to say we should take the White House’s word for anything at this point is a joke.

The media are also ignoring and smothering the effort to find out who gave the order to “stand down” when it came to sending help to Americans under attack that night. And when it comes to finding out what exactly the President was doing during those horrific hours during which the attack took place, the media is laughably uncurious.

To protect the White House from having to reveal the truth, the President and his media have developed a strategy that smears as partisan witch-hunters anyone searching for the truth. This includes any Republican in Congress pushing for investigations and, naturally, Fox News.

But from the looks of this poll, the witch-hunters have the will of the people on their side–a whopping 69% of them. That’s a huge number, but if you think about, not really a surprising one. When Americans die, decent people believe everything should be fully investigated and made public.

The American people are, by and large, decent.

This White House and its media, however, are not.

Hopefully this poll will only further embolden the GOP and Fox News and the exceptions in the media to continue to do the decent thing: Find and tell the complete truth about what led to the deaths of an ambassador and three other Americans.

Sanger', 'Alison Smale']",U.S.-Germany Intelligence Partnership Falters Over Spying,"Germany has for years participated in American counterterrorism operations, especially those tracking suspected Al Qaeda or other terrorist cells inside Germany, but it has refused to provide the United States with information that it believes could help provide targets for drone strikes. Now, officials are reluctant to join in some types of bulk collection of telephone data or preparations for offensive digital strikes against other countries.

“We simply don’t have the capability or the legal authorities,” said one senior German official involved in the talks, who, like other officials interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations are confidential.

The White House has tried to engage the German leadership quietly, hoping to avoid further public confrontations while Ms. Merkel formed her new government.

“At the president’s and chancellor’s direction, we continue to talk with our German partners about how we can strengthen our intelligence cooperation and address some of the concerns that have been raised,” Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said Saturday. “We’ve agreed that these talks are best held confidentially, so I’m not going to provide any details at this stage.”

Nonetheless, in interviews in the past week, American and German officials described a continued wariness in the countries’ relationship after documents that the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel received from Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, revealed the apparent tracking of Ms. Merkel’s personal cellphone and suggested that other surveillance operations had been run out of the United States Embassy here.

While Mr. Obama tried to make amends, several senior German officials expressed suspicions that the United States might be using its surveillance technology to strengthen its negotiating hand in trade talks with the European Union, in which Germany is the most important player.

The dispute also reflects very different views of how far the state should go in conducting surveillance, both at home and abroad."

Washington (CNN) - America's top diplomat dismissed concerns Sunday that the Obama administration was not being skeptical enough while the U.S. negotiates with Iran over its continued enrichment of uranium, activity widely assumed to be supporting a nuclear weapons program.

Secretary of State John Kerry emphatically told David Gregory on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday that ""we are not blind, and I don't think we're stupid"" when it comes to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's past claims that he could game the Western world in brokered talks while his nation continued to pursue its nuclear ambitions.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='jhseher']

Kerry's remarks came the morning after three days of intensive talks about Iran's nuclear program concluded early Sunday in Geneva, Switzerland, without an agreement. While the key players, including Kerry, insisted the process continues to move in the right direction, the talks raised fears among U.S. allies that Iran was presenting a disingenous front and has no real intention of slowing its march toward weaponizing its nuclear technology.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not involved in the talks, warned last week that an agreement would be ""the deal of a century for Iran"" but a ""very dangerous and bad deal for peace.""

With new talks scheduled for November 20, Kerry's Iranian counterpart signaled that progress had been made and the two sides are getting closer and closer to reaching an accord.

""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said.

Kerry trumpeted the historic nature of the talks, calling them ""serious business.”

""This is the first time that the P5 had come together with this kind of a serious set of possible options in front of it with a new Iranian government,"" Kerry said.

The talks involve the P5+1: the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - the countries with permanent seats on the UN Security Council - plus Germany.

Still, in his interview with Gregory, Kerry maintained a healthy dose of skepticism, falling back on the oft-sounded catchall that the administration ""has taken no option off the table.""

""This is a new overture, and it has to be put to the test very, very carefully,"" Kerry said.

""There will not be a relaxation of the pressure,"" he added. ""Nobody has talked about getting rid of the current architecture of sanctions. The pressure will remain."""

The Pentagon has in recent days stepped up planning for potential military intervention in the Syrian civil war, specifically because of growing evidence the regime may have used chemical weapons, CNN has learned.

""There is intensified planning in the works as more precise information comes in on the Syrian regime's potential use of chemical weapons and the body of evidence grows,"" a senior administration official said.

The official, who has direct knowledge of the effort, declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.

If President Barack Obama were to order action, it could involve thousands of U.S. troops. But all of the options face serious military challenges.



The official said it's not likely to involve troops on the ground in Syria. Two other officials say the most likely options would be using cruise missiles based at sea and fighter jets to try to destroy chemical sites or the headquarters of Syrian military elements linked to them.

But even that type of option has grown increasingly complex in recent weeks as the Syrian regime has moved chemical stockpiles around the country.

""We have to now assume they are going to continue to do so,"" the official said, noting that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey has already told Congress the military could not secure the entire chemical stockpile because it does not know where it's all located.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and other senior civilian officials at the Pentagon have sought updated military options in the last few weeks as suspicions and intelligence grew that the Syrian regime had used sarin gas on its own people.

The official said Obama so far has not asked for those options, but the Pentagon was moving ahead to be prepared.

""As the situation in Syria becomes more grave and as we are increasingly concerned about chemical weapons use in Syria, it's the responsibility of the U.S. military to prepare detailed options,"" the official said.

Hagel told reporters on Monday that he would not speculate any options regarding Syria.

The updated planning is separate from recent discussions with Congress several weeks ago about options for Syria, the official said.

There are also specific new discussions with Israel, Turkey and Jordan about what the official called the ""realities of the conflict.""

These discussions center around what to do if chemical weapons become a risk to their populations and also what immediate actions would have to be taken if the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were to suddenly fall.

The new planning, he said, is an effort to ""align"" military capabilities with various options and scenarios that could likely emerge.

But he also emphasized it also involves looking at more direct U.S. military involvement in providing humanitarian relief for the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees now in Jordan and Turkey.

A previously announced deployment of some personnel from the First Armored Division headquarters to Jordan is part of this stepped up planning effort."

(CNN) —

It’s official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria.

Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons.

The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force “to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.”

It’s a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle.

There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react?

In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to – but because he wants to.

“While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,” he said. “We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.”

Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said.

Syrian crisis: Latest developments

U.N. inspectors leave Syria

Obama’s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb.

“The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear – and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used – and not by whom,” U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday.

But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis.

Top U.S. officials have said there’s no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels.

British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors.

The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team’s final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected.

“It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,” Nesirky said.

He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that “a military solution is not an option.”

Obama: ‘This menace must be confronted’

Obama’s senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president’s comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.

Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament’s vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama’s hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies.

On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said.

Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month “is an assault on human dignity,” the president said.

A failure to respond with force, Obama argued, “could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.”

Obama decision came Friday night

On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers.

What will happen if they vote no?

It’s unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress – even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force.

Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government.

He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech.

“The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime – and others who would consider using chemical weapons – that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,” the White House said.

Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready.

Reactions mixed to Obama’s speech

A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama’s announcement.

“Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,” said spokesman Louay Safi. “So we are quite concerned.”

Some members of Congress applauded Obama’s decision.

House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president.

“Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,” the Republican lawmakers said. “We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.”

More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama’s fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a “full debate” before any U.S. action.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama’s speech in a Twitter post Saturday.

“I understand and support Barack Obama’s position on Syria,” Cameron said.

An influential lawmaker in Russia – which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States – had his own theory.

“The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress: the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,” Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post.

In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday.

“Like many other Americans…we’re just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,” said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration.

Syria’s government unfazed

After Obama’s speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is “embarrassed” that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is “crying for help” for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats – on the political and military levels.

Syria’s prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling.

“The Syrian Army’s status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,” Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama’s address.

An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama “appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.”

A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States.

“I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,” said Bashar Jaafari, Syria’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Both Obama and Cameron, he said, “climbed to the top of the tree and don’t know how to get down.”

The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it.

British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350.

On Saturday, Obama said “all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.” U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy.

About 70%25 of South Koreans say the government should develop a nuclear bomb

The U.S. guarantees to defend South Korea if attacked

North Korea may soon be able to strike the U.S. homeland

Increasing tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and provocations are pushing more South Koreans to raise the once unthinkable: developing their own nuclear deterrent, analysts said Monday.

South Korean lawmaker Chung Mong Joon of the governing Saenuri, or New Frontier Party, indicated that the South may have to look into a nuclear deterrent given that North Korea is acting like ""a gangster.""

The South Korean newspaper Joong Ang Ilbo suggested in an editorial that the U.S. ""nuclear umbrella"" may not be enough. Although the South is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons treaty, which means the country cannot legally develop nuclear weapons, the newspaper says the North's threats mean new defenses must be considered.

""Nuclear weapons can be stopped only with nuclear weapons, as in the mutual assured destruction that prevented a nuclear conflict during the Cold War,"" it said.

Bruce Klingner, former deputy chief for Korea in the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence under President Bill Clinton, says a nuclear South is a ""non-starter.""

A nuclear-armed South Korea could cause Japan, a U.S. ally that has tense relations with South Korea, to go nuclear, too, creating unnecessary instability in the northeast Asia region, Klingner said. Besides, he said, South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953 has had the same assurances that the United States would defend it that Western Europe has had since the end of World War II.

""We are bound to defend South Korea by all means necessary,"" Klingner said. ""You can question whether any individual president would trade New York for London or Los Angeles for Seoul, but the guarantee is that we would do so.""

Tokyo member of parliament Shintaro Ishihara of the Japan Restoration Party has said Japan should have nuclear bombs to counter China and North Korea. Though its constitution restricts Japan's ability to possess certain weaponry, recently elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe supports revising the document to allow for more military defenses.

Over the weekend, North Korea canceled an armistice agreement that has been in place nearly all of the 60 years since the end of the Korean War. It said it would cut ties such as a telephone ""hotline"" between the North and South that can be used in times of crisis.

This comes a week after the North threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the USA and all-out war with the South over stricter sanctions passed last week by the United Nations Security Council to punish North Korea for its third test of a nuclear weapon in February and missile tests.

Heightened tensions continue this week as U.S. and South Korean forces engage in a joint military exercise. North Korea's military is holding drills of its own near the line that demarcates North from South. Both sets of exercises are an annual event.

When such a large grouping of military forces are in close proximity to each other, ""there's an increased opportunity for a clash,"" Klingner said.

Despite his belief that a nuclear South is a bad idea, Klingner agreed that North Korea's steady progress toward developing a deliverable nuclear weapon is causing South Korean attitudes to harden.

About 70% of South Koreans say their country should develop its own nuclear deterrent, according to several polls. Several columnists and conservative politicians are questioning whether they can count on the United States to risk a nuclear attack if it comes to the South's defense in a nuclear contest, he said.

Bruce Bechtol, a former China and Korea analyst at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency who teaches at Angelo State University in Texas, said South Koreans are probably right about one thing: Even in the case of a North Korean nuclear attack on the South, the United States would be unlikely to respond with in kind, Bechtol said.

South Korea is under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, but the best response to an attack would probably be with conventional weapons, Bechtol said.

""If we're fighting a war with North Korea, the end state of that war would be a unified country with a capital in Seoul,"" Bechtol said. ""If we used nuclear weapons, we'd be creating a mess that the South Koreans would have to deal with. ... My guess would be that the (South Korean) government themselves would want us to use nuclear weapons as a last option.""

South Koreans pushing for their own nuclear capability ""are anticipating the day when North Korea can hit the continental United States with nuclear weapons,"" says Richard Bush, who served as an East Asia specialist in the National Intelligence Council under Clinton.

They're asking, ""Is the United States willing to sacrifice San Francisco if deterrence fails?"" Bush said. ""This is the same logic that led Great Britain, France, China and Israel to want their own deterrent.""

The South's conservative new president, Park Geun Hye, has not advocated following the nuclear path, but she promised to respond ""exponentially"" to any North Korean attack. South Koreans were unhappy with her predecessor's restraint in 2010, when North Korea sank a South Korean patrol ship, then shelled the South's Yeonpyeong Island, killing four people.

Park's promise to deliver a non-proportional response to future provocations from the North is a departure from past practice and could result in war because the North's reaction is impossible to predict, Klingner said.

""If you respond, you are unsure how your opponent will respond,"" he said. ""Will he call it even or will he then raise the stakes?"""

Chemical weapons experts say send gas masks, not bombs

White House: A ""clear violation"" of global standards needs a response

Strikes are ""more about Washington saving face,"" historian says

The United States and its allies face a variety of risks in taking direct military action against Syria over allegations that it used chemical weapons against civilians, including more poison gas attacks and retaliation against American interests.

Those warnings come from experts in chemical weapons and veteran Middle East analysts, some of whom say Washington faces no good choices in confronting embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

Missile strikes on Syrian military command bunkers, airfields or the artillery batteries and rocket launchers used to fire chemical projectiles are among the options U.S. officials say are under consideration. But there is no indication that the missiles would target stockpiles of chemical weapons -- something Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the British military's chemical defense regiment, called ""the worst possible option.""

""If the missile and the explosive are big enough, they will, of course, destroy it,"" de Bretton-Gordon said. ""However, there will be a downwind hazard, and those people in the vicinity -- and it's very difficult to say how far, but certainly a kilometer or so -- are likely going to suffer and become casualties from the fallout of those exploding chemical weapons.""

And any attack on Syria might encourage al-Assad to order more chemical attacks on rebel forces and civilians in opposition-held areas, said Amy Smithson, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Washington.

""Not doing anything tells Assad he's not going to get punished, go out and use the chemicals,"" said Smithson, who has studied chemical and biological weapons for two decades. ""Striking the chemical sites presents a very real risk of releasing toxic chemicals over nearby civilian populations. Not striking the chemical sites leaves Assad with potent weapons in his hands that he's shown he's willing to use.""

Striking other military targets leaves ""a very ticked-off despot that is now perhaps even more tempted to use his chemical arsenal,"" she said. ""He's already been punished for it."" That might convince al-Assad to go out ""in a blaze of glory -- or in this case, infamy.""

Juan Cole, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Michigan, said the kind of intervention being discussed isn't likely to affect the balance of power in the 2-year-old Syrian conflict beyond providing a psychological boost to the rebels, who have suffered battlefield setbacks over the summer.

""This is more about Washington saving face, it seems to me, than it is a consequential intervention in the Syrian conflict,"" Cole said, adding, ""When you're in a position where it is assumed that the United States must do something, a couple of Tomahawks make a statement.""

The war ""is being fought in alleyways and at close quarters, with artillery and tanks inside cities,"" he said. Missile strikes from distant warships or aircraft wouldn't be able to knock out enough of those weapons to make a difference without inflicting extensive civilian losses, he said.

Syria has admitted to possessing chemical weapons but has denied using them, saying its troops were the victims of rebel attacks. U.N. inspectors are now in Syria to investigate whether the reported deaths of hundreds of people outside Damascus a week ago was the result of a chemical attack. But U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday there was ""no doubt"" government troops used chemical weapons on civilians.

The United States has already demanded that al-Assad cede power and is supporting Syria's opposition, but the possible American strikes are not about removing him, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.

""They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons,"" Carney said.

Syria's civil war is already spilling over the borders of its neighbors in the form of bombings and refugees and is widely seen as a proxy war among different regional powers . Cole said al-Assad's government might try to strike back by targeting American military, diplomatic or commercial interests in the Middle East, perhaps employing its allies in the Lebanese militia Hezbollah -- which has a long and bloody track record targeting Americans during Lebanon's long civil war.

""If Washington bombs things in Syria, I wouldn't want to be an American in Beirut within reaching distance of Hezbollah,"" he said. ""You could see a return to 1980s types of things happening, when our embassy was blown up in Beirut and our CIA station chief was kidnapped and killed in the woods.""

Both de Bretton-Gordon and Smithson said a better course of action might be to start supplying Syrians with the means to defend themselves against chemical attack. That means distributing masks, detectors and drugs used to treat patients exposed to nerve gas and training Syrians how to use them.

Smithson said those supplies and training could be provided by numerous countries, whose militaries are trained in chemical defense, and rushed into the field by aid agencies and opposition groups, possibly via neighboring Turkey. It could be done ""very quickly and very publicly,"" and with broader support from the international community than American airstrikes, she said.

""If the civilian population can be equipped to contend with this, just as they have adjusted their lifestyles to adapt to urban warfare around them, then perhaps that takes away some of the advantage,"" she said. ""If your chemical attack doesn't have an effect, then why use the weapons?"""

Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, the author of “Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden – From 9/11 to Abbottabad” and a director at the New America Foundation.

(CNN) —

The appearance Friday in a lower Manhattan courtroom of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law and one-time al Qaeda spokesman, to face charges of conspiracy to kill Americans underlines the perhaps surprising fact that members of bin Laden’s inner circle have been living in Iran for the past decade or so.

It was Abu Ghaith’s decision to leave the comparative safety of his longtime refuge in Iran for Turkey a few weeks ago that led to the chain of events that landed him in Manhattan for trial.

The leading Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, reported that Abu Ghaith was detained in the Turkish capital, Ankara, in early February. Turkey then decided to deport him to his native Kuwait via Jordan, where he was intercepted by FBI agents, who escorted him to New York.

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

As is well known, many of bin Laden’s family and members of his inner circle fled Afghanistan for Pakistan after the fall of the Taliban in the winter of 2001, but what is less well known is that some also fled to neighboring Iran.

According to U.S. documents and officials, in addition to Abu Ghaith, other of bin Laden’s inner circle who ended up in Iran include the formidable military commander of al Qaeda, Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian Special Forces officer who had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, as well as Saad bin Laden, one of the al Qaeda’s leader older sons who has played some kind of leadership role in the group.

Saad bin Laden spent the first six months of 2002 living in Karachi in southern Pakistan. From there he helped one of his father’s wives, Khairiah bin Laden, and several of his father’s children to move from Pakistan to Iran.

For years these bin Laden family members all lived in the Iranian capital, Tehran, under some form of house arrest. Their conditions were not unpleasant, with time for visits to swimming pools and shopping trips.

Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence learned that some al Qaeda operatives were living in the northern Iranian town of Chalus, on the Caspian Sea.

In 2002 a U.S. Navy SEAL operation into Chalus was planned and then rehearsed somewhere along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Richard Myers, called off the assault because the information about where precisely the al Qaeda members were living in Chalus was not clear.

A year after that operation was called off, according to US and Saudi officials, from his Iranian refuge Saif al-Adel authorized al-Qaeda’s branch in Saudi Arabia to launch a series of terrorist attacks in the Saudi kingdom that began in the capital Riyadh in May 2003, a campaign that killed scores of Saudis and expatriates.

Bergen: Trying bin Laden’s son-in-law in New York makes sense

On the face of it, the fact that a number of al Qaeda leaders and operatives and bin Laden family members found shelter in Iran is puzzling, as the Shia theocrats in the Iranian regime are hostile to the Sunni ultra zealots in al Qaeda, and vice versa.

For al Qaeda’s operatives, life in Iran was more secure than for many of their colleagues in Pakistan who risked capture by Pakistani forces working with the CIA or death by CIA drones.

The Iranian regime likely saw the al Qaeda operatives as useful bargaining chips with the United States in the event of some kind of peace negotiations with the Americans. That peace deal, of course, never happened.

Of course, for Iran the adage, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” may have also come into play, although there doesn’t seem to be evidence that Iran and al Qaeda have ever cooperated on a specific operation.

That said, the 9/11 Commission found that of the 19 hijackers, “8 to 10 of the 14 Saudi “muscle” operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001.” Whether this was with any degree of Iranian complicity is still an open question.

The fact that leading members of al Qaeda were based in Iran from 2002 on was known to the U.S. government at the time. (In fact, in early 2003 counterterrorism officials briefed me about this development).

There is something of an irony here. This was during the same time period in which senior administration officials under President George W. Bush were citing the alleged presence of al Qaeda members in Baghdad and a supposedly burgeoning alliance between al Qaeda and Iraq’s leader Saddam Hussein as a key reason to go to war against Saddam, Iran’s bitter enemy.

Five years after the invasion of Iraq, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded, as had every other official investigation of the matter, that in fact there was no “cooperative relationship” between Saddam and al Qaeda.

In late 2008 al Qaeda operatives kidnapped Heshmatollah Attarzadeh-Niyaki, an Iranian diplomat, in the western Pakistan city of Peshawar.

After holding the diplomat for over a year the militants quietly released him back to Iran in the spring of 2010.

This was part of a deal that allowed some of bin Laden’s family and al Qaeda members living under house arrest in Iran to depart, according to a Pakistani official familiar with the deal.

This deal did not, however, mean that relations between the Iranians and al Qaeda suddenly became all hunky dory.

Documents recovered at bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, following the SEAL raid there on May 1, 2011, and since publicly released portray a rather tense relationship between al Qaeda and the Iranian authorities.

In a letter that bin Laden wrote just five days before he died he described a document from his son Saad who had lived in Iran for years “which exposes the truth of the Iranian regime.” What bin Laden meant precisely by this is not clear, but taken together with some of the other letters that were found in his Abbottabad compound it is obvious that bin Laden and his men were quite distrustful of the Iranian regime.

A letter to bin Laden from his chief of staff dated 11 June 2009 has a detailed account about a group of “mid level” al Qaeda members who the Iranians had recently released, including three Egyptians, a Yemeni, a Iraqi and a Libyan.

Bin Laden’s chief of staff attributed these releases to al Qaeda’s kidnapping of the Iranian diplomat in Peshawar, but added that the Iranians “don’t want to show that they are negotiating with us or reacting to our pressure. … We ask God to repel their evil.”

In another undated letter from bin Laden to his chief off staff al Qaeda’s leader gave a set of detailed instructions about how best to handle his family members living in Iran once they were released.

Bin Laden urged extreme caution “since the Iranians are not to be trusted.” Among another precautions, he wrote that his family members “should be warned about the importance of getting rid of everything they received from Iran like baggage or anything even as small as a needle, as there are eavesdropping chips that have been developed to be so small they can be put inside a medical syringe.”

In this letter bin Laden mentioned by name a number of his children living in Iran including his sons Ladin, Uthman and Muhammad and his daughter Fatima, who is married to Sulaiman Abu Ghaith who now sits in a Manhattan jail.

In October the U.S. Treasury named as terrorists six al Qaeda members living in Iran who it said are funding terrorist activities in Pakistan and sending fighters and money to Syria to fight the Assad regime there.

Abu Ghaith didn’t play an operational role in al Qaeda – a fact that was underlined in the charges filed against him last week in Manhattan that revolve around his role as a propagandist for the group. So it is the precise nature of al Qaeda’s arrangements in Iran and the kind of activities outlined in the recent Treasury designation of the half-dozen al Qaeda members living in Iran that are likely to be of most interest to American investigators.

Given the fact that since 9/11, New York courts have convicted at a rate of 100% in cases that involve members of al Qaeda and associated groups, Abu Ghaith could doubtless cut an attractive plea deal for himself if he gives a full accounting of al Qaeda’s murky decade in Iran.

SEOUL, April 15 (Reuters) - North Korea made new threats of military action on Monday as the reclusive nation celebrated the anniversary of its founder's birth, stoking tension on the peninsula with a new ""ultimatum"" to South Korea in the stand-off over its nuclear program.

The latest statement from Pyongyang followed threats of nuclear attacks on the United States, South Korea and Japan, after new U.N. sanctions were imposed in response to Pyongyang tested a nuclear weapon in February.

""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now,"" North Korea's state news agency KCNA said on Monday, noting actions would ""start immediately.""

The statement was issued by the official North Korean news agency KCNA after signs that Pyongyang may be presenting a less warlike stance on the ""Day of the Sun,"" the date the North's founder Kim Il-Sung was born.

Although many Pyongyang watchers had expected a big military parade to showcase North Korea's armed forces, the day was marked in Pyongyang with a festival of flowers named after Kim.

The United States has offered talks, but on the pre-condition that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. North Korea deems its nuclear arms a ""treasured sword"" and has vowed never to give them up.

Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, ending a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution.

""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang,"" he said. ""North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""

On Sunday evening, Kerry appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearization steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary.

But on Monday White House spokesman Jay Carney said North Korea would have to ""commit itself in a verifiable way to denuclearization"" first, which has long been the U.S. position.

""If North Korea shows that it's serious about pursuing that path, then negotiations are the course through which that can be achieved,"" Carney told reporters.

Earlier, Kerry said he believed China, the North's sole economic and political benefactor, should put ""some teeth"" in efforts to persuade Pyongyang to alter its policies.

The Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, warned on Monday that tensions could get out of control.

""It does not matter if it is intentional or accidental, even the smallest thing could cause the situation to change rapidly and perhaps get totally out of control,"" the paper said.

ON GUARD

South Korean and U.S. officials said last week North Korea appeared set to test-launch a medium-range missile as a show of strength linked to Monday's anniversary of the birth of North Korean state founder Kim Il-Sung.

North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability.

South Korea said it remained on guard against any missile launch and it regretted the North's rejection of an offer of talks made last week by President Park Geun-hye. It said the offer would remain on the table.

Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions, which were expanded after its third nuclear test, in February.

President Barack Obama is under pressure from Republicans in Congress to respond forcefully should North Korea launch a missile.

""I maintain that the United States should treat any North Korean missile launch as a threat to our national security and our allies, and that we should shoot it down once it leaves North Korean airspace,"" said Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who is influential on defense issues.

The aim of the North's aggressive acts, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson of the nation's founder, or to force the United States to hold talks with the North.

The North has also been angry about annual military exercises between U.S. and South Korean forces, describing them as a ""hostile"" act. The United States dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers from their bases to take part.

Yoji Koda, a former commander in chief of the Japanese naval fleet, told Reuters he believed North Korea's threats were part of a ""calculated provocation"", not a prelude to an attack.

He said indications the United States was softening a forceful stance to the North had given its leader Kim Jong-un the opportunity to tone things down.

""This has enabled North Korea to declare victory and sheathe its swords,"" he said.

Kim Il-Sung led his country from its founding in 1948 through the 1950-53 Korean War and until he died in 1994. His son, Kim Jong-il, then took over.

KCNA, the North's news agency, reported that people were flocking to a statue of Kim Il-Sung, saying, ""My father, our great leader"".

""This sincere expression comes from the bottom of their hearts,"" it said.

Kim Jong-un, the third Kim to rule in Pyongyang, attended a midnight celebration of his father's and grandfather's rule with top officials, including his kingmaker uncle Jang Song-thaek.

North Korean defectors said army units were expected to contribute for the celebration of Kim's birthday and in turn, the government, which has struggled to feed its people, had handed out extra rations of rice and corn.

""People are decorating streets for political events. It's never like war time,"" said Seo Jae-pyoung, a defector who lives in South Korea who spoke last week to an acquaintance in the North. ""The government, which normally can't distribute rice, has already given about one week or two week's special rations.""

North Korea has repeatedly stressed that it fears the United States wants to invade it and has manipulated the United Nations to weaken it. During the weekend, the North rejected the overture by new South Korean President Park as a ""cunning"" ploy.

""We will expand in quantity our nuclear weapons capability, which is the treasure of a unified Korea ... that we would never barter at any price,"" Kim Yong-nam, North Korea's titular head of state, told a gathering of officials and service personnel applauding the achievements of Kim Il-Sung.

Obama, before a meeting with congressional leaders and top administration officials at the White House, said he was open to changes in a draft resolution sent to lawmakers over the weekend to authorize a strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad’s military.

He also said he was confident that Congress would ultimately support it.

“This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan,” the president said. “This is a limited, proportional step that will send a clear message not only to the Assad regime but also to other countries that may be interested in testing some of these international norms that there are consequences.”

If the United States were not to act, Obama said, there is a chance that chemical weapons could be transmitted to non-state actors, posing a risk to allies such as Israel, Turkey and Jordan.

It would also, he said, send a message “that international norms around issues like nuclear proliferation don’t mean much.”

The president was meeting with leaders from the House and Senate as well as senior members of Congress’ national security committees.

Tuesday also marks the first public hearing on the administration’s plans, with Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel set to take questions from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the afternoon.

They are also scheduled to go before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, and other administration officials are continuing to brief lawmakers in closed settings.

The president said he was serious about congressional consultation or he would not be calling for a vote, and that he was confident lawmakers were treating the issue with the “soberness and seriousness” it deserved.

Death count for Syrian civil war has passed 100%2C000

U.S.%2C Russia and U.N. working to convene conference to establish transitional government

Uprising against President Bashar Assad%27s rule began in March 2011

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The number of dead in Syria's civil war has passed 100,000, the U.N. chief said Thursday, calling for urgent talks on ending 2½ years of violence even as President Bashar Assad's government blasted the United States as an unsuitable peace broker.

In the latest example of the relentless carnage, a car bomb killed at least 10 people and wounded 66 in a pro-regime, residential area near the capital.

All international attempts to broker a political solution to the Syrian civil war have failed. Despite a stalemate that has settled in for months, both sides still believe they can win the war and have placed impossible conditions for negotiations.

The international community has been unable — and some say, unwilling — to intervene sufficiently to tip the balance in favor of either the Assad regime or the rebels.

""There is no military solution to Syria,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters at the United Nations. ""There is only a political solution, and that will require leadership in order to bring people to the table,"" he said.

He spoke ahead of talks with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said the death toll had risen from nearly 93,000 just over a month ago to more than 100,000. Syrian opposition groups had made that same estimate a month ago.

The uprising against Assad's rule began in March 2011 and deteriorated into an insurgency with growing sectarian overtones.

Ban called on the Syrian government and opposition to halt the violence, saying it is ""imperative to have a peace conference in Geneva as soon as possible.""

The U.S. and Russia are working to convene a conference, along with the United Nations, to try to agree on a transitional government based on a plan adopted in Geneva a year ago.

No official date has been set because the opposition refuses to attend any talks that are not about Assad's departure. Syrian government officials say participation in the conference should be without preconditions, but add that Assad's departure before his term expires in 2014 is not negotiable. Assad has also said he has the right to run for elections again.

Kerry said he talked to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday and that both countries remained committed to bringing the warring parties together to further peace efforts.

""We will try our hardest to make that happen as soon as is possible,"" Kerry said.

The comments at the U.N. appeared at odds with what was happening inside Syria. A U.S. decision to start sending arms to the rebels has further dimmed peace prospects.

The Syrian government criticized the U.S. actions, saying Washington is unsuitable to act as a broker at any peace negotiations.

""Washington's decision to send arms to terrorists in Syria confirms that the American administration is not objective in efforts to find a political solution and hold an international conference in Geneva,"" Syrian state TV said, citing an unidentified Foreign Ministry official. Assad's government routinely refers to opposition fighters as ""terrorists.""

""The American intentions seek to continue the cycle of violence and terrorism in Syria in order to destabilize ... the region,"" the statement said.

The U.S. government opposed providing any lethal assistance to Syria's rebels until last month but is moving ahead now with sending weapons to vetted rebels after securing the approval of the House and Senate Intelligence committees.

President Barack Obama and his national security team have yet to say publicly what weapons they'll provide and when they'll deliver them. There has also been concern in the West that U.S. weapons could end up in the hands of al-Qaida-linked groups.

The Syrian National Coalition, the main Western-backed opposition group, said in a statement that it was committed to ensuring the arms reach only those loyal to the coalition and its affiliated military councils.

The Syrian government has gone on the offensive and has succeeded, with the help of Lebanese Hezbollah militants, in pushing back rebels near Damascus and in central Homs province.

The White House acknowledged that momentum has shifted as Hezbollah and Iran have helped Assad's forces.

The rebels are lashing out with stepped up mortar attacks on Damascus, the seat of Assad's power, and with car bombs that target regime strongholds and security installations.

Thursday's car bomb exploded in Jaramana, a suburb just few kilometers (miles) southeast of Damascus that is overwhelmingly pro-regime.

The state news agency SANA reported that the blast caused heavy damage to nearby buildings and destroyed many cars. TV footage showed mangled cars and heavily damaged residential buildings. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights initially put the death toll at 10 but later raised it to 17, saying several of the wounded had died.

Also Thursday, the Syrian National Coalition cast doubt on a mission by U.N. experts to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons in the civil war.

Both sides accuse each other of using the banned weapons. Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom and U.N. disarmament chief Angela Kane met with Syrian officials Tuesday in Damascus to try to hammer out terms for a possible probe.

The coalition said it was worried the experts would be swayed by Assad, whom they predicted would try to restrict their movements.

Ban said the U.N. team discussed with Syrian officials ""the modalities of investigation.""

""Since they're coming out of Syria now, we'll get the report soon,"" he said.

In Lebanon, a senior Hezbollah official warned European countries that there will be ""repercussions"" to their decision this week to place the group's military wing on the bloc's list of terrorist organizations.

Hezbollah's participation in the Syrian war alongside Assad's forces was among the reasons for the EU decision earlier this week.

Ammar al-Moussawi, head of Hezbollah's foreign relations department, spoke after meeting with Angelina Eichhorst, the EU ambassador to Lebanon. He suggested after the talks that she was not given a warm reception.

""No one can condemn me with one hand, then extend the other to shake hands,"" he told reporters in Beirut after the meeting.

US, Russia wrangle over leaker status","NSA leaker Edward Snowden may be entering a legal gray area as the U.S. and Russia continue to battle over his status as he whiles away the time at the Moscow airport.

WikiLeaks claimed on its Twitter page that a combination of factors -- namely, the revocation of his U.S. passport and an uncertain status with other countries -- could leave Snowden stuck in Moscow.

""Cancelling Snowden's passport and bullying intermediary countries may keep Snowden permanently in Russia. Not the brightest bunch at State,"" the group tweeted.

That scenario seems far-fetched. But at the least, his status poses a challenge to the diplomats and lawyers trying to handle his case on both sides.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell -- asked repeatedly Wednesday about the possibility of Snowden being stuck in travel limbo -- told reporters that one possibility is the U.S. could issue him a document that allows him to take a one-way flight back to the U.S.

""That's the kind of travel document we're prepared to issue an individual accused of serious crimes,"" he said, adding that U.S. officials continue to make the case to the Russians that ""there's a basis"" for his return to the U.S.

He confirmed, though, that Snowden cannot use his invalidated U.S. passport at this point for other visas. The one-way ticket option would likely require Russian cooperation.

While Snowden no longer has a valid U.S. passport, Russian media also reported he may be traveling in Russia on a temporary transit visa.

This creates more questions about his status. A representative with the Russian Embassy in Washington told Fox News that such visas are good for three days -- meaning, if he has one, it would expire on Wednesday. For a stay longer than three days, a traveler is supposed to obtain a tourist visa, something that's supposed to be sought before entering the country.

Snowden's case, however, is far from typical, and it's unclear whether officials would bend the rules to facilitate his movement. Russian media quoted sources as saying the revocation of his U.S. passport is what's really keeping him from moving on -- preventing him from buying a plane ticket or even leaving the airport and setting foot on Russian soil.

WikiLeaks has claimed, though, that Snowden has refugee documents that could allow him -- somehow -- to get to Ecuador, which is still mulling an asylum request, or some other country.

The U.S., meanwhile, continues to pressure Russian officials simply to turn him over to U.S. custody, citing charges brought against Snowden last week. President Vladimir Putin so far has refused, effectively arguing that Snowden is not Russia's problem.

The competing demands and rolling developments in the case paint a picture of a complicated diplomatic tussle with no easily discernible outcome. It has created an embarrassment for the Obama administration, but also challenged relations between the U.S. and other countries, not just Russia.

The U.S. government already was fuming over Hong Kong's decision to let Snowden leave their jurisdiction over the weekend on the flight for Moscow. Adding to the dispute, Hong Kong officials reportedly said Wednesday that the U.S. government listed Snowden's middle name wrong on documents they submitted.

According to The Associated Press, Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen said U.S. documents used the middle name James or the initial J., though their own documents had his middle name as Joseph. He said that helped slow the processing of his arrest, which Snowden ultimately evaded.

However a Justice Department spokesperson said Wednesday, ""that Hong Kong would ask for more information about his identity demonstrates that it was simply trying to create a pretext for not acting on the provisional arrest request.""

A former senior intelligence official told Fox News on Sunday that the Russians could choose to hide behind the ""transit"" route rationale -- claiming Snowden was not formally processed by Russian customs and immigration, and therefore is not in their hands.

However, the intelligence official said Putin was well within his powers to detain Snowden ""in transit,"" and a decision was evidently made not to do so.

Schmidt']",Qaeda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence,"WASHINGTON — As the nation’s spy agencies assess the fallout from disclosures about their surveillance programs, some government analysts and senior officials have made a startling finding: the impact of a leaked terrorist plot by Al Qaeda in August has caused more immediate damage to American counterterrorism efforts than the thousands of classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor.

Since news reports in early August revealed that the United States intercepted messages between Ayman al-Zawahri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as the head of Al Qaeda, and Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the head of the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, discussing an imminent terrorist attack, analysts have detected a sharp drop in the terrorists’ use of a major communications channel that the authorities were monitoring. Since August, senior American officials have been scrambling to find new ways to surveil the electronic messages and conversations of Al Qaeda’s leaders and operatives.

“The switches weren’t turned off, but there has been a real decrease in quality” of communications, said one United States official, who like others quoted spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence programs.

The drop in message traffic after the communication intercepts contrasts with what analysts describe as a far more muted impact on counterterrorism efforts from the disclosures by Mr. Snowden of the broad capabilities of N.S.A. surveillance programs. Instead of terrorists moving away from electronic communications after those disclosures, analysts have detected terrorists mainly talking about the information that Mr. Snowden has disclosed."

At least the latter gentleman knows his own mind, even if paying a high price for it, whereas Obama is at wit’s end to articulate where he stands on the sanctity of democracy and its place in American foreign policy.

Mr. Obama is bound by his own words, international law and the expectations of allies, such as Great Britain, not to acknowledge or support coups that overthrow duly-elected governments. For the president, it is an inconvenient truth that Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, accomplished his office through the ballot box and was as constitutionally legitimate as Obama, but for one small fact.

Morsi pushed through constitutional changes that are rather favorable to the fundamentalist thinking of the Brotherhood. Of course, those views about the desired progress of society and place of religion in the equation are hardly simpatico with the left leaning ideas on Harvard Yard and other American temples of the “progressive” movement.

Like most Americans, I have no truck with the ideas of the Brotherhood, but the mob in the streets objecting to Morsi chose methods other than ballots to remove him. Sadly for him, the Egyptian military is neither under civilian control nor primarily financed by the Egyptian government. It gets its manna from the Obama Administration via more than $1 billion annually in U.S. foreign aid.

Now, the new government, in a fit of liberal tolerance is jailing Brotherhood leaders. And it would seem democracy is accomplishing more progress in U.S. sanctioned Iran than American supported Egypt.

During its recent perils, the Obama White House did not support the elected Egyptian government. It stated the Morsi government must respect the will of all the people, much as the U.S. president did pushing through Obama Care despite the disapproval of the majority of Americans, as expressed through town meetings, polls and a Massachusetts Senate election.

Instead, the U.S. president gave a wink and a nod to a military takeover in Egypt, which the State Department is now indicating may not be a coup, because the generals have not imposed a military leader. Instead, they have put in place as president Egypt’s highest judge, after he was in office but two days. Even if a figurehead, that makes the military removal of a duly-elected Egypt president not a coup, therefore legitimate?

That question has the legal minds at the State Department working overtime.

The upshot, in Egypt Obama’s principal representative, Ambassador Anne Paterson, is vilified by all sides, and the Muslim Brotherhood is likely permanently disabused of the notion that participating in democratic processes can lead to its views taking hold anywhere from Syria to Yemen.

This is a mighty grand mess that will result in untold bloodshed and further reinforce anti-American views across the Middle East. Now, the Arab Spring could easily become pan-Arab anarchy, and much blood will be on American hands. Only a fool would think this situation would not inspire new terrorists.

Those remarkable accomplishments notwithstanding, Americans are entitled to know: What is the U.S. policy toward overthrowing democratically elected governments? Is it unacceptable except when it gives rise to fundamentalist social and religious views the prelates within the American academy and mainstream media don’t like?

Who says America doesn’t have an insular aristocracy and Ayatollahs of its own?

Special for USA TODAY

AMMAN — Concerns that U.S. military intervention in Syria would prop up extremist groups affiliated with al-Qaeda were scoffed at Thursday by leaders of Syria's opponents to dictator Bashar Assad, though analysts warn Islamic extremists are growing.

""The American strikes are not to destroy the rebels, it is to destroy the regime,"" said Hozan Ibrahim, part of the opposition movement that includes the Free Syrian Army.

""Aside from some individual cases, the rebels didn't commit any massacres. And this is not definitely not Iraq, this is not Afghanistan,"" he said. ""There aren't that many extremist groups – yet.""

""Yet"" is the point, analysts say. The longer the conflict drags on, the greater the chance that extremist groups expand in number and influence, said Jane Kinninmont, an analyst at the Chatham House think-tank in London.

""There are al-Qaeda elements active in Syria, although they weren't there at the beginning,"" Kinninmont said.

President Obama's administration insists that the vast majority of rebels in Syria are Sunni Muslims seeking to end a tyranny, not impose Islamic law. But it admits that al-Qaeda loyalists who would do such things are operating in Syria.

""I just don't agree that a majority are al-Qaeda and the bad guys. That's not true. There are about 70,000 to 100,000 oppositionists. ... Maybe 15% to 25% might be in one group or another who are what we would deem to be bad guys,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said this week in testimony before Congress.

""There is a real moderate opposition that exists. Gen. Idriss is running the military arm of that,"" Kerry said in reference to Gen. Salim Idriss, head of the rebel Free Syrian Army that is made up of former Syrian soldiers and others.

He referred to a report from Elizabeth O'Bagy, an analyst with the Institute for the Study of War think-tank, which claimed that Islamic extremist factions are not ""spearheading the fight against the Syrian government,"" but rather that the struggle is being led by ""moderate opposition forces.""

But in rebel-held Aleppo, the BBC reported that a 14-year-old boy was executed in public by Islamists for insulting Islam.

Extremist groups have released videos over the past few months in which they kill locals in towns where they say people have violated Islamic law. Assad said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro that his fight is against terrorists.

""We are fighting terrorists. Eighty to 90% of those we are fighting belong to al-Qaeda. They are not interested in reform or in politics. The only way to deal with them is to annihilate them,"" he said.

Many Syrian fighters believe in some form of Islamic law, not an unusual stance in a Muslim country. But the uprising began in March 2011 as a challenge to the dictatorial policies of Assad, and peaceful demonstrations of Syrians called for democratic change, not Islamic law.

It was not until Assad responded by killing and arresting demonstrators that the opposition movement took up arms.

Kinninmont said the Syrian government has long been sending the message internationally that it is a force for stability and is keeping al-Qaeda and other sectarian ideological groups in check.

""It's quite ironic that the Assad government said that everyone opposed to them is a foreign-backed terrorist and over time, more foreign-backed terrorists have become involved,"" she said

Among the foreign fighters in Syria are groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra, which swears allegiance to al-Qaeda and is designated as a terrorist group by the United States. Also in Syria is the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and jihadists from Chechnya, Pakistan and other countries have answered the call of al-Qaeda to fight Assad.

Al-Qaeda is a Sunni Muslim terror group that seeks to establish Islamic theocracies in all Muslim countries. Its adherents have shown up in many Arab states where uprisings have taken place, such as Yemen, Iraq and Egypt, and attempted to impose its authority.

In Syria, the extremists fight in their own units and sometimes coordinate their operations with the Free Syrian Army. They have taken control of the city of A Raqqa in the north of the country, instituting a council and sharia courts.

These extremist groups are better funded, equipped and trained than local fighters, says the Free Syrian Army, which itself is made up of hundreds of independent units. The extremist fighters have made headway in some areas of Syria such as Idlib province.

As a result, Syrians are leaving areas increasingly affected by extremist clashes for control over strategic areas close to the Iraqi border in droves. Last month, thousands of refugees fled escalating violence between extremist groups and Kurdish militias as well as the Free Syrian Army in northeastern Syria crossing into Iraqi Kurdistan.

Some scoffed at these worries and said they had bigger concerns due to the anticipated military strikes by the United States in retaliation for Assad's alleged gassing of a rebel stronghold with chemical weapons.

""I spent six hours buying bread, I did not find milk for my kids and one kilogram of cheese has doubled in price,"" saidRagheed Mohamed, 42, a father of three in Damascus.

""Mr. Obama has decided to delay the strike -- I am sure he will not do it. But even so, will these prices ever come down?""

That’s how Obama officials are explaining Secretary Kerry’s intense efforts to move Israel onto the front burner and shove over the bloody turmoil immediately affecting millions of Israel’s neighbors and the imminent catastrophe of an Iranian nuclear weapon.

Speaking to reporters on July 30, 2013, senior officials said the administration was seeking “to avoid a train wreck” at the United Nations. “Throughout the course of this year Palestinians have been making clear that if they couldn’t see progress on the peace front, their intention would be to seek other elevations of their status… at the UN.” They explained a “new dynamic vis-à-vis the United Nations,” was driving the immediacy for renewed talks.

The comments mirror Secretary Kerry’s remarks in June: “the Palestinians have said that they will go to the UN and seek to join more UN organizations… And the Palestinians have also threatened to take their case to the International Criminal Court.”

Now Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has generously promised to delay those moves during the next nine months of talks.

The claim that the United Nations – and more specifically, the Arab stranglehold over its output – is genuinely intimidating the President of the United States ought to ring major alarm bells for anyone under the impression that elected American representatives set American foreign policy.

So how true is it?

The new faux peace negotiations between Israel and a Palestinian leader who doesn’t control the land or the people he purports to represent follow months of hysterical pressure from UN quarters.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on June 3, 2013 in Washington: “We are approaching a point of no return in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict… This may well be the last chance for the two-State solution.” On June 18, 2013, Ban told a UN Palestinian committee meeting in Beijing: “I cannot stress enough the risk of missing the current window of opportunity.”

No doubt the UN’s goal has been to remove Arabs murdering other Arabs from the top spot on newswires around the world and replace it with stories about Jews constructing apartment buildings.

But the UN noise-making has been neatly dovetailing with the noises coming from Secretary Kerry, who told the Foreign Affairs Committee on April 17, 2013: “I believe the window for a two-state solution is shutting… We have… a year, a year and a half to two years–or it’s over.” On June 3, 2013, he said: “We’re running out of time… [I]f we do not succeed now, we may not get another chance.” Events, he said, “could literally slam the door on a two-state solution.”

As Kerry worked over Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, periodic announcements issued forth from the UN Secretary-General, such as: “We all need to support Secretary of State Kerry’s courageous initiative.”

From a UN perspective, the drumbeating makes perfect sense. Settled (and fatuous) UN policy has long been that “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” lies at the heart of the failure to deliver world peace. And the nub of that conflict, as Ban Ki-moon repeated in June, was “the occupation, now nearing half a century.” Even the nomenclature of the “Arab-Israeli conflict,” alluding in part to 65 years of Arab rejection of the Jewish state, has been quietly retired.

But what about the American perspective?

When the Palestinians threaten to use the United Nations to act unilaterally, that is a violation of their obligations under the UN’s own Security Council-endorsed Middle East Road Map which demands a negotiated settlement. The supposed Palestinian “gift” of not using the UN to orchestrate another end run around negotiations is really not giving anything at all. It is reneging on the outcome of prior negotiations.

Actually, those prior agreements were already broken by the Palestinians last year. In the fall of 2012 the Palestinians stage-managed a UN spectacle in which they renamed themselves “the state of Palestine” and acquired the status of UN “non-member observer state.” Instead of a major negative response from President Obama, however, they achieved just the opposite.

The administration has been doing its damnedest to get Congress to annul the negative financial fallout experienced merely by the UN agency UNESCO. On every other front, U.S. dollars have just kept flowing, and it is diplomatic business as usual. In fact, the ransom floated before Palestinians grew. In April, Kerry gushed about an economic strategy for Palestinians that would “involve the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corp., and U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as American corporations.”

The Palestinians got the message: using the UN was a huge success. President Obama and Secretary Kerry were sufficiently cowed by the prospect of more unilateral UN undertakings that the only possible next step was to come down hard on Israel and force it to release convicted Palestinian murderers from Israeli prisons. A hundred are due to be set free in “exchange” for the Palestinians hitting the UN-pause button.

So let’s get this twisted tale straight. Palestinians have magnanimously agreed not to pursue unilateral UN actions – in direct contravention of their previous promises – and not to attempt to prosecute Israel at the “neutral” International Criminal Court (whose statute has a provision written specifically to target Israel). And the Obama administration pretends it is doing Israel a favor by bringing the Palestinians to the table because Washington’s hands are tied by the UN. That would be the same UN that is dependent on American taxpayer dollars for its next breath.

The reality looks more like this.

The UN and the Palestinians are doing exactly what the President of the United States and his Secretary of State want. Set aside crimes against humanity in Syria. Millions of Egyptians on the streets can wait. Iran’s next terror victims can forget about it.

Just like UN Israel-haters have always said, it turns out that this American administration also believes that Israel is the root cause of the world’s problems. Bludgeoning Israel is the UN’s – and President Obama’s – game.

Israeli Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to end Iran%27s ability to make a nuclear bomb

Friction between U.S. and Israel is high

Economic sanctions are also at issue

JERUSALEM — The United States vowed Monday it would not cave to Iran in negotiations over the Islamic republic's nuclear program despite charges from Israel and France that negotiators were proposing to let Iran maintain its nuclear capacity.

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro vowed Monday that President Obama would not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons and that the United States would not sign on to a ""bad deal"" at negotiations with Iran tipped to restart later this month.

Speaking at the Jewish Federations of North American General Assembly in Jerusalem, Shapiro drove home his point by repeating it in Hebrew, according to the Jerusalem Post.

He said that the U.S. would not ""squander"" the leverage of Western economic sanctions on Iran, which wants those sanctions removed. Shapiro said that no deal on Iran's atomic program would be better than a bad deal.

His comments came as the United Nations' nuclear chief reached a deal Monday to allow expanded monitoring of Iran's nuclear sites, including at a planned reactor, but not an agreement to dismantle its ability to make material for nuclear weapons as the U.N. Security Council has demanded.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday again defended U.S. efforts with Iran, saying that the major powers were unified on an Iran nuclear deal during weekend talks in Geneva but the Iranians did not accept it.

Speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi, Kerry lashed out at opponents to the proposal. Among them are Israeli Prime MInister Benjamin Netanyahu, who told Kerry on Friday that the proposed deal gave Iran all it wants on sanctions and did nothing to end Iran's ability to make a nuclear bomb.

""The time to oppose it is when you see what it is, not to oppose the effort to find out what is possible,"" Kerry said. ""We are confident that what we are doing can actually protect Israel more effectively and provide greater security.""

Kerry's statement appeared to contradict the stance of French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, who told France Inter radio that Paris would not accept what he called a ""sucker's deal."" France announced over the weekend that it did not support the proposal backed by the United States because it did not adequately address security concerns of Iran's neighbor

That was the reason given by Netanyahu for his opposition to the proposal. Not waiting for the proposal to be announced by Kerry as a done deal, Netanyahu, apparently aware of the contours of the proposal, came out publicly to say it would imperil its very existence because it did not guarantee the end of Iran's nuclear bomb capabilities.

Analysts say it was unusual for the allies to be so public with their complaints about one another and it shows relations with Israel have never been more frayed in recent memory.

""If there were a synoptic map for diplomatic storms, the National Weather Service would be putting out a hurricane warning right now,"" said Haaretz diplomatic correspondent Chemi Shalev. ""And given that the turbulence is being caused by an issue long deemed to be critical to Israel's very existence, we may actually be facing a rare Category 5 flare-up, a 'superstorm' of U.S.-Israeli relations.""

Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. peace negotiator who has advised Democratic and Republican secretaries of State, said the rift may cause problems for the United States on multiple fronts, including a risk of dragging the United States into war with Iran.

""How this will play out is not clear,"" Miller said. ""I find it almost unimaginable this administration would conclude even an interim agreement with (Iranian President Hassan) Rouhani that left Israel angry and aggrieved and the relationship in even worse shape.""

Miller said Israeli frustration with the United States may have been greater at points in the past but he'd never seen Israeli ire expressed as publicly as has been done in recent days by Netanyahu. Headlines in the Israeli press seem to agree.

The United States has been pushing for a deal in talks in Geneva to end a standoff between Iran and the West over a nuclear program that the U.S. suspects is aimed at making an atomic bomb, a possibility that Israel considers a threat to its existence.

The Iranian question is just the latest issue to severely fray relations between Israel and the United States in recent months, along with the U.S. decision to tackle Syria's chemical weapons with diplomacy, and Obama's emphasis on the Israeli-Palestinian standoff as being the major problem facing the Middle East.

Israel complains that an increasingly radicalized Syria, the spread of Islamist ideology in Egypt and elsewhere, and a nuclear bomb in the hands of what Netanyahu has called ""Islamofascist fanatics"" in Iran are the real problems for the world in the Middle East.

Jonathan Rynhold, a senior researcher at Bar Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, said the ""crisis of trust"" isn't just between Israel and the U.S. Most Middle East countries, he said, believe that a nuclear-armed Iran ""would undermine the balance of power that has served everyone so well over the years.""

If Iran becomes ""a nuclear threshold"" state, ""Saudi Arabia will quickly obtain nuclear weapons from Pakistan,"" which reportedly developed its own nuclear weapons with help from the Saudis, Rynhold said.

""Egypt is already looking to Russia to supply it with conventional weapons and will, no doubt, seek to obtain nuclear capability, as will Turkey.""

The breakdown over Iran came amid the extraordinary public barbs between the two longtime allies.

After meeting with Netanyahu on Friday, Kerry also told Israel's Channel 2 TV that Israel faced possible international isolation and violence with the Palestinians if his attempt to broker a peace deal for a Palestinian state failed.

An agitated Netanyahu lashed back that ""no amount of pressure"" would make Israel compromise on its basic security and national interests. He said the world had ignored Palestinian incitement and a refusal to accept Israel as a Jewish state, and that the West has acquiesced half-hearted Palestinian attempts to fight violence.

""It's time that the international community, certainly the serious members of the international community, understand this is a two-way street, because peace is not a one-way street and it won't be,"" he said.

On Sunday it continued, with Netanyahu disclosing to his Cabinet he told Kerry in private that Israel would not wait to see what deal emerged with Iran and would continue to lobby European leaders to stop it unless it ended Iran's program.

His stance had already prompted a personal call from Obama on Friday, and a high-ranking delegation of U.S. officials led by Wendy Sherman, U.S. undersecretary for political affairs arrived in Israel, on Sunday to talk to Netanyahu on the negotiations, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper.

Israel says it's mystified by the foreign policy of the United States.

Netanyahu on Sunday said he was telling Western leaders that the proposed deal was dangerous for the world and the USA, not just Israel. He insisted to CBS' Face the Nation that the purpose of the Geneva negotiations is to get Iran to bend to the will of the U.N. Security Council demand that it remove the technology and material used for making a possible bomb.

""I'm expressing not only the concerns of Israel but the concerns of many in the region,"" he said. ""I asked the leaders, what is the rush?""

Naftali Bennett, a member of Netanyahu's security Cabinet, said Sunday that the way forward is to not lessen economic sanctions on Iran as the U.S-backed proposal would do, but to strengthen them. He suggested the Obama administration was backing off its original stand just so Iran will sign on to any agreement, and he praised other nations for opposing it.

""The deal needs to be the original deal which dismantles Iran's entire war machine,"" he told Fox News. ""Fortunately, France and other countries stopped this train.""

Netanyahu said he was actively lobbying leaders of Russia, France, Britain and Germany not reach a hasty deal, as well as the United States.

Iran state TV lashed out at opponents, describing France as being Israel's ""representative"" at the talks. Reuters reported Sunday that a Twitter account believed run by the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: ""French officials have been openly hostile towards the Iranian nation over the past few years; this is an imprudent and inept move.""

The sticking points, say European negotiators such as France, is whether to demand a shutdown of a reactor that could produce weapons-grade nuclear fuel, what to do about Iran's stockpile of higher-enriched uranium, and how much relief from economic sanctions to give to Tehran before it does anything to its program.

Israel has made it clear that the world will only be safe if the West insists that Iran eradicate, not stall, its ability to develop nuclear weapons.

""We need to keep up the pressure on Iran to avoid a physical attack on Iran,"" Bennett said, referring to a possible military strike to stop Iran's nuclear program. ""Now is the time to prevent a nuclear 9/11.""

Former U.S. negotiator Miller agrees that the rift between the United States and Israel may have serious consequences, and soon. The frayed relationship makes it harder to gain Israeli backing for a final deal with Iran and to prevent a unilateral Israeli military strike.

Such a strike, with or without Obama's approval, would hike oil prices and threaten the U.S. economy, Miller said. And with the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet based in the Persian Gulf, it could cause the USA to be ""dragged in and required to respond"" to an Iranian counterattack, he said.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., warned that the president's Israel policies – allowing Iran to dominate in Syria, insisting on a Palestinian state while the region is in turmoil, and offering Iran a deal that Israel clearly opposes – shows Obama and Kerry to be unsympathetic to Israeli security needs.

Iran's nuclear capability ""is truly an existential threat to Israel,"" and Obama ""has ignored Israel's realities,"" Franks said.

(CNN) —

Could Israel be considering a momentous concession that would change the course of 46 years of history with the Palestinians?

A news report, a show of goodwill and diplomatic murmurs by the United States and its Arab partners are stoking hopes that a glacial budge in Israel’s position could lead Israelis and Palestinians to talk seriously about peace again.

Reuters news agency quoted an Israeli official last week who said Israel agreed to a plan for peace talks based on pre-1967 borders and land swaps.

It is something the United Nations demanded in a resolution in 1967 and has been the gold standard of yearnings for Middle East peace ever since. It requires Israel to withdraw from occupied territories completely and the Palestinians to recognize the existence of an Israeli state.

Israel to free Palestinian prisoners as deal to resume peace talks emerges

Israel denies report

Israel’s public relations apparatus immediately denied the report. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s spokesman Mark Regev told CNN on Saturday he could not imagine who in the government would say something like that.

But on the same day, Israel announced it would unilaterally release a number of Palestinian prisoners in a gesture of goodwill, given the prospects for new talks.

“As the negotiations proceed, Israel agrees to free, as a goodwill gesture, a limited number of prisoners during the period of the negotiations,” said Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs. It is not yet clear how many prisoners will be released and who they will be.

Whatever the magic ingredient is that could be drawing Israel and the Palestinians to the negotiating table, all parties involved are holding their tongues about it.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry wants people to stop guessing what it is.

“Any speculation or reports you may read in the media … are conjecture … because the people who know the facts are not talking about them,” he said.

He said he will say something when the time is right – side by side with the appropriate leaders.

Those will likely be Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

Kerry praised their “courageous leadership,” saying they had chosen to make difficult decisions.

It “establishes a basis for resuming direct final status negotiations between” Palestinians and Israel, Kerry said Friday from Jordan.

And they could happen fast. The two sides will join him in Washington “for initial talks within the next week or so” if things keep working out, Kerry said.

Palestinian officials surprised

Developments have come so rapidly that they have caught Palestinian leaders around Abbas off guard, said a senior Palestinian official who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.

The officials are asking for guarantees and have lots of questions.

For some, hope is mixed with pessimism built up through decades of futile negotiations and bloody relations between Israelis and Palestinians.

Talks “are bound to fail sooner than later” if there is no commitment to clear terms, such as a freeze on Israeli settlements in occupied territory, said Mustafa Barghouti, a prominent Palestinian legislator and head of a political party.

A sporting push for peace in Israeli-Palestinian relations

Israeli reaction

On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke as though peace talks were definite.

“These will not be easy negotiations,” he said as he opened a Cabinet meeting. “We will enter into them with integrity, sincerity and the hope that this process will be conducted responsibly.”

Israel’s defense minister said Saturday that his government wants to waste no time getting started with the peace talks.

“We are getting to the negotiations with clean hands and great desire to get to an arrangement that will end the conflict,” Moshe Ya’alon said.

Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni lauded the prospect of peace in a statement.

“Four years of political stagnation are coming to an end,” she said.

Understanding 1967

To understand the excitement over the rumored concessions – if they are indeed a possibility – one needs to go back to the dawn of the Six-Day War.

In June 1967, Egypt, Syria and Jordan massed their troops on Israel’s borders in preparation for an all-out attack.

Israel launched a pre-emptive strike on June 5, targeting Arab airfields and destroying the Egyptian air force on the ground.

Mideast 101: The Six-Day War

Egypt had set up a sea blockade against Israel the day before, according to the U.S. State Department Office of the Historian.

Military skirmishes and bellicose gestures between Israel and many of its Arab neighbors had reached a crescendo. Syria threatened to push Israel into the sea. Egypt allied with the Syrians.

Israel captured lands from its enemies and occupied them.

Maps, land and history: Why 1967 still matters

The United Nations demanded in Security Council Resolution 242 that Israeli troops withdraw and give the lands back. The resolution required all states involved to recognize each other’s existence.

At first, Arab countries refused to recognize Israel as a state, and Israel retained the captured territory.

Over time, things changed. Egypt and Israel made peace in a deal brokered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Camp David in 1978, and Israel handed the largest captured chunk, the Sinai Peninsula, back to Egypt.

Jordan and Israel mended relations.

Israel withdrew from Gaza, bulldozing its former settlements on its way out.

But it has hung on to the West Bank, and the Palestinians have refused to recognize Israel as a state.

After decades of waiting, many hold out hope that new negotiations could ultimately bring about a resolution.

The military said its squadrons practiced refueling planes in midair this week and tested the air force's ability. The accompanying footage shows a tanker plane refueling a fighter jet midair, a key part of any long-range operation.

The release of the video comes just days before Western powers are to open new talks with Iran over its disputed nuclear program.

The U.S. and its allies accuse Iran of using its civilian nuclear program as a cover to develop nuclear weapons. Israel has repeatedly warned that it would be willing to take military action if necessary to stop Iran from going nuclear.

The talks on Iran's nuclear program will be held next week with the five permanent U.N. Security Council members — the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France — plus Germany, collectively known as the P5+1.

President Barack Obama disclosed in an interview with The Associated Press last Friday that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iran continues to be a year or more away from building a nuclear weapon, in contrast to Israel's assessment that Tehran is closer.

In recent speeches, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned against letting Iran drag the world along for talks while it continues to pursue a bomb. He's been on a media blitz of late to warn the West against President Hassan Rouhani's softer tone, which he dismissed as a trick aimed at removing crippling economic sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear program.

Israeli military officials said the drill took place over Greece, a key regional ally. The military has done similar drills in the past but releasing the footage appears aimed at sending a message to Iran before the talks that a viable military options remains.

Israel views a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its very existence, citing Iran's repeated calls for Israel's destruction, its long-range missile program and its support for violent anti-Israel groups like the Hezbollah in Lebanon."

* Lawmakers have broad array of concerns

* Heated debate expected when Congress returns Sept. 9

* Kerry warns lawmakers of risk to Israel

By Matt Spetalnick and Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and his top aides launched a full-scale political offensive on Sunday to persuade a skeptical Congress to approve a military strike against Syria, but faced an uphill struggle to win over many lawmakers and a war-weary American public.

Obama made a series of calls to members of the House of Representatives and Senate, with more scheduled for Monday, underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the Syrian government.

Dozens of lawmakers, some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves, cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the Capitol building for a Sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on Syria with Obama's national security team.

When they emerged nearly three hours later, there was no immediate sign that the many skeptics in Congress had changed their minds.

""I am very concerned about taking America into another war against a country that hasn't attacked us,"" said Representative Janice Hahn, a California Democrat. On the way out of the briefing, she said the participants appeared ""evenly divided"" on whether to give Obama approval.

None expressed doubts that Syria had engaged in chemical warfare. ""The searing image of babies lined up dead, that's what I can't get out of my mind right now,"" Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz said after the closed-door briefing.

But the credibility of the administration's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response.

Earlier in the day, Secretary of State John Kerry invoked the crimes of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and warned of a potential threat to Israel a day after Obama's decision to delay an imminent attack on Syrian targets and allow Congress to vote on it first.

Even as Kerry took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the Aug. 21 chemical attack near Damascus, the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent.

Lawmakers raised a broad array of concerns, including the potential effectiveness of limited strikes, the possible unintended consequence of dragging the United States into another open-ended Middle East conflict, the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden and the war fatigue of the American public.

Many in Congress have been able to avoid taking a position on the merits of a military strike, focusing instead on demands that Obama consult them and seek their approval.

While Kerry predicted Obama would win the endorsement he wants, a growing cacophony of congressional critics - ranging from liberal Democratic doves to Republican Tea Party conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be.

At the same time, Kerry, the administration's most impassioned voice for intervention in Syria's 2-1/2-year civil war, was left to publicly defend Obama's stunning reversal, a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days.

""This is squarely now in the hands of Congress,"" Kerry told CNN, saying he had confidence ""they will do what is right because they understand the stakes.""

In a round of television appearances, Kerry declined to say whether Obama would go ahead with military action if Congress rejects the president's request, as Britain's parliament did last week to derail London's role in any Syria military operation.

But, echoing Obama's comments in the White House Rose Garden on Saturday, he insisted the president had the right to act on his own if he chooses that course.

Obama is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault that he considers essential to maintain U.S. credibility after Assad crossed the ""red line"" set against the use of chemical weapons.

MORE EVIDENCE

The consensus on Capitol Hill is that Obama has a good chance of winning approval in the Democratic-led Senate, but the vote appears too close to call in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where the president's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him.

Acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out for it to persuade some lawmakers, Kerry insisted they could not ""have it both ways"" by demanding a voice in the matter and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use.

Kerry used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the Syrian government.

""I can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody, from east Damascus, from first responders, it has tested positive for signatures of sarin,"" Kerry told CNN's ""State of the Union.""

It was the first time the administration had pinpointed what kind of chemical was used in the attack on a rebel-held area, which U.S. intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children.

""So this case is building and this case will build,"" Kerry told CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

OBAMA'S DILEMMA

Obama's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional Republicans. Another bitter face-off on government spending is looming this autumn.

Lawmakers for the most part welcomed Obama's decision to consult them, but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess, which lasts until Sept. 9.

Comments from leading Republicans and Democrats indicated how complex the debate will be - and raised doubts whether Obama would win their authorization.

Underscoring a sense of wariness even from Obama's traditional allies, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said the Vermont Democrat believes that the use-of-force resolution offered by the White House is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration.

Mike Rogers, Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN: ""I think there are some real challenges. I think that at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion. This is a national security issue.""

Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, speaking on NBC, took a more skeptical view.

While saying he was ""proud"" of Obama for coming to Congress for authority, Paul said, ""It's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down the involvement in the Syrian war.""

""I think the Senate will rubber stamp what he wants,"" he said. ""The House will be a much closer vote."" The Senate is controlled by Obama's Democratic Party, the House is in the hands of the Republican Party.

Republican Senator John McCain said he was not sure Obama's request would pass, but made clear his view that tougher military action was needed than the limited cruise missile strikes that the Obama administration is preparing.

Republican Representative Peter King of New York said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on Syria, but he warned Obama may have to overcome ""the isolationist wing"" of the Republican Party to prevail.

Seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate, Kerry tipped his hand on one tactic the administration will use - linking the congressional vote to safeguarding U.S. ally Israel from the Syrian chemical weapons threat.

""I don't think they will want to vote, ultimately, to put Israel at risk,"" Kerry said.

Lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of Israel, especially at election time, when they compete to show voters who is a better friend of the Jewish state.

Both chambers of Congress are on recess, and many of their members are far from Washington. But the distance did not stop some of them from responding to President Obama’s statement on Saturday afternoon that he would seek Congressional authorization before launching a military strike in response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons. Many representatives and senators took to Twitter with their reactions.

Some lawmakers expressed gratitude for the president’s announcement that he would wait for them to debate and vote on a strike, including Representatives Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, and Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York.

Good decision by the President! He will seek our approval!! Thank you! — Billy Long (@auctnr1) 31 Aug 13

I applaud President Obama’s decision to request authorization from Congress prior to the use of force in Syria. — Yvette D. Clarke (@YvetteClarke) 31 Aug 13

Others offered more measured words for the president, reflecting controversies over the extent of the executive branch’s powers. Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, who has taken a leading role in debates over government surveillance, summed up his gratitude this way:

It’s unfortunate that it’s gotten to the point where I have to thank the President for following the Constitution & the law. — Justin Amash (@repjustinamash) 31 Aug 13

And at least one congressman, Representative Randy Weber, a Republican who filled Ron Paul’s seat in Texas, used Twitter to solicit opinions on the president’s statement:

The President is calling for Congressional action on #Syria. Tell me what you think… — Randy Weber (@TXRandy14) 31 Aug 13

One question that remained unresolved was when Congress would debate and vote. With Congress out of session until Sept. 9, several lawmakers expressed their willingness to return early:

I’ve been urging Speaker to call us back into session — it is essential that we be called back into session immediately. #Syria — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) 31 Aug 13

http://news.yahoo.com/us-runs-resistance-over-strike-syria-214642532--politics.html,,[],US runs into resistance over strike on Syria,"PARIS (AP) — The U.S. tried to rally support on Saturday for a military strike against Syria, running into resistance from the American public and skeptics in Congress and from European allies bent on awaiting a U.N. report about a chemical attack they acknowledge strongly points to the Assad government.

President Barack Obama prepared for a national address Tuesday night as a growing number of lawmakers, including fellow Democrats, opposed the use of force. The American public didn't yet appear persuaded by Obama's argument that action is needed to deter the future use of chemical weapons. Meanwhile, a U.S. official released a DVD compilation of videos showing victims of the Aug. 21 attack near Damascus.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who met with more than two dozen European foreign ministers on Saturday, insisted that international backing to take strong action against Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime was growing, not receding.

Kerry noted that the ministers, who held an informal meeting of the European Union in Vilnius, Lithuania, made powerful statements condemning the attack, and that increasingly there was a sense of conviction that Assad was to blame. Kerry said the U.S. had agreed to provide additional information to those ministers who were not yet convinced that Assad orchestrated the attack.

The EU endorsed a ""clear and strong response"" to a chemical weapons attack but didn't indicate what type of response they were backing. It also said that evidence strongly points to the Syrian government. Still, the EU urged the U.S. to delay possible military action until U.N. inspectors report their findings.

The Europeans were divided on whether military action would be effective. Britain's Parliament has voted against military action. France had been ready to act last week but held off when Obama declared that he would seek the backing of Congress. French President Francois Hollande's announcement appeared to catch French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius off guard.

Story continues

Earlier on Friday, Fabius told EU foreign ministers that there was no need to wait for the U.N. report because it would simply confirm what was already known — that the chemical weapons attack had occurred — but would not say who was responsible.

Hollande indicated Saturday that the U.N. report could be ready in a matter of days, and he would then be prepared to make a decision on a French intervention.

""I said ... that I wanted to wait for the inspectors' report, which I know will be ready within a very reasonable time period, that is, not that far from the decision of the U.S. Congress,"" he told French television after meeting with Lebanese President Michel Suleiman in Nice, France. ""So, at that moment, I'll have all the necessary elements that will let me tell the French people the decision I have made for France.""

However, Martin Nesirky, chief U.N. spokesman, insisted that there would be no preliminary report.

The report on the Aug. 21 attack will be given to the U.N. Security Council and other member states once the lab analysis is complete, Nesirky said.

""We are not saying when that will be, except as soon as feasible,"" he told The Associated Press. ""This is a scientific timeline, not a political timeline.""

Kerry traveled Saturday from Lithuania to Paris to meet with French official and representatives of the Arab League. He joined French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius in hailing the EU statement.

""Some don't believe in taking military action ever at all,"" Kerry said. ""And some want to wait for one thing or another, but the overwhelming support is moving in the direction of holding the Assad regime accountable.""

Kerry added: ""This is growing, not receding in terms of the global sense of outrage of what has happened.""

Fabius said if no action were taken, there would be little hope for a political solution to the crisis.

Obama and other administration officials were preparing a dayslong push to gain public and congressional support for a strike on Syria. Obama himself was to sit down Monday for interviews with a half-dozen broadcast and cable networks.

The challenges they faced were apparent Saturday. Sen. Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat facing a tough bid for a third term, said he would oppose military action, and at least 150 people picketed outside the White House against Obama's request.

Pryor said in a statement that the administration had not met his criteria for gaining his support: a compelling national security interest, a clearly defined mission with a definitive end, and a coalition of allies.

""Unless there's some new information or some new development or circumstance, I just don't see me changing my vote at this point,"" he told The Associated Press in an interview.

Protesters at the White House, chanting ""They say more war; we say no war,"" said their picket line marked a line Congress should not cross as it prepared to vote on the issue. Demonstrations also took place in New York City, Boston and Indianapolis and in Louisiana and Michigan.

In Britain, an anti-regime monitor of the fighting in Syria says it has been compiling a list of the names of the dead from the Aug. 21 attack and that its toll has reached 502. The Obama administration reported 1,429 people died, including 426 children, citing intelligence reports. The Assad government blames opposition forces for the deaths.

""Punishment is not at odds with a political solution,"" Fabius said. ""Bashar Assad will not participate in any negotiation as long as he believes himself to be invincible.""

Saturday's developments left both the U.S. and Europeans in a waiting game.

While the Europeans awaited the U.N. inspection report, the Obama administration waited to see if Congress would back a use of force. Meantime, administration officials continued to lobby lawmakers by phone to vote to authorize a limited military strike against the Assad regime.

The first Senate vote, expected Wednesday, was likely to be on a resolution authorizing the ""limited and specified use"" of U.S. armed forces against Syria for no more than 90 days and barring American ground troops from combat. A final vote in the 100-member chamber was expected at week's end.

A House vote is likely the week of Sept. 16.

Asked about the American public's uneasiness about getting involved in another conflict, Kerry reiterated his view that the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict was a threat to the U.S.

""This case has not yet been made to the American people for more than a few days and we will continue to make the case to the American people,"" Kerry said in Paris. ""This concerns ever American's security.""

The DVD compilation of videos of victims of the gas attack near Damascus was shown to senators during a classified briefing on Thursday, and some of the videos were first broadcast Saturday on CNN. Supporters of the Syrian rebels had posted the videos on YouTube.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein of California requested the material from the CIA, and members of her committee watched the videos on Thursday. The DVD is a compilation of footage of victims of the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of the Syrian capital of Damasacus that were posted on YouTube by supporters of the Syrian rebels.

The U.S. official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the subject of a classified briefing, said the videos were also referenced in the government's four-page intelligence assessment, released last week, that blamed the Syrian government for the chemical attack.

Yemeni officials says al-Qaeda’s branch in the country is focusing on expanding its presence in a remote eastern province that is the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden. (MOHAMMED HUWAIS/AFP/Getty Images)

Al-Qaeda’s branch in Yemen is focusing on expanding its presence in a remote eastern province that is the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, even as the group remains the target of U.S. drone strikes and Yemeni military assaults, according to Yemeni officials.

Last year, a U.S.-backed Yemeni military offensive drove the militants from the southern province of Abyan, which the fighters had seized during the Arab Spring revolt in the country and controlled for more than a year as they sought to create an Islamic emirate from which to attack the Yemeni government and Western targets.

But in recent months, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, as the affiliate is known, has bolstered its presence in Hadramaut, the country’s largest province. Hadramaut — which some scholars say roughly translates as “Death is among us” — abuts Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally.

“After the ousting of al-Qaeda from Abyan and the fleeing of the armed militants to different areas, it seems that al-Qaeda has shifted its attention toward Hadramaut,” said Ali Alsarari, a political adviser to Yemen’s prime minister, Mohammed Basindwa. “They control some areas and are trying to do what they did in Abyan.”

AQAP’s ambition of creating a new haven in Yemen was underscored this week as the Yemeni government announced that it had foiled a plot by the group to seize Mukalla, the capital of Hadramaut and a vital seaport, and to destroy an oil pipeline and gas facilities. It was the first time, officials said, that AQAP had tried to take over Mukalla.

“It surprised us that they would try to seize the city,” said Rajeh Badi, a spokesman for Basindwa.

The group’s new boldness comes as its ties to al-Qaeda’s central branch in Pakistan and its profile in jihadist circles are growing. AQAP leader Nasir al-Wuhayshi, once bin Laden’s personal secretary, is the terrorist network’s No. 2 leader, after Ayman al-Zawahiri, according to analysts.

The interception last week of a discussion between the two al-Qaeda leaders of a potential attack on Western targets prompted the closure of 19 U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and Africa, as well as a global travel alert. The State Department this week evacuated non-emergency personnel from its embassy in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Although the port and pipeline raids were thwarted, U.S. officials said they remain on alert because they think the plot might have been part of a broader plan.

“It’s possible that the plot has been delayed, but the concern remains that AQAP has something in the works,” said a U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Drone campaign

The Obama administration considers AQAP among the greatest threats to the United States. The group sent parcel bombs on flights into the United States in 2010 and orchestrated a foiled plot to bomb an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. In response, the administration unleashed a campaign of drone strikes across southern and eastern Yemen that has killed AQAP militants but also bred anger and fostered sympathy for the group among many Yemenis.

In light of the growing criticism, the administration had cut back on drone attacks this year. Recently, however, the pace has intensified. On Thursday, two U.S. drone strikes killed nine suspected militants, the Associated Press quoted Yemeni military officials as saying. They were the sixth and seventh such attacks in less than two weeks. Since July 27, drone attacks have killed 31 suspected militants, according to an AP count of the dead based on details provided by Yemeni security officials.

Over the past year, Hadramaut has been a target of airstrikes. From mid-May to December last year, there were seven U.S. drone strikes in the province — about 17 percent of the total such raids in Yemen in 2012, according to the Long War Journal, a Web site that monitors drone attacks. Before May 2012, there were no strikes in Hadramaut. Last week, a strike in the province killed five alleged AQAP militants, according to the Web site.

Portions of Hadramaut have been AQAP bastions for several years, but what is new is the group’s effort to make the province its main stronghold, said Alsarari and other Yemeni officials. Hadramaut, which covers a third of Yemen, is one of the poorest and most geographically inhospitable regions in the Arabian Peninsula, and the highly conservative tribal society there practices a strict form of Islam. Such conditions help AQAP win recruits and sympathy.

Moreover, bin Laden’s clan hails from a region of Hadramaut where clan and tribal loyalties trump national identity, allowing greater protection and shelter for AQAP fighters. The province’s proximity to Saudi Arabia also allows for free flows of militants: AQAP was formed from the merger of al-Qaeda’s Yemeni and Saudi branches in January 2009.

Saleh’s shadow

Yemeni officials insist that AQAP’s takeover of Abyan will not be replicated in Hadramaut, saying that the political and military climate is different now. In 2011, Islamist militants linked to AQAP took advantage of the country’s political turmoil amid the populist uprising and seized control of large swaths of the south, especially Abyan.

The ease of that takeover prompted critics of then-

President Ali Abdullah Saleh to accuse him of purposely losing territory as a tactic to convince the United States, neighboring countries and other allies that instability would result if he stepped down. Saleh’s government had a mixed record on combating extremist groups, sometimes aligning with them to gain power or leverage aid from the West.

After Saleh left office last year under pressure from the United States and neighboring Arab countries, his handpicked successor, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, launched a major U.S.-backed offensive against the militants and pushed them out of Abyan. Many of the fighters scattered across several provinces, including Hadramaut, while others launched a shadowy insurgency, striking Yemeni military, security and government targets.

Today, Yemeni military officials say they are engaged in a tit-for-tat guerrilla conflict. “As a Yemeni proverb says, ‘One day for you and the other against you,’ ” said Brig. Gen. Ali Saeed Obaid, deputy chief of the general staff in the Defense Ministry. Cooperation with the United States, he added, is closer than ever, and the U.S. drones are a key tool for the Yemeni military.

Last week, Hadi visited the White House to discuss the U.S.-Yemeni efforts to combat the militants, as well as other bilateral issues. But even as the counterterrorism relationship deepens, Alsarari said, his government is concerned about AQAP receiving support “from some of the figures in the former regime” as the group extends its reach in Hadramaut.

Saleh remains in Sanaa, and his loyalists control significant ministries in the coalition government. His critics say he is still a political force, meddling in governmental affairs and fomenting instability. The relationship between Saleh and Hadi is growing tense, Alsarari said. But he added that the fight against AQAP will not be affected.

“The government is now committed for real to fight terrorism,” Alsarari said. “Unlike the former regime, the government now does not see that it has to build any form of relationship with al-

Secretary of State John F. Kerry warned North Korea’s young leader Friday that his country would lose any military showdown with the United States, and sought to play down a U.S. intelligence report that North Korea is now capable of delivering a nuclear-armed missile.

The dual signals from Kerry were part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to force North Korea to back away from its increasingly bellicose rhetoric, while also assuaging the concerns of allies and the American public.

Speaking in the South Korean capital, Kerry pledged strong support for that country as well as Japan against threats from Pyongyang, saying that its leader, Kim Jong Un, “needs to understand, as I think he probably does, what the outcome of the conflict would be.”

The tone of that reference to U.S. military power seemed designed to reinforce a message the administration has also delivered more explicitly in recent weeks by repositioning U.S. missile defense equipment and sending nuclear-capable stealth bombers on conspicuous missions over South Korea.

At the same time, Kerry attempted to tamp down the significance of a recent U.S. intelligence report that concluded that North Korea is now capable of making a nuclear warhead that can be mounted on a ballistic missile and fired.

View Graphic How far could North Korean missiles actually go?

If true, it would mean that North Korea has crossed what many regard as the most difficult technical barrier to being able to launch a nuclear attack, even if limited in scope and range.

Kerry said that “it is inaccurate to suggest” that Pyongyang “has fully tested, developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report.”

Kerry was referring to an assessment secretly circulated last month by the Defense Intelligence Agency, a spy service that gathers intelligence and produces analysis for the Pentagon. The finding was made public Thursday when it was mentioned by a Republican congressman during a hearing on Capitol Hill.

North Korea has previously tested stationary nuclear devices, as well as missiles with ranges that could reach parts of the United States. But it has not shown that it has mastered the technical challenge of making a nuclear warhead small and strong enough to be carried by missile to a distant target before detonating.

But Kerry’s use of the phrase “fully tested, developed or demonstrated” seemed to allow for some ambiguity on the question of whether North Korea is capable of making a nuclear warhead, even if it hasn’t exhibited that technology to the outside world.

Statements from the White House and the nation’s intelligence chief included similarly hedged terms.

What may seem like administration obfuscation is “a genuine issue,” said George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “As any of these guys will acknowledge, our intelligence on North Korea is very, very limited. We don’t know what we don’t know.

“A normal country in normal circumstances would not go down the road of relying on such a capability if they haven’t tested it numerous times,” Perkovich said. “When they say they haven’t demonstrated it, that’s true and meaningful . . . but they could have stuff that in desperation they could use. And it could work.”

U.S. officials with access to classified reports said that the DIA tends to go further than other U.S. spy agencies in its assessments of threats, including North Korea’s nuclear program, because of the spy agency’s unique mission.

The DIA is focused on missions that include identifying threats to U.S. forces overseas and making sure that Pentagon leaders are prepared for developments that require a U.S. military response.

Still, officials said that the DIA’s conclusion on North Korea, which it conveyed with “moderate confidence,” is not contradicted by findings from the CIA or other U.S. spy agencies.

“There are some differences [among agencies], but I don’t think they’re huge,” said a Republican member of Congress who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject. “There is a growing body of analytic product” on North Korea and its efforts to develop a warhead that suggest “that if they’re not there, they’re close.”

U.S. officials noted that the latest DIA language is consistent with earlier statements from the agency. In 2011, then-DIA Director Ronald Burgess testified that North Korea “may now have several plutonium-based nuclear warheads that it can deliver by ballistic missiles.”

The urgency of that question has been heightened by the menacing behavior of North Korea’s young and relatively untested leader. Last month, the North Korean news agency released pictures of Kim in a “war room” where a large map was marked with lines meant to depict missile flight paths to major cities in the United States.

U.S. officials have said that and other provocative moves seem aimed at bolstering Kim’s standing in North Korea and abroad.

The existence of the DIA’s latest report surfaced at a congressional hearing this week during questioning by Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), who read an unclassified portion of what others described as a classified but routine update for policymakers on North Korea’s nuclear program.

South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok also sought to play down the significance of the new report in remarks he made during an appearance with Kerry. “Our military’s assessment is that North Korea has not yet miniaturized” a nuclear device, Kim said.

Kerry held crisis talks with officials in Seoul on Friday and heads to Beijing on Saturday to lobby for stronger efforts by China to rein in its reclusive ally. On Sunday, the chief U.S. diplomat is to visit Japan, which, like South Korea, is guaranteed U.S. military protection should North Korea launch an Asian war.

U.S. and Asian diplomats say they doubt North Korea will go that far but acknowledge that a launch of midrange missiles seems increasingly likely, as a show of force meant for U.S. consumption.

USA TODAY

The White House has opposed the strengthening of sanctions

Senators want to up the sanctions to force Iran to compromise

Iran says its offer to limit some nuclear activities has been accepted by world powers in Geneva, who have offered to relax crippling economic sanctions in return.

""Today, they clearly said that they accept the proposed framework by Iran,"" Abbas Araghchi, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, told Iranian state TV, according to the Associated Press.

Araghchi did not provide details of Iran's proposal, and said he expects an agreement on the details Friday. The Iranian announcement came as the chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee said all options were still being reviewed.

Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., said he plans to decide on whether to move forward on a new Iran sanctions bill until after the talks in Geneva are over and he's heard their result.

As Johnson made that statement, word emerged that Secretary of State John Kerry will make an unexpected trip to Geneva on Friday. While there, he will meet with Iran foreign minister Javad Zarif.

The White House has opposed the strengthening of sanctions because it says the move may hurt chances of getting the Iranians to negotiate an end to the standoff. But supporters such as Johnson say that is the opposite of what will happen. They say increased sanctions will make the Iranians realize they must compromise or suffer economically.

U.S. negotiators in Geneva for the talks said they would offer Iran sanctions relief if the Islamic Republic stops expanding its nuclear program as talks continue for several months on a comprehensive solution to its nuclear standoff with world powers.

The Obama administration said before talks resumed Thursday it would ease sanctions on Iran in a way it says would be easily reversible.

In return, Iran would have to agree to limit the level to which it enriches uranium, its stockpiles of nuclear fuel, the capacity of its nuclear facilities and allow foreign inspectors to verify it is keeping its word, according to the White House.

U.S. negotiators, led by Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, will meet again Friday with Iran, together with negotiators from the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday such an interim deal would allow Iran to retain the ability to build nuclear weapons and should be rejected.

""Israel is completely opposed to these proposals,"" Netanyahu said in Jerusalem, according to the Jerusalem Post. ""I believe that adopting them would be a mistake of historic proportions and they should be completely rejected.""

Iran says its nuclear program is aimed at research and producing medical isotopes, and is allowed under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed. The USA and its allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere say Iran is developing a nuclear weapons program.

Both the USA and Israel have said they will use military force if negotiations fail to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

Netanyahu reminded U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who is visiting Israel, the West Bank and Jordan this week, of ""Death to America"" chants in Tehran on Monday, when the 34th anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis was celebrated.

""I believe that that is the real face of the regime. A regime like that cannot be allowed to have the most dangerous weapon in the world,"" Netanyahu said, according to Israel Hayom newspaper.

An interim deal has been on the table for years as a way to keep the talks moving toward an eventual settlement, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security.

""Some of the European partners are afraid that if this doesn't work, the next step is the military option,"" said Albright, a former inspector with the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Europeans ""are more comfortable with this approach of an interim deal first and preserve the possibility to negotiate.""

Any final deal, however, would have to lengthen Iran's ""breakout time,"" Albright said, referring to the time Iran would need to secretly produce enough uranium for a bomb, if it made a decision to do so.

He said Iran would have to agree to several steps that would assure the international community:

• Reduce its uranium centrifuges from 19,000 to 9,000, or fewer if counting more advanced centrifuges that have been installed but not turned on, and disable its heavy water reactor under construction in Arak.

• Reduce Iranian stockpiles of uranium enriched to 20% purity that can easily be converted into weapons-grade uranium that is 90% pure.

• Provide U.N. inspectors access to now-secret plants where centrifuges are produced, and other monitoring that would help international monitors' detect secret centrifuge sites."

President Obama is weighing a military strike against Syria that would be of limited scope and duration, designed to serve as punishment for Syria’s use of chemical weapons and as a deterrent, while keeping the United States out of deeper involvement in that country’s civil war, according to senior administration officials.

The timing of such an attack, which would probably last no more than two days and involve sea-launched cruise missiles — or, possibly, long-range bombers — striking military targets not directly related to Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal, would be dependent on three factors: completion of an intelligence report assessing Syrian government culpability in last week’s alleged chemical attack; ongoing consultation with allies and Congress; and determination of a justification under international law.

“We’re actively looking at the various legal angles that would inform a decision,” said an official who spoke about the presidential deliberations on the condition of anonymity. Missile-armed U.S. warships are already positioned in the Mediterranean.

As the administration moved rapidly toward a decision, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the use of chemical weapons in an attack Wednesday against opposition strongholds on the outskirts of Damascus is now “undeniable.”

Evidence being gathered by United Nations experts in Syria was important, Kerry said, but not necessary to prove what is already “grounded in facts, informed by conscience and guided by common sense.”

The team of U.N. weapons investigators on Monday visited one of three rebel-held suburbs where the alleged attack took place, after first being forced to withdraw when their vehicles came under sniper fire. The Syrian government, which along with Russia has suggested that the rebels were responsible for the chemical attack, agreed to the U.N. inspection over the weekend.

Videos and statements by witnesses and relief organizations such as Doctors Without Borders have proved that an attack occurred, Kerry said. The U.S. intelligence report is to be released this week.

Among the factors, officials said, are that only the government is known to possess chemical weapons and the rockets to deliver them, and its continuing control of chemical stocks has been closely monitored by U.S. intelligence.

Kerry said Syrian forces had engaged in a “cynical attempt to cover up” their actions, not only by delaying the arrival of the U.N. team but by shelling the affected area continually. Any U.S. strike would probably await the departure of the U.N. inspectors from Syria.

Kerry’s statement, which he read to reporters in the State Department briefing room without taking questions, was part of an escalating administration drumbeat, which is likely to include a public statement by Obama in coming days. Officials said the public warnings are designed partly to wring any possible cooperation out of Russia — or an unlikely admission from the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad — before Obama makes his decision.

The administration decided to postpone a meeting with the Russians this week in The Hague to discuss a negotiated solution to the Syrian war, “given our ongoing consultations about the appropriate response to the chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21,” a State Department official said.

At the State Department, Kerry said, “Make no mistake: President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world’s most heinous weapons against the world’s most vulnerable people. Nothing today is more serious, and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny.”

He and other officials drew a sharp distinction between U.S. action related to a violation of international law by what they called Assad’s “massive” use of chemical weapons and any direct military involvement in the Syrian conflict, which is in its third year.

“What we are talking about here is a potential response . . . to this specific violation of international norms,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said. “While it is part of this ongoing Syrian conflict in which we have an interest and in which we have a clearly stated position, it is distinct in that regard.”

Obama and other officials have said repeatedly that no U.S. troops would be sent to Syria. But despite Obama’s year-old threat of an unspecified U.S. response if Assad crossed a “red line” by using chemical weapons, even a limited military engagement seemed unlikely before Wednesday’s attack near Damascus.

“This international norm cannot be violated without consequences,” Kerry said.

The options under consideration are neither new nor open-ended, officials said. The use of “limited stand-off strikes” has long been among the options the Pentagon has provided Obama. “Potential targets include high-value regime air defense, air, ground, missile, and naval forces as well as the supporting military facilities and command nodes,” Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a June letter to Congress. “Stand-off air and missile systems could be used to strike hundreds of targets at a tempo of our choosing.”

Although Dempsey, who has questioned the wisdom of direct military involvement in Syria, said that such an operation would require “hundreds” of ships and aircraft and potentially cost “in the billions,” the action that is being contemplated would be far smaller and designed more to send a message than to cripple Assad’s military and change the balance of forces on the ground. Syrian chemical weapons storage areas, which are numerous and widely dispersed, are seen as unlikely targets.

The language of international criminality has clearly resonated among U.S. allies and lawmakers.

“We will have to act,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who has long opposed any U.S. intervention, including the administration’s decision this summer to send light arms to Syrian opposition forces. “I don’t think we can allow repeated use of chemical weapons now, an escalated use of chemical weapons, to stand.”

Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, emphasized that a U.S. strike should not be directed at altering the dynamic of Syria’s larger civil war.

“I think it should be surgical. It should be proportional. It should be in response to what’s happened with the chemicals,” Corker said in an NBC interview. “But the fact is, I don’t want us to get involved in such a way that we change that dynamic on the ground.” The senator said he thought the administration’s response to the attack was “imminent.”

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said he had been in touch with the White House. In a statement, Boehner echoed concerns expressed by lawmakers from both parties that the administration further consult Congress before taking action.

The administration has said that it will follow international law in shaping its response. Authorization for the use of force against another nation normally comes only from the U.N. Security Council — where Russia and China have vetoed previous resolutions against Assad — or in a NATO operation similar to the one launched in the former Yugoslavia in 1999, without a U.N. mandate.

But much of international law is untested, and administration lawyers are also examining possible legal justifications based on a violation of international prohibitions on chemical weapons use, or on an appeal for assistance from a neighboring nation such as Turkey.

Britain, France and Turkey have said that they would support action if the use of chemical weapons was confirmed, but a clear-cut case is also likely to make approval easier for allies such as Germany, which disagreed with NATO’s 2011 operation in Libya despite the existence of a U.N. resolution.

“The use of chemical weapons would be a crime against civilization,” German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Monday. “The international community must act should the use of such weapons be confirmed.”

Consultations on Syria have been ongoing at the ambassadorial level at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where a meeting is scheduled for Wednesday. The Arab League, which approved the Libya operation, is also due to meet this week to discuss Syria.

Six senators%2C five Republicans and one Democrat%2C announce they oppose Syria resolution

President%27s effort to sway Congress loses steam before his prime-time address Tuesday

Sen. Harry Reid delays test procedural vote that had been planned for Wednesday

WASHINGTON — President Obama's push for congressional approval for military airstrikes in Syria ran aground Monday, forcing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to delay a procedural vote as opposition builds among senators in both parties.

Six senators, including five Republicans and one Democrat, announced Monday they would vote against a resolution authorizing the use of force -- a strong indication that the administration's efforts to build bipartisan support have been ineffective.

The Senate was scheduled to vote Wednesday on a procedural motion to begin formal debate on the resolution, but Reid announced late Monday the vote would be delayed in order to buy the president more time to make his case to senators and the public.

""What we need to do is make sure the president has the opportunity to speak to all 100 senators and all 300 million American people before we do this,"" Reid said.

The delay also came amid reports that Russia was seeking a deal with Syria to dismantle its chemical weapons program. Obama said in television interviews Monday such a deal could circumvent the need for U.S. military intervention, but senators had not been briefed on the development and expressed skepticism.

""I have no idea what's going on. It'd be great if the Russians could convince Assad to turn over his chemical weapons to the international community. That'd be a terrific outcome. I just am very dubious and skeptical,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Comments made Monday in London by Secretary of State John Kerry describing the military effort as ""unbelievably small"" also rankled lawmakers. Graham said Kerry ""undercut everything the president has been doing for the last couple of days"" to build support.

The rapid clip of senators announcing their opposition on Monday raised serious doubts that the president would be able to muster the necessary support in either the House or Senate. The GOP-led House is not likely to take up a resolution unless the Senate can pass it first. A final Senate vote was expected this weekend, but Reid's decision to delay the formal debate puts the schedule in flux.

Five GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Mike Enzi of Wyoming all announced opposition Monday, as did Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.

Briefings by top administration officials and a weekend conversation with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel were not enough to sway Alexander. ""I see too much risk that the strike will do more harm than good by setting off a chain of consequences that could involve American fighting men and women in another long-term Middle East conflict,"" he said.

Heitkamp was the latest in a string of Democratic senators from conservative states to come out in opposition, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark. Heitkamp and Manchin are working on an alternative resolution that would give the Assad government 45 days to sign an international chemical weapons ban and begin turning over its chemical weapons before authorizing U.S. military action.

Two Democratic senators, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, declared their support. However, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., who voted for the resolution in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned Monday that he preferred pursuing diplomatic solutions.

The opposition underscored the uphill battle Obama faces on Capitol Hill to rally around his foreign policy agenda. The president will visit separately with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans on Tuesday before his prime-time television address.

Graham, who supports the resolution, said he believed it could still pass the Senate: ""If the president does a good job tomorrow night, yes."""

Amir Hekmati's letter, handwritten and dated Sept. 1, was addressed to John Kerry and first published Wednesday by Britain's Guardian newspaper.

Hekmati, 30, wrote that he has been ""held on false charges based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions and prolonged periods of solitary confinement.

""This is part of a propaganda and hostage-taking effort by Iranian intelligence to secure the release of Iranians abroad being held on security-related charges,"" he wrote in the letter that the Guardian said was smuggled from the prison.

Family spokesman Greg Romano told The Associated Press that Hekmati's sister, Sarah Hekmati, authenticated the letter, confirming that the handwriting is her brother's as is the letter's tone. Romano provided the AP with a copy of the letter.

The U.S. State Department said it had received the letter.

""We have asked ... Iranian authorities to permit a visit by officials of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran to determine the well-being of Mr. Hekmati and, of course, to release him,"" department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters in Washington on Wednesday.

Switzerland represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran.

Hekmati has been detained in Iran on what the U.S. says are false espionage charges since his 2011 arrest. Hekmati's family says he traveled to Iran to visit his grandmothers.

The letter goes on to say that while Hekmati and his family ""have suffered greatly,"" he ""will accept nothing but"" an unconditional release.

The U.S. previously has requested assistance from new President Hasan Rouhani, who has stressed a more diplomatic approach to foreign affairs than did his hard-line predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The new president is scheduled to visit the United Nations later this month.

Story continues

""It's time for Amir to be released. It's time for him to come home to Michigan, to his family. My brother has committed no crime,"" Sarah Hekmati said in a written statement. ""More than two years in detention, much of which was spent in solitary confinement, is far too long. He has never been a spy for any country or entity or person. They have punished him enough. We hope Iran's new President Rouhani and his new government recognize this point.""

Hekmati was born in Arizona and grew up in Michigan. He carries U.S. and Iranian passports.

Iran accused him of being a CIA spy, then tried, convicted and sentenced him to death. Iran's Supreme Court ordered a retrial last year, but he remains imprisoned.

Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement. Options may include voting by mail, if time permits, curbside voting, and other forms of contactless voting. ""We will do our utmost to make sure every New Brunswicker is provided with the opportunity to vote, while at the same time respecting public health rules and protecting the thousands of people working for us during these elections,"" Poffenroth said.

Biden Jr. delivered a carefully calibrated show of support for Japan on Tuesday, expressing deep concerns about China’s move to control airspace over islands in the East China Sea, but stopping short of a demand that Beijing reverse itself. Instead, he urged the feuding neighbors to talk to each other.

Mr. Biden’s statement, at the start of an unexpectedly challenging trip to Asia that is next taking him to Beijing, captured the complexities for the United States as it navigates a bitter standoff between Japan and China over the territorial claims — a dispute it wishes neither to mediate nor to see escalate.

China’s air defense identification zone, Mr. Biden said after meeting with Japanese leaders, is an effort to “unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea” that raises “the risk of accidents and miscalculation.” He said he would bring up these concerns in detail when he met with the Chinese leadership.

But with China unlikely to rescind a move so laden with nationalistic overtones, the vice president’s focus appeared to be less on rolling back the defense zone than on neutralizing its impact by persuading the Chinese authorities to stop scrambling fighter jets or otherwise disrupting the busy air corridors between Japan and China."

Nine militants%2C most wearing suicide vests%2C attacked Supreme Court complex

The attack sparked running battles with police and army forces



The assault was the most serious in Mogadishu since 2011

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Nine al-Shabab Islamic extremists, most wearing suicide vests, stormed Somalia's main court complex on Sunday while the Supreme Court was in session, firing a barrage of bullets during a running gun battle with security forces that lasted two hours, officials said.

A preliminary death toll stood at 16, including all nine attackers.

The assault was the most serious in Mogadishu since al-Shabab militants were forced out of the capital in August 2011. Al-Shabab controls far less territory today than in years past, and its influence appears to be on the decline, but Sunday's attack proved the extremists are still capable of pulling off well-planned and audacious assaults.

The attack on the Supreme Court complex began at around 12:30 p.m., sparking running battles with police and army forces. Two bomb blasts were heard and gunmen were seen on the roof of a court building firing shots, an Associated Press reporter at the scene said. Police officer Hassan Abdulahi said he saw five dead bodies lying at the entrance to the court.

The militants took an unknown number of hostages during the siege. Many other government workers and civilians in the court complex — a confusing labyrinth of buildings and rooms — hid while fearing for their lives.

Western officials knew militants had been planning something major. The British Foreign Office on Friday released a travel warning for Somalia that warned of a high threat of terrorism. ""We continue to believe that terrorists are in the final stages of planning attacks in Mogadishu,"" it said.

The complex and sustained nature of the assault on the court system suggested militants hoped to inflict severe casualties. Later, a suicide car bomber rammed a vehicle carrying Turkish citizens.

On a Twitter feed believed to belong to the militants, al-Shabab appeared to take credit for the attack. A posting said five militants from the ""Martyrdom Brigade"" took part in the ""daring"" attack.

Interior Minister Abdikarim Hussein Guled said nine militants attacked the court complex, and that six of them detonated suicide vests. Three others were shot and killed during the assault, he said. Guled said he couldn't immediately provide an overall death toll that included government officials and civilians.

Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said the ""pointless and pathetic act"" would have no effect on the government's commitment to progress. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said Somalia is moving forward but the enemy of Somalia and ""of all mankind"" is trying to prevent the country from prospering.

""I want the terrorist to know that our country, Somalia, is moving and will keep moving forward and will not be prevented to achieve the ultimate noble goal, a peaceful and stable Somalia, by a few desperate terrorists,"" Mohamud said.

Ugandan troops stationed in Mogadishu as part of the African Union force arrived at the scene and began taking up sniper positions on rooftops.

The Supreme Court was in session and the court's chief justice may have been the target of the assault, said a Western official who had been speaking to Somali officials. The official spoke on condition he wasn't identified because he wasn't authorized to release the information.

The gunmen took hostages in the complex's main courtroom and forced their way into other rooms in the complex, said another police officer, Abdinasir Nor.

The court complex is a confusing maze of buildings and rooms, allowing for plenty of places to hide but also for many places for gunmen to take hostages. The armed men forced their way inside the complex and immediately set off an explosion, said Yusuf Abdi, who was near the court when the attack happened.

About two hours after the assault began, survivors of the attack began coming out of the court complex. Some were crying and others held their heads in their hands.

""I never expected to make it out alive today,"" said Halima Geddi, who fled the court complex about two hours after the attack. She said she had taken cover behind an outer wall. ""There is no peace. No one protects us. I came to see my boy who was supposed to be tried here.""

At about 3 p.m. a suicide car bomber rammed his vehicle into a car carrying Turkish citizens to the airport, said Mohamed Anjeh, a police commander.

Mogadishu's main government center is heavily guarded with multiple security checks. However, the security at the court complex is not nearly as strong. The Ugandan troops who arrived on scene began pushing back on-lookers shortly after the attack began.

Most militant attacks in Mogadishu are blamed on fighters from al-Shabab, the al-Qaida-linked Islamic extremist rebel group in Somalia. Al-Shabab ruled Mogadishu from roughly 2006 until August 2011, when African Union and Somali forces pushed them out of the city. Since then the al-Shabab extremists have launched suicide bombings on the capital city every few weeks.

Despite those intermittent attacks, Mogadishu is generally considered more peaceful today than most of the previous seven years.

The white-bearded chairman of the council, known as a loya jirga, told Karzai he miscalculated when the Afghan president demanded a delay in signing the agreement until next spring. Chairman Sibghatullah Mojaddedi lectured Karzai, warning that if he delays signing the agreement, “I’ll resign and leave the country.

“If he had listened to my advice, we wouldn’t have this problem today,” Mojaddedi, 89, a former Afghan president and longtime confidant and mentor to Karzai, said as the president sat stiffly a few paces away.

But Karzai remained adamant that he will not sign the accord until after the Afghan presidential election in April. That stubborn stance has infuriated U.S. officials, who Friday imposed a Dec. 31 deadline.

Karzai asked the council for more time to negotiate with the United States. “We’ll try to bargain more with the Americans on your behalf” and then sign the agreement much later, he said.

He asked for a chance to apply more political pressure so Afghanistan doesn’t capitulate on the agreement “for free,” that is, without forcing American concessions.

“If there is no peace, this agreement will bring misfortune to Afghanistan,” Karzai added in a somewhat elliptical reference to the potential impact of the accord.

Karzai did not indicate whether he ultimately will brush aside the loya jirga recommendation and defy the U.S. deadline. The Afghan president is notorious for delaying tactics that seek to extract concessions and keep himself at the center of events, especially as he enters a lame-duck period before his term ends in April.

The loya jirga’s bold defiance of Karzai presents an opportunity for the mercurial president to save face and back down on the brinkmanship that has put the security deal in serious jeopardy. Mojaddedi told Karzai bluntly: “If there is a problem in the future” with the agreement, “the jirga is responsible.”

Karzai convened the loya jirga, an informal but influential traditional assembly, to give himself political cover and deflect responsibility for signing a long-term commitment with the United States, according to many Afghan analysts. Karzai faces significant opposition from Afghan traditionalists who condemn any cooperation with foreigners, especially the United States.

Karzai remained defiant Sunday, telling the jirga’s 2,700 delegates that American soldiers continue to raid Afghan homes and kill civilians. He dug in his heels over that issue last week, just hours after agreeing with U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry on the text of the draft 24-page security pact.

President Obama responded with a personal letter to Karzai on Thursday that pledged U.S. troops would enter Afghan homes only in “extraordinary” circumstances and only if American lives were at direct risk.

Mojaddedi confronted Karzai after the president joined him on the stage, firmly reminding him that the U.S. had given written assurances on so-called U.S. night raids. The loya jirga voted to attach Obama’s letter to the text of the proposed Bilateral Security Agreement.

“I repeat: The United States cannot enter Afghan homes and kill people,” Karzai told the chairman, who turned to face him on the assembly stage. Mojaddedi, gesticulating forcefully, again told the man he called his “son and student” to accept U.S. assurances and sign now, not later.

Karzai muttered, “All right,” and abruptly left the stage.

In voting to approve the agreement, the loya jirga said in its formal declaration that Karzai should sign by the end of the year. The council recommended several additions to the pact, among them the release of 19 Afghans from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay and a stronger U.S. pledge to defend Afghanistan from any incursion from its neighbors, particularly Pakistan.

The loya jirga also voted to request that the U.S. military add a base to the nine bases that would be occupied by U.S. troops under the proposed security pact after combat forces depart Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

The base is in Bamian province in central Afghanistan, where the NATO-led military coalition has maintained a presence. Bamian is a population center for Hazaras, a Shiite Muslim minority whose members were massacred by the Taliban prior to the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the militant group. Afghan analysts said Hazara delegates proposed the additional base.

The agreement must still be approved by Afghanistan’s elected parliament. Karzai will decide when to present it to the legislature, which is expected to endorse it.

Approval by the loya jirga capped a fraught six-day showdown between Karzai and the United States that began with a phone call negotiation between Karzai and Kerry on Tuesday. It peaked with Washington threatening to leave no troops after 2014 — meaning a drastic cut in billions of dollars in military and development aid sent to Afghanistan.

That threat panicked many ordinary Afghans, as well as wealthy Afghan businessmen. Those concerns were reflected in the loya jirga membership. Most of the 50 loya jirga committee chairpersons who spoke Sunday urged Karzai to sign the pact quickly to avoid a collapse in security at a time when the Taliban insurgency remains potent.

If approved, the agreement would allow the U.S. to deploy military advisors to train and equip Afghan security forces, along with U.S. special-operations troops for counter-terrorism missions against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Obama will determine the size of the force.

Karzai “overreached” and miscalculated the true sentiments of the loya jirga and the Afghan people, Waliullah Rahmani, director of the Kabul Center for Strategic Studies, said in an interview. He said most Afghans recognize that the country cannot survive without U.S. military and cash assistance, along with the international commitment the post-2014 U.S. presence would bring.

“I don’t think President Karzai expected this,” Rahmani said. “He won’t be able to resist the national will of the Afghan people, as expressed today through the loya jirga.”

Iran reportedly upgrading its uranium-enrichment program



Uranium can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear warheads

Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only

LONDON – Iran is attempting to speed up its uranium-enrichment program by upgrading technology at a key nuclear facility, diplomats with knowledge of the matter have told the Associated Press.

The diplomats were not named because they are not authorized to speak about the matter.

The diplomats said Iran has told the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency that it wants to install thousands of high-technology machines at its main enriching site at Natanz, in central Iran.

The machines can enrich two or three times faster than the present equipment being used by Tehran.

Uranium can be used to make fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear warheads.

Separately, Reuters reported Thursday that it had seen a document sent by Iran to the IAEA which said that ""centrifuge machines type IR2m will be used in Unit A-22"" at Iran's facility in Natanz. Reuters said the details of the letter were divulged by a diplomat who declined to be identified.

On Thursday, Greg Webb, a press representative for the IAEA in Vienna, declined to comment on what the unnamed diplomats told the AP or on the document made available to Reuters.

Iran has maintained that it is refining uranium to meet its nuclear-energy needs, and that its nuclear program is being developed entirely for peaceful purposes. Many in the international community have raised doubts about that pledge."

A bipartisan group of foreign policy leaders in the Senate warned in unusually blunt terms Tuesday that Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki may be pulling his country back toward civil war.

In a letter to President Obama timed for Maliki’s visit to Washington, the leaders of the Senate defense and foreign affairs committees said Maliki is contributing to what the lawmakers called an alarming slide toward sectarian violence compounded by the Syrian civil war next door.

Obama will see Maliki at the White House on Friday.

“Prime Minister Maliki’s mismanagement of Iraqi politics is contributing to the recent surge of violence,” Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote.

Maliki’s Shiite-led government is too dominated by Iran’s “malign influence” and its mistreatment of the Sunnis is pushing that minority group toward extremism, the senators charged.

“These were the same conditions that drove Iraq toward civil war during the last decade and we fear that fate could befall Iraq once again,” the letter said.

The Obama administration has tried without much success to foster a more inclusive government in Baghdad. That impasse is expected to be one major topic for Maliki’s meeting with the president. His request for more U.S. counterterrorism aid is the other.

Iraq wants to buy U.S.-made Apache helicopters, among other equipment.

The request is now before Congress, and the bipartisan Senate group appeared to endorse it.

Among the senators’ recommendations for Obama is greater counterterrorism aid for Iraq, to deal with the resurgence and expansion of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Iraq.

Iraq’s ambassador to the United States, Lukman Faily, said the security concerns would top Iraq’s agenda for meetings this week across the administration and in Congress.

He acknowledged U.S. concern about Iraq’s political balance, and the case Obama is likely to make to Maliki about the cost of excluding Sunnis.

“We have done our homework,” he said."

Tests found signatures of sarin gas in blood and hair samples collected from the Damascus site of an alleged chemical weapons attack, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union.

The samples were collected separately from a United Nations investigation into the August 21 attack and provide further proof that the Syrian regime attacked its own people, Kerry said.

With ""each day that goes by, this case is even stronger,"" he said, arguing that the United States must act.

""If you don't do it, you send a message of impunity,"" Kerry said. Iran, North Korea, and Hezbollah ""will look at the United States and say 'Nothing means anything' -- that's what's at stake here,"" he said.

Syria denies using chemical weapons on its people and blames the rebels.

Kerry called the evidence ""overwhelming"" Sunday, and the Arab League issued a statement blaming the Syrian government for the attack.

But the United Nations argued that world leaders should wait until U.N. investigators determine whether chemical weapons were used.

""The U.N. mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons,"" Martin Nesirky, spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said repeatedly at a news conference.

So when will the results be ready? The U.N. won't give a timeline, Nesirky said. ""It's being done as fast as it is possible to do within the scientific constraints.""

Samples will be delivered to laboratories Monday, he said.

The investigation involves a strict chain of custody and clear guidelines, he said, adding that two Syrian government officials monitored the process.

But even when it's done, the U.N. will only say whether chemical weapons were used -- not who was responsible.

Obama's last-minute Syria switch

U.S. military action appeared imminent until Saturday, when Obama announced he would first seek lawmakers' approval.

""While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,"" Obama said Saturday. The 1973 War Powers Act technically allows him to strike without such approval.

Lawmakers officially come back from recess on September 9.

But some members of Congress arrived on Capitol Hill Sunday for a classified briefing on Syria with White House, State Department and Pentagon officials.

""There was a great deal of skepticism in the room about the utility, effectiveness and support that we would have for the kind of strike that the president has proposed,"" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut. ""There's not a lot of skepticism, frankly, about whether or not this was an attack carried out by the Syrian regime. While nobody would say that it's been proven, the vast bulk of the evidence suggests that this was an attack carried out by the Assad regime.""

Sen. John McCain told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that Obama had invited him to a Monday meeting at the White House to discuss the next steps in Syria. McCain, who has been pushing for military intervention in Syria, said he had questions for the president.

""I want to find out whether there is a plan and a strategy. I want to find out whether this is just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America,"" McCain told CNN. ""But I will say that if Congress overrules a decision of the president of the United States on an issue of national security, that could set a catastrophic precedent in the future. It would be a very dangerous precedent to be setting.""

Global debate surges over Syria

At a meeting in Cairo Sunday, Arab League foreign ministers condemned the chemical weapons attack, urging the international community to take action and calling for the prosecution of those responsible.

""The Syrian regime bears full responsibility for the use of chemical weapons (in) this heinous crime,"" foreign ministers from the regional organization said in a statement, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.

""The council also called for providing the required forms of support for the Syrian people to defend themselves and the need for concerted Arab and international efforts to help them,"" the statement said.

Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby said in a Twitter post that the league was calling for the United Nations Security Council to ""assume its responsibility and take all the deterrent and needed measures against this crime and all crimes of genocide"" in Syria.

But the statements Sunday did not directly refer to the United States, and it's unclear how much international support the U.S. government would have if it chooses to strike Syria.

At the Arab League meeting, Saudi Arabia called for international action, but Egypt said it was opposed to foreign intervention in the Syrian crisis.

Britain has voted against taking any military action in Syria, and France said it won't act without the United States as a partner.

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle tweeted Sunday that the time gained waiting for U.S. congressional approval ""must be used to reach a common position of the international community within the U.N. Security Council.""

The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are warning of a higher risk of cyberattacks after months of disruptions by hackers known as the Syrian Electronic Army , and authorities say more attacks are likely.

Opposition: Obama gave false hope

The shift to ask for approval from Congress left some analysts scratching their heads.

""The decision-making has been so confused and muddled that it's difficult to put the word 'wise' in front of anything they're doing right now,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said on Sunday. ""The administration has hesitated between nonintervention and intervention, and it is caught between those two.""

The Obama administration, Zakaria said, ""seems to want to have it both ways, but it can't.""

Others praised the president for taking a step to get more buy-in at home and abroad.

""Frankly, I think he looks prudent, and I don't doubt his resolve on this,"" John Negroponte, who served as director of national intelligence for two years under President George W. Bush, told CNN's State of the Union. ""I don't think he's looking for an excuse to get out from a box or a situation that he painted himself into.""

While some praised the president for giving Congress a chance to weigh in, a key group of Syrian dissidents said it was surprised and concerned by Obama's new approach.

""We can't understand how you can promise to help those who are being slaughtered every day in the hundreds, giving them false hope, then change your mind and say let's wait and see,"" the Syrian National Coalition said.

Iran, a staunch supporter of the Syrian regime, warned the United States will pay a price if it strikes Syria.

Syria reacts

The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against the regime.

Maria Saadeh, a member of Syria's parliament, told CNN on Sunday that she sees no justification for a U.S. strike on Syria.

""There is no legitimacy to make this attack,"" she said, accusing rebel groups of using chemical weapons and committing other crimes against humanity.

Syrian state media have been packed with critiques of the U.S. position since Obama's announcement Saturday. An editorial in the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper Sunday said that Obama had declared ""the beginning of a historic American retreat.""

Meanwhile, the opposition Syrian National Coalition issued a statement aimed at U.S. lawmakers.

""The Syrian National Coalition calls on the American congress to carry their historical responsibility towards the Syrian people and take the right decision to support the American government approach to stop the killing machine of the Syrian criminal regime,"" the statement said.

Sarin allegedly used previously in Syrian civil war

World leaders have said previously that sarin has been used in the Syrian civil war.

In April, the United States said it had evidence sarin was used in Syria on a small scale.

In May, a U.N. official said there were strong suspicion s that rebel forces used the deadly nerve agent."

Some 56 percent of those surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syria, while only 19 percent supported action, the online poll found. Some 25 percent said they did not know what course of action the United States should take. The findings are essentially unchanged from last week and indicated that Obama changed few minds on Saturday when he argued that Washington has the obligation to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for what the United States says was a sarin gas attack that killed more than 1,400 people, including hundreds of children, near Damascus on August 21. The poll showed that respondents were more likely to support a strike if they were specifically asked about the chemical-weapons attack. Even then, only 29 percent said the United States should intervene, while 48 percent opposed action. Another 24 percent said they did not know. Obama said on Saturday he had decided the United States should take military action against Syrian government targets but has asked Congress to approve the action in an acknowledgement that many Americans have little appetite for new military engagements after more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. The U.S. public's reluctance to get involved in Syria closely mirrors public sentiment in the United Kingdom, where Parliament last week voted down a motion to support military action by the United States' closest ally. In the United States, 65 percent of those surveyed in a separate tracking poll agreed with a statement that said ""the problems of Syria are none of our business."" In the United Kingdom, a parallel poll by Ipsos found that 58 percent agreed with that statement. Similarly, only 29 percent support the Obama administration's decision to arm anti-government rebels in Syria, while 49 percent oppose that move. Another 21 percent said they didn't know whether they agreed or disagreed with that strategy. The online poll of 1,195 adult Americans was conducted between August 30 and September 3. It has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. (Reporting by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Karey Van Hall and Philip Barbara)"

The article opens by describing Afghanistan as “the graveyard of empires” which is “bearing witness to the fall of another self-proclaimed ‘Super Power,’ i.e. the U.S.A.”

The Middle East Media Research Institute has provided excerpts of the article in which various examples of Muslim military victories throughout the centuries are highlighted. The article then turns toward contemporary wars, making the point that just as the Soviets left Afghanistan in defeat so too:

The world is seeing as a handful of mujahideen under the leadership of Mullah Omar are defeating one of the most powerful super powers in the history of the world. …When the U.S. attacked Afghanistan [in October 2001], the people of intellect were wondering how long it would take for America to suffer its inevitable defeat and who would be leading its army when it would eventually drag its defeated tail out of Afghanistan.

The excerpts also show a juxtaposition between the rise of poverty and want in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev in the 1980s and the rise of traditional poverty indicators under Obama during this time in office. Whereas Gorbachev had to introduce a “war-food system of food distribution for his citizens,” America has witnessed a poverty increase from 37.3 million in 2007 to 46.9 million in 2010, according to Azan.

Moreover, the article touches on the “severe public discontent” under Gorbachev and the movements calling for “separation” which erupted in parts of the Soviet Union at that time. In the same way, the article claims there are “various movements” likewise calling for separation in the U.S. now. According to Azan, “around 30 states [are] calling for separation.”

Although the figure of “30 states” is wrong, the overarching goal of the article may still prove successful–that goal is to show that Obama, like Gorbachev before him, is a weak man who’s losing his grip on this own country while simultaneously facing defeat abroad.

The tagline is simple–Obama is weak like Gorbachev, the U.S. is being defeated like the U.S.S.R."

AFP PHOTO/GAMAL NOMAN (Photo credit should read GAMAL NOMAN/AFP/Getty Images)

By Susan Cornwell

WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - When the Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda placed a bounty on her husband's head, Mary Feierstein learned of it from a friend who called and said, ""You must be a mess!""

U.S. Ambassador Gerald Feierstein was thousands of miles (km) away at the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, without his wife and family on what is called an ""unaccompanied"" posting.

He is one of more than a thousand U.S. diplomats on such tours of duty in danger spots around the world, part of a trend that is changing the definition of being a diplomat.

Over time, his wife has learned to stay calm when the phone rings unexpectedly at her home outside Washington. For nearly five years, she has not lived in the same country as her husband, a career diplomat who specializes in the Middle East and South Asia.

After militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Yemen last September, breaking through to the inner building and ripping plaques and lettering from the walls, Feierstein called his wife to tell her he was OK.

He had also called her a few years earlier when he was based in Islamabad, Pakistan, and a bomb went off near his residence. He was unhurt in that attack.

But when Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - considered by U.S. officials to be al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate - offered 3 kg of gold last December for the killing of Feierstein, it was Mary's turn to call her husband. He played down the danger.

""He said it was old news. They are constantly under threat, you know,"" Mary Feierstein said in her first media interview since the threat.

After a police officer came to her home to give her his card and tell her to call him if she needed any help, ""that's when I got scared,"" Feierstein said.

The new perils for foreign service officers were spotlighted last Sept. 11, when militants overran the temporary U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, killing four Americans, including Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Two other U.S. diplomats were killed in Afghanistan in the past year.

President Barack Obama, still grappling with controversy over the Benghazi attack, called on Congress on Friday to fully fund his $4 billion embassy security budget request.

In a memorial ceremony earlier this month at the State Department, Vice President Joe Biden said that diplomats ""take risks that sometimes exceed those of the women and men in uniform.""

Honored along with Stevens were Sean Patrick Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who died in Benghazi; and foreign service officers Anne Smedinghoff and Ragaei Said Abdelfattah, killed in Afghanistan in 2013 and 2012.

FIVE-FOLD INCREASE IN UNACCOMPANIED DIPLOMATS

The State Department says there are about 1,100 U.S. foreign service officers now at posts abroad where they are unaccompanied or there are limits on who can accompany them - usually meaning no children.

That is a five-fold increase in unaccompanied American diplomats over the past decade, and represents about 14 percent of U.S. foreign service officers serving overseas.

The change began with ""civilian surges"" into the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan to help with stabilization and reconstruction. Over 400 unaccompanied diplomats are in those countries.

Then, the Arab Spring uprisings starting in 2011 added many unstable countries to the list where the State Department did not want to send families.

The fluctuating list now includes Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya and Tunisia, as well as the new African state of South Sudan, the State Department said.

The U.S. embassies in Algeria, Sudan and Lebanon are in the ""limited accompanied"" category as is the U.S. Consulate in Mexico's third-largest city, Monterrey, a focal point for drug-related violence.

The risks to diplomats are not all external. A 2007 State Department survey said 17 percent of employees who had served in dangerous posts indicated some symptoms similar to those of post-traumatic stress disorder. The department, following the military's lead, has set up a program to help diagnose and treat PTSD in its employees.

Mary Feierstein realized she was one of an expanding group of left-behind relatives when she started attending the year-end holiday parties the State Department throws for them, and noticed the crowd getting bigger every year.

She also noticed a lot of small children at those parties, and admitted to thinking, ""At least my kids are grown."" Her children, two daughters and a son, are all in their 20s. Her son has served two tours of duty with the Marines in Iraq.

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the holiday parties, at which some of the unaccompanied diplomats were Skyped in from abroad. Feierstein said she thought Obama should attend too.

The president did call Gerald Feierstein to thank him for his service after the Yemen embassy was attacked last Sept. 13, two days after the Benghazi assaults.

'NEW NORM'

The United States used to be quicker to evacuate its embassies and consulates when dangers arose, said Susan Johnson, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the official union representing the Foreign Service.

These days, Washington tries to manage risks by building up the physical security of posts and increasing diplomatic security personnel, she said.

""In the process, we seem to have built a new level of tolerance for the amount of risk our diplomats face,"" Johnson said, adding that unaccompanied tours were increasingly becoming ""a new norm.""

There is pressure on diplomats to do the dangerous tours in order to advance. It is perceived to be ""almost mandatory"" to serve at an unaccompanied post and ""punch that ticket"" during a Foreign Service career, she said.

The State Department said 20 percent of its current employees had served in Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan.

The department offers incentives such as danger pay and shorter tours. Unaccompanied posts can be just 12 months, with several breaks, and families can often be left behind at a previous post to minimize disruption.

The State Department has made considerable progress in supporting employees in unaccompanied posts, its inspector general said in a 2010 report. Still, it said, ""many returnees experience problems adjusting to their follow-on assignments,"" and more counseling services may be needed.

Mary Feierstein was born in Pakistan and met her husband on his first tour there in the 1970s. She said he was one of some ""really tough people"" that the State Department keeps cycling through stressful, dangerous posts.

Gerald Feierstein served in Lebanon unaccompanied in 2003 and 2004, then returned to Washington for a few years and was a senior official in the State Department's counterterrorism office.

He was sent to Pakistan for the third time in his career in 2008, as deputy chief of mission in Islamabad. His family stayed in the United States. In September 2010, Feierstein went to Yemen, again without his family.

""We were planning to go later. ... After the Arab Spring, we haven't been able to go there at all,"" Mary Feierstein said.

At home, she volunteers for the local Democratic Party and supports causes like gun control. She last saw her husband in March.

While tired of the separation, she said she felt sorrier for her children, even though they are grown. ""They miss him so much. They are so happy when he comes home."" (Editing by Warren Strobel and Peter Cooney)"

USA TODAY

He stops short of demanding congressional authorization before military action

Other lawmakers say Congress must authorize action

WASHINGTON — House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, sent a letter to President Obama seeking answers to 14 questions regarding U.S. military intervention in Syria, but the speaker stopped short of seeking a formal authorization vote before the president can engage.

Rather, Boehner contended that the president needs to consult with Congress but make the case to the American people to justify engaging in Syria's civil war. Noting that Obama's self-described ""red line"" against Syria's use of chemical weapons has been crossed, Boehner wrote that Obama should ""provide a clear, unambiguous explanation of how military action – which is a means, not a policy – will secure U.S. objectives and how it fits into your overall policy.""

Among the questions Boehner asked: How the administration determined that the scope of chemical weapons use warrants military action; what the purpose of a strike would be; what it would intend to achieve; if further strikes will be conducted if initial efforts don't change the reality on the ground; and whether the administration may seek more money from Congress to conduct such operations.

Boehner said the administration's outreach has been insufficient to mollify lawmakers' concerns. ""I have conferred with the chairmen of the national security committees who have received initial outreach from senior administration officials, and while the outreach has been appreciated, it is apparent from the questions above that the outreach has, to date, not reached the level of substantive consultation,"" he wrote.

Boehner's letter comes the same day as at least 111 House lawmakers signed a letter by Rep. Scott Rigell, R-Va., calling on Obama to seek a vote of congressional approval before any military action can be taken. The lawmakers contend that to act without their authority violates the Constitution, but the administration contends it is not legally required to seek authorization to act in the immediate national security interest.

Whether the Syria situation meets that standard is a matter of debate in Washington, but Boehner's letter indicated support for the administration's view that it has the constitutional authority for limited military engagement in Syria.

""I am mindful that Syria is one of the few places where the immediate national security interests of the United States so visibly converge with broader U.S. security interests and objectives,"" he wrote."

Miller: A strike would have to be broader than Obama describing, and Americans fear this

President Barack Obama's speech to the American public Monday night was eloquent and forceful. But given the odds arrayed against him -- some of his own making -- the persuader in chief likely won't make the sale.

Indeed, it's likely that none of the other great communicators and explainers -- Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton -- could have either. And here's why:

Chico Marx was right

Impersonating Groucho in ""Duck Soup,"" Chico makes a remark that sums up Obama's challenge: ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?""

The American people are their own experts this time around on what constitutes a vital national interest for the United States and what they want done about it.

After two of the longest and most profitless wars in American history, the public has a more discriminating assessment of what's worth fighting for and what's not. And, deeply dismayed by the standard for victory -- when can we leave, not how do we win -- most Americans rightly see a U.S. military strike on Syria as an imperfect option that is likely either to be ineffective or to draw the U.S. into another country's civil war.

Aaron David Miller

One speech could never overcome the skepticism and doubts left by a decade of two pointless wars. And this one didn't.

It's not that Americans are unmoved by the president's heartfelt descriptions of dead Syrian children gassed by, the administration says, President Bashar al-Assad's murderous forces; it's that their priorities lie elsewhere.

But it's America's broken house that's in need of repair, not someone else's. And no amount of false analogies to Munich and appeasement will sway them. They know what they see, and it's not compelling enough to justify the uncertainties of a military strike.

The president's words last night didn't allay those doubts.

Obama's Syria policy is a Marx Brothers movie

Over the past week, one got the feeling that every day another door opened on the Syria issue with yet another surprise. The twists and turns didn't help the administration's case for clarity and consistency, which is so critical to providing the background of a speech to the nation. Indeed, events of the past week made the president's task much harder.

JUST WATCHED Syria debate: week in review, week 1 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Syria debate: week in review, week 1 02:25

First, after a buildup to one of the most widely telegraphed military actions in the history of warfare, the president surprised the nation by deferring military action while he sought an authorization to use force from Congress. That was followed by an off-the-cuff remark by Secretary of State John Kerry on how al-Assad could preempt a military attack by turning over all his chemicals weapons.

The next surprise was a Russian endorsement of Kerry's idea -- and then Syria jumping aboard the peace train. The result: On the eve of the president's speech -- presumably aimed at making the case for a military strike -- the momentum had shifted away from war as the United Nations, the French and the secretary-general all try to figure out how to make peace and take al-Assad's chemicals off line.

The American public -- already confused as to whether the strike would be ""unbelievably small"" (in John Kerry's words) or, in the president's words, more robust (""the U.S. military doesn't do pinpricks"") -- could be forgiven if it was a tad bewildered.

Overselling the risks of not acting

Much of the president's speech dealt with the consequences of not acting militarily in the face of the largest single deployment of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988. There's no doubt that doing nothing would broaden al-Assad's margin to use these weapons again if he felt it necessary.

But we need to be clear: This regime is engaged in a fight to preserve itself and will do whatever is necessary to stay in power. A U.S. strike would have to be extremely punishing to deter al-Assad from using these weapons and extremely comprehensive in its scope to degrade al-Assad's capacity. The president can't make his case by playing down the severity of any U.S. response.

The other risks of inaction -- deterring Iran from nuclear weapons or suggesting that the U.S. is threatened by these weapons -- just don't add up and aren't compelling.

Indeed, should al-Assad be weakened or lose control, these chemical weapons might well fall into the hands of al Qaeda and other jihadist groups that could use them directly against the United States.

Our cardboard conception of leadership

Even under normal circumstances, a single presidential speech to persuade Americans to back a military strike would be a tough sell. Presidential speeches rarely move the needle much on an issue like this. We have this artificial conception of our president's capacity.

If only the president could make the case with powerful logic, he can indeed persuade. The only thing that's missing is leadership.

But that's really not the way it works. Presidents are more often prisoners of events. The great ones -- Abraham Lincoln, FDR -- are fortunate (if that's the right word) to have circumstances that allow them to do so. And they intuit and extract opportunities from those circumstances that allow them to lead.

Obama doesn't have these circumstances.

He faces a public that is deeply skeptical of attacking another Arab/Muslim country; a divided and skeptical Congress; and an international community that fears military action. And he confronts this environment with a military option that he himself doesn't really believe in either. There's no real sense of urgency or emergency, partly because the president has willfully downplayed that sense of crisis.

Obama is an ambivalent warrior. He fashions himself the extricator in chief charged with getting America out of profitless conflicts, not getting them into new ones. And it shows.

Monday night's speech reflected a man who on one hand would like to be rescued by a diplomatic solution to a problem he himself knows can't be resolved by military force and on the other, one who realizes he has a very bad military option if he must go forward.

And as a consequence, what was hyped as a major speech really couldn't be, in large part because there was nothing to decide and no urgency to do so.

Congress isn't going to vote this week; the U.S. isn't going to war soon; and Vladimir Putin's diplomacy from Russia has yet to play itself out. Indeed, right now the president can't be the decider in chief because there's nothing to decide.

For now, Obama -- along with the rest of the country -- is stuck in limbo between a war he clearly doesn't want and diplomatic approach he knows faces long odds. And no presidential speech could free him or the country from that predicament."

(CNN) —

Weeks after getting asylum in Russia, Edward Snowden now has a job there, one of his lawyers says.

Snowden, the U.S. national security contractor turned leaker, will start a job Friday with a major Russian website, his attorney Anatoly Kucherena told CNN Thursday.

Kucherena declined to name the employer for security reasons. He told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that Snowden would perform maintenance for the site.

Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims

Snowden, a 30-year-old former government information technology contractor, collected information on spy programs – in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States – and exposed the programs to the media.

Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Hong Kong in late May and flew on June 23 to Moscow, where he holed up at the airport for more than five weeks.

U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property.

After Russia granted him an asylum term of one year on August 1, he left the airport.

As Snowden got ready to start his new job, he was also meeting Thursday with a German lawmaker who visited him in Russia.

Hans-Christian Stroebele, a well-known leftist legislator in Germany, met with Snowden in Moscow to invite him to testify before the German parliament.

According to Stroebele’s website, during their meeting, Snowden gave him a letter addressed to the German parliament and to the country’s attorney general.

Stroebele, a member of the Green party, tweeted a picture of himself with Snowden and said he would hold a news conference Friday to provide details about the letter’s contents.

The meeting comes amid outrage among many German leaders over claims that an NSA surveillance operation targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.

Germany’s Der Spiegel news magazine first reported the alleged operation, citing documents leaked by Snowden.

Stroebele sits on a parliamentary committee that monitors intelligence agencies.

http://news.yahoo.com/hagel-warns-china-cyberattacks-072516292.html,,[],Hagel warns China on cyberattacks,"SINGAPORE (AP) — Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel delivered a two-pronged message to Beijing — holding out hope for a slowly improving military relationship with the Asian giant while issuing a stern warning on cyberattacks coming from that country. But he was met with immediate skepticism from the Chinese delegation in the audience, who questioned America's role in the Pacific.

Speaking Saturday at a security conference in Singapore that he helped to form more than a decade ago, Hagel said: ""The United States has expressed our concerns about the growing threat of cyber intrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military."" While he is not the first U.S. official to publicly blame China for computer-based attacks that steal data from U.S. government and corporate networks, he delivered the rebuke in China's backyard, with members of Beijing's government in the audience.

His comments triggered a wry response from Maj. Gen. Yao Yunzhu, director of the Center for China-America Defense Relations, at the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Military Science, who challenged him to better explain America's intentions in its building up of the military across the region.

""Thank you for mentioning China several times,"" she told Hagel, minutes after he concluded his remarks, and began taking questions from the audience. As an audible murmur and some quiet chuckles rose from the crowd, she added that America's new shift to the Pacific has been widely interpreted as an ""attempt to counter China's rising influence, and to offset the increasing military capabilities of the Chinese PLA. However, China is not convinced.""

She asked Hagel how he can assure China that the increased military deployments to the region are part of an effort to build a more positive relationship with Beijing.

""That's really the whole point behind closer military-to-military relationships,"" Hagel responded. ""We don't want miscalculations and misunderstandings and misinterpretations. And the only way you do that is you talk to each other.""

Story continues

He said the U.S. welcomes a strong and emerging China that takes on responsibilities for security in the region, and that Beijing and Washington have to be inclusive and direct with each other. ""I think we've made continued progress,"" he said. ""And we'll make more progress.""

Defense officials said Hagel also broadly raised the issue of cybersecurity in a brief, informal meeting with Lt. Gen. Qi Jianguo, PLA deputy chief, on Friday evening. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to publicly discuss the content of the meeting, said it was one of several subjects that were touched on in the session and that Hagel mentioned plans for the formation of a cyber working group.

In his speech, Hagel said the U.S. is determined to work closely with China and other nations to establish appropriate standards for behavior in cyberspace. And the U.S. will also be looking to China for help in resolving ongoing problems with North Korea, which in recent months has ratcheted up tensions in the region with a series of rocket launches, an underground nuclear test and threats of nuclear strikes against the U.S. and its allies.

Noting America's longstanding tensions with China, Hagel said: ""The key is for these differences to be addressed on the basis of a continuous and respectful dialogue."" The two nations, he said, must build trust in order to avoid military miscalculations.

Much of the speech, however, was designed as a follow-up to last year's gathering, when then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta first detailed what has been called the military's new pivot to the Pacific. Hagel assured Asian nations that despite sharp budget cuts, the Pentagon will continue to shift its military troops, ships and aircraft to the Pacific region.

Where Panetta had laid out promises, Hagel was able to point to results. Marines have been deployed to the northern city of Darwin in Australia, a combat ship has arrived in Singapore and plans are unfolding for Army units that will rotate in and out of the region.

Hagel also suggested that the Pentagon's five-year budget plan continues to plan for additional F-22 Raptor fighter jets and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in the region, along with a fourth fast-attack submarine deployed to Guam.

He provided a glimpse into the broad review he ordered to determine whether budget cuts will force the U.S. military strategy to change — a year after Panetta unveiled it.

International leaders have been watching the deliberations in Washington closely to see what the roughly $487 billion in automatic spending cuts over the next 10 years will mean to America's commitment's abroad. Already the military services have curtailed flight and combat training for many units, grounded some Air Force squadrons and delayed or canceled some ship deployments.

The Pentagon has also announced it will furlough about 680,000 civilian employees for up to 11 days through the end of the fiscal year.

The initial report on the strategy review was due to Hagel on Friday, and while he said the outcome is not final, it should reflect the rise of Asia.

""For the region, this means I can assure you that coming out of this review, the United States will continue to implement the rebalance and prioritize our posture, activities and investments in Asia-Pacific,"" he said.

The Asia-Pacific, said Hagel, is at the epicenter of historic changes around the world and the U.S. is committed to strengthening its military, economic and diplomatic partnerships with nations across the region. As part of that he noted that the U.S. will set aside $100 million to expand its military exercises in the region.

Just finishing his third month as Pentagon Chief, Hagel used the speech to introduce himself on a more personal level to the audience. For many he is a familiar face, since he was one of the founders of the conference in 2002, and as a U.S. senator, was a speaker at the first three gatherings.

He talked about his long ties to the region, including his father's service in World War II flying B-25 bombers in the South Pacific, and his own service in Vietnam with his brother. Hagel was wounded and twice received the Purple Heart.

Later, he traveled to Asia as the co-founder of a cellular telephone company and then, as a GOP senator from Nebraska, he served on the Foreign Relations Committee.

""What I took away from all these experiences,"" Hagel said, ""was a firm belief that the arc of the 21st century would be shaped by events here in Asia."""

Obama has said chemical weapons would be a %27red line%27 for U.S. action

President Obama said Friday that Syria's potential use of chemical weapons would be a ""game changer,"" but the U.S. and its global partners must thoroughly investigate suspicions raised by intelligence agencies.

That probe will seek ""more direct evidence and confirmation"" of chemical weapons use and could take a long time, Obama said before meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan.

""This is not an on or off switch,"" Obama said. ""This is going to be a long-tern proposition.""

Obama spoke as White House aides continued to strike a cautious note on claims that Syria has used chemical weapons against rebels, saying President Obama wants all the facts before deciding how to proceed.

Intelligence agencies believe ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that Bashar Assad's government has used small amounts of sarin gas in clashes with Syria rebels, officials said.

Said Obama: ""These are preliminary assessments; they're based on our intelligence gathering. We have varying degrees of confidence about the actual use, but there are a range of questions around how, when, where these weapons may have been used.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to put a timeline on the investigation. ""The facts need to be what drives this investigation, not a deadline,"" he said.

Carney said the administration is now backing a United Nations investigation into the issue to make ""a definitive judgment"" in the use of chemical weapons.

Also from Carney: ""This is not an airtight case. We do have some evidence, but we need to build on that.""

In August, President Obama said any Syrian use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line"" that would prompt a U.S. response. Obama has not specified what that response might be, and neither did Carney on Friday.

""All options remain on the table,"" Carney said.

Other aides have warned against a rush to judgment, citing flawed intelligence about non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before the 2003 invasion of that country."

White House spokesman says aim of whatever actions the U.S. takes will be limited.

Obama has long called for Assad to step down%2C but response options %22are not about regime change.%22

Intelligence report on last week%27s chemical attack may be released this week.

WASHINGTON — As President Obama weighs with his national security team how he will respond to Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons, his chief spokesman said Tuesday that the actions Obama is contemplating won't lead to the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

The White House continued to publicly maintain Tuesday that Obama has made no decision on the nature of his response to the Assad regime, even as lawmakers and government officials warned that a limited military strike against Syria is imminent.

At the same time, the White House sought to make clear that whatever Obama decides, the aim of his actions will be limited.

Obama has long called for the ouster of Assad and his administration has demanded accountability in the aftermath of last week's chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus. But White House spokesman Jay Carney stated plainly that Obama is not considering using American military might to oust Assad.

""I want to make clear that the options that we are considering are not about regime change,"" Carney said while reiterating that Obama continues to believe the 2½-year conflict must end with Assad out of power. ""They are about responding to a clear violation of international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons.""

Pressed by reporters on why Obama has ruled out using U.S. action to topple Assad, Carney responded, ""It is not our policy position to respond to this through regime change. We will take an appropriate response, and the president and his team are evaluating the options to them. And the president will make an assessment and an announcement in due time.""

Meanwhile, Carney said that an intelligence report detailing what the administration knows about last week's chemical attack would likely be released this week. The report could provide Obama with the legal and moral evidence to carry out a strike without seeking approval from United Nations or Congress.

Carney sidestepped questions on whether Obama felt there was a need to seek backing from the U.N. before carrying out its response to Syria. At the same time, Carney stressed that ""there isn't any doubt"" that chemical weapons were use on a ""significant scale"" establishing Syria's transgression

""Broadly speaking, I think it's important to note that it's in the clear national security interests of the United States that the use and proliferation of chemical weapons on this scale not go unanswered,"" Carney said.

Obama and Vice President Biden continued to reach out to allies Tuesday to discuss the situation in Syria. The president spoke by phone with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper while Biden called Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to discuss the situation.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke with his counterparts in Great Britain and France — two close allies who have called for intervention in Syria — to discuss the recent chemical weapons attack, raising speculation that a military strike against the Assad regime is imminent."

State Department issued warnings because of possible attacks

Agency has warned against traveling to many parts of the Middle East

Situation in Lebanon portrayed as especially dangerous

The U.S. Department of State has issued warnings against traveling to Lebanon and Turkey because of the possibility of attacks against U.S. citizens.

The Friday warnings come after a State Department order for a drawdown of non-emergency government personnel and their families in Beirut, Lebanon, and Adana, Turkey.

So far this summer, the State Department has issued several warnings for travel throughout the Middle East, including to Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.

The warning for Lebanon says ""all travel"" should be avoided because the potential for a ""spontaneous upsurge in violence remains."" The warning for Turkey says U.S. citizens should avoid the southeastern part of the country. It does not specifically mention Istanbul, a popular destination in northwest Turkey.

John Rendeiro, vice president of global security and intelligence for International SOS, which provides assistance to travelers abroad, says the State Department seems to be making preparations for possible U.S.-led military intervention in Syria.

""This is sort of preparing in the event that there is a military strike and some kind of action in Syria that will lead to retaliation by Syria and its allies,"" he says. ""If they are taking measures warning their own employees about the threat, they have to notify the public about that.""

The State Department portrayed the situation in Lebanon, which shares a border with Syria, as especially dangerous for U.S. citizens.

Lebanese government authorities, the State Department warning says, can't guarantee the protection of visitors if violence should break out.

""Access to borders, airports, roads and seaports can be interrupted with little or no warning,"" the warning says. ""Public demonstrations occur frequently with little warning and have the potential to become violent. Family, neighborhood or sectarian disputes often escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with little or no warning. The ability of U.S. government personnel to reach travelers or provide emergency services may be severely limited.""

The State Department says that a number of extremist groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah, which the U.S. government has designated a terrorist organization.

Hezbollah and other paramilitary groups have been known to detain foreigners for ""political motivations as well as for interrogation – sometimes for hours or longer,"" the warning says. Kidnapping is also a problem.

Travelers should particularly stay away from the border regions between Lebanon and Syria because the conflict in Syria has led to incidents there that have resulted in deaths in some cases, the warning says.

Lebanon's conflicts with Israel can also pose a problem for travelers.

""Rocket attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel have occurred in the past and remain a potential threat,"" the warning says. ""These attacks frequently provoke a military response from Israel. The rocket attacks and responses occur with no warning.""

As for Turkey, the State Department says that there have been no direct attacks on U.S. citizens but that travelers should still avoid demonstrations and large gatherings because they can escalate into violence.

The State Department says anyone who has to travel to the two countries should enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive updates and make it easier for the U.S. Embassy to stay in touch.

U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon, in particular, should ""keep a low profile, assess their personal security and vary times and routes for all required travel,"" the warning says."

Some of the pupils were burned alive in the latest school attack blamed on a radical terror group, survivors said.

Parents screamed in anguish as they tried to identify the charred and gunshot victims.

Farmer Malam Abdullahi found the bodies of two of his sons, a 10-year-old shot in the back as he apparently tried to run away, and a 12-year-old shot in the chest.

""That's it, I'm taking my other boys out of school,"" he told The Associated Press as he wept over the two corpses. He said he had three younger children in a nearby school.

""It's not safe,"" he said. ""The gunmen are attacking schools and there is no protection for students despite all the soldiers.""

Survivors at the Potiskum General Hospital and its mortuary said gunmen attacked Government Secondary School in Mamudo village, 3 miles from Potiskum town at about 3 a.m. Saturday.

The gunmen are believed to be from the Boko Haram sect whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege.""

They killed 29 students and an English teacher Mohammed Musa, who was shot in the chest, according to another teacher, Ibrahim Abdu.

""We were sleeping when we heard gunshots. When I woke up, someone was pointing a gun at me,"" said 15-year-old Musa Hassan.

He put his arm up in defense, and suffered a gunshot that blew off all four fingers on his right hand, the one he uses to write with.

He said the gunmen came armed with jerry cans of fuel that they used to torch the school's administrative block and one of the hostels.

""They burned the children alive,"" he said, the horror showing in his wide eyes.

He and teachers at the morgue said dozens of children from the 1,200-student school escaped into the bush but have not been seen since.

Some bodies are so charred they could not be identified, so many parents do not know if their children survived or died.

Islamic militants from Boko Haram and breakaway groups have killed more than 1,600 civilians in suicide bombings and other attacks since 2010, according to an Associated Press count.

Scores of schools have been burned down in the past year in northeast Nigeria.

President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency May 14, and deployed thousands of troops to halt the insurgency, acknowledging that militants had taken control of some towns and villages.

The military has claimed success in regaining control of the area — the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe . However, the area covers some 155,000 square kilometers (60,000 square miles) or one-sixth of the sprawling country.

Soldiers say they have killed and arrested hundreds of fighters.

But the crackdown, including attacks with fighter jets and helicopter gunships on militant camps, appears to have driven the extremists into rocky mountains with caves, from which they emerge to attack schools and markets.

The militants have increasingly targeted civilians, including health workers on vaccination campaigns, teachers and government workers.

Farmers have been driven from their land by the extremists and by military roadblocks, raising the specter of a food shortage to add to the woes of a people already hampered by the military's shutdown of cell phone service and ban on using satellite telephones."

The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and two top generals this week, requesting more information about the project in Helmand Province.

The 64,000-square foot building was commissioned by the Army in February 2010 to be the Command and Control Facility for Regional Command Southwest during the surge.

But, in May 2010, even before construction began, the Marine commander in the area submitted a request to U.S. Forces Afghanistan to cancel the project.

Despite that request, the following year, in February 2011, the Air Force issued an order to British-based AMEC Earth and Environment Inc. to construct the facility and, in November 2012, the U.S. government took over the facility.

In his letter, dated July 8, Sopko said the military knew the building would not be used for its original purpose well before construction began. He asked Hagel, as well as Gen. Joseph Dunford and Gen. Lloyd Austin, to explain why construction ever began.

Sopko also asked them to find out whether another facility had been built to replace the unused building.

And he questioned whether turning the building over to the Afghan government was possible, given that the Afghans might not have the technical capacity or money to maintain it.

Plastic covers are still on seats inside what was designed to be a command and control facility in Helmand Province. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Recon

""According to a senior U.S. military official, as the footprint of Camp Leatherneck decreases, the building could be outside the security perimeter, thereby making it unsafe for the U.S. military to occupy it. This leaves the military with two primary options -- demolish the building or give it to the Afghan government,” he said in the letter.

“Due to an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment at this time,” NATO’s International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan replied when asked for comment about the investigation by NBC News.

Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said that the Pentagon was ""viewing the report,"" and had nothing more to add to it.

He was not sure when Hagel would provide a formal response.

Their options include offering asylum to the former U.S. contractor, who says he leaked National Security Agency secrets and is expected to face criminal charges; interrogating him; or urging him to leave.

So far, officials in Beijing look to be playing it cool by doing nothing — and that, several experts said Friday, is perhaps the savviest thing they could do.

With some U.S. lawmakers calling Snowden, 29, a traitor and raising questions about whether he has a relationship with a foreign government, any moves by Beijing to contact Snowden could inflame tension with Washington just days after a summit between President Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Given that it’s unclear whether Snowden has information that would be particularly valuable to the Chinese — and whether he’d be willing to share it if he did — it’s a risk Beijing may not yet be ready to take.

At the same time, any immediate effort by Beijing to grant Snowden permanent haven or urge him to depart for another locale could raise hackles in Hong Kong.

Though the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, it retains its own Western-based legal system and enjoys greater civil liberties than the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents see the Snowden affair as a test of whether Beijing will honor its commitment to the “one country, two systems” policy or interfere before any legal process has been given a chance to play out.

Snowden, who revealed himself Sunday as the primary source of unauthorized disclosures of highly classified U.S. telephone and Internet surveillance systems, remains free in Hong Kong, where U.S. visitors are customarily allowed to stay 90 days.

Hong Kong authorities are unlikely to arrest him, experts said, until Washington makes a formal extradition request, or until he overstays his 90-day tourist visa or is found to be in violation of Hong Kong law. At that time, they could detain him — and confiscate any belongings, potentially including his computer files — while they determine his fate.

“This is a win-win for China,” said David Zweig, director of the Center on China’s Transnational Relations at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “I don’t see them losing at this point, the fact that he’s here, running away from the United States with all this information … whether he goes back or whether he goes free. I don’t see this as bad for China.”

Ideally for officials in Beijing, Zweig said, “if they don’t have to get involved and Hong Kong arrests him, and they get the computer, they win.”

Law Yuk-kai, director of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, said the Chinese government would be happy to see the case drag on and embarrass the U.S.

“It is a setback for people who want the U.S. to restrain China in its abuse of Internet freedom,” he said.

Snowden’s whereabouts in Hong Kong remained unclear Friday, and there was no indication that he had retained legal counsel.

He told the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, this week that among the targets of NSA hacking in the territory was Chinese University of Hong Kong, home to the Hong Kong Internet Exchange, a network backbone through which Web traffic in the city passes.

Several legal specialists said they believed Snowden’s continuing disclosures to the media could complicate his case.

Professor Simon N.M. Young, director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, said that if Snowden disclosed hacking that was based on information provided in confidence by China or Hong Kong to the U.S. government, he could be in violation of Hong Kong’s Official Secrets Ordinance.

Nevertheless, even if Snowden is detained by Hong Kong police, he will not be obligated to speak with Chinese intelligence authorities, Young said.

“We have a very strong protection to the right to silence in Hong Kong,” Young said. “If there are visitors at the jail, he can just say no.”

Zweig said Snowden would have at least two reasons — one practical, one moral — not to talk to the Chinese: First, it could complicate his case if he was extradited to the U.S., and second, he would be discussing matters with a government that “are not such great guys on this issue.”

“They spy on their people, and not just to get terrorists … [but] just for straight repression,” he said.

Snowden has told local media that he intends to stay in Hong Kong and fight the U.S. in court. His options are unclear. The British government has warned airlines around the world not to let Snowden fly to Britian, the Associated Press reported Friday.

The longer Snowden remains in limbo in Hong Kong, though, the louder calls may grow for officials there and in Beijing to take a more active stance on the case.

The Global Times, a Communist Party-affiliated newspaper, noted in an editorial Friday that “Snowden is a ‘card’ that China never expected” to be dealt and that China is “neither adept at nor used to playing it.”

But the publication urged Beijing authorities not only to “explicitly demand a reasonable explanation from the U.S. government” about the alleged hacking but also to “acquire more solid information from Snowden if he has it, and use it as evidence to negotiate with the U.S.”

Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council said it would meet next week to look into issues raised by Snowden’s disclosures. Lawmakers plan to ask officials how they plan to react to any requests from the U.S. regarding Snowden.

One member of the council, Claudia Mo Man-ching, publicly took Hong Kong’s chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, to task over his reluctance to comment on the Snowden case, telling the South China Morning Post he has “no guts and no backbone” and suggesting he is merely waiting for orders from Beijing on how to handle Snowden.

A coalition of democratic and human rights groups planned to march Saturday on the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong. The rally is not only a show of support for Snowden, organizers said, but also a protest against U.S. surveillance activities and a critique of what they see as the chief executive’s failure to forcefully assert the primacy of Hong Kong’s legal system in handling the case.

In Egyptian Sinai just hours later, thousands of Islamists rallied under the black flag of jihad and cheered widely at calls for “a war council” to roll back Mr. Morsi’s ouster. “The age of peacefulness is over,” the speaker declared in a video of the rally. “No more peacefulness after today.”

“No more election after today,” the crowd chanted in response.

After a night of deadly clashes at Cairo University that accompanied the takeover, some ultraconservative Islamists gathered there said their experiment in electoral politics — a deviation from God’s law to begin with — had come to a bad end.

“Didn’t we do what they asked,” asked Mahmoud Taha, 40, a merchant. “We don’t believe in democracy to begin with; it’s not part of our ideology. But we accepted it. We followed them, and then this is what they do?”

In Syria, where the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood once hoped to provide a model of moderation and democracy, some fighters battling President Bashar al-Assad now say it is the other way around. Egyptian Islamists “may have to pursue the armed option,” said Firas Filefleh, a rebel fighter in an Islamist brigade in Idlib, in northern Syria. “That may be the only choice, as it was for us in Syria.”

In the United Arab Emirates, where the authoritarian government just sentenced 69 members of a Brotherhood-linked Islamist group to prison in an effort to stop the spread of Arab spring revolts, Islamists said the crackdowns were driving a deeper wedge into their movement.

“The practices that we see today will split the Islamists in half,” said Saeed Nasar Alteneji, a former head of the Emirates group, the Islah association. “There are those who always call for centrism and moderation and peaceful political participation,” he said. “The other group condemns democracy and sees today that the West and others will never accept the ballot box if it brings Islamists to power.”"

The Afghan government, meanwhile, abruptly canceled a ceremony scheduled for Saturday that had been meant to show that Kabul and Washington had finally reached a deal for the handover of a U.S. military prison. At the last minute, Afghan President Hamid Karzai balked at the proposed terms of the handover of the Parwan Detention Facility, Afghan and U.S. officials said, dashing hopes that a resolution of a contentious issue that has poisoned the relationship between the two countries was in sight.

“There is frustration when it comes to the issue of Afghan sovereignty in the prison transfer, and when we see that what we asked for is not respected,” said Aimal Faizi, Karzai’s spokesman. “Whenever it happens again, our position will be the same.”

Afghan officials say they will not extend veto power to the United States when it comes to the release of detainees, even a small group of high-profile prisoners of particular concern to U.S. officials. That issue has long appeared to be intractable, given U.S. concern that dangerous insurgents would promptly return to the battlefield upon being released.

On Saturday night, Karzai issued a statement saying the prison handover would occur in the coming week, but it was not clear whether it reflected an aspiration or an actual resolution.

Hagel’s first full day in Kabul as defense chief started ominously, as a suicide bomber riding a bicycle detonated explosives outside the main gate of the Defense Ministry, a rare security breach in one of the capital’s most heavily policed areas. Nine people were killed and 10 were wounded, Mohammed Daud Amin, the deputy police commander of Kabul, said. The majority of the victims were civilians.

Less than an hour later, a man detonated a vest loaded with explosives near the capital of the eastern Khost province, killing eight children and one police officer, said Mobarez Zadran, a provincial spokesman. Afghan officials said the man was targeting a joint U.S.-Afghan military patrol when he was stopped by the police officer, which led him to trigger the explosive device. The slain children were playing in the area at the time, officials said.

“We’re at war,” Hagel said later, speaking to reporters at a military base in Jalalabad, also in the east, where he traveled to meet with U.S. troops. “War didn’t stop. That’s just the reality.”

A Taliban spokesman said the group had carried out Saturday’s attack in Kabul in an effort to prevent Hagel from “spreading lies” about the insurgency’s weakness.

Violence was not the only disappointment of the day.

U.S. and Afghan officials have been at odds for more than a year over the fate of detainees in American custody in Afghanistan. Karzai wants the Americans to cease detention operations entirely, but U.S. officials have insisted on a phased handover of their detention system, arguing that an abrupt handover would be dangerous.

Karzai balked on Friday to a few of the terms Afghan and American negotiators had reached in the latest round of talks, prompting the Afghan government to hastily scrap the ceremony at the Parwan facility, which would have presented an image of synergy between Washington and Kabul during Hagel’s visit.

“The Parwan deal has been a long time in the making,” a senior defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the dispute. “There have been a few hiccups at the end.”

The official said the terms Karzai has not agreed to are “not terribly substantial,” adding that these disputes have become part and parcel of the U.S.-Afghan relationship. “This happens frequently, especially with the Afghans,” the official said.

Aside from the issue of veto power, Karzai raised concerns about the importance of sharing U.S. intelligence about Afghan detainees. Although some of that intelligence could be declassified and given to Afghans, much of it will remain restricted in accordance with American national security policy.

If U.S. officials want to interrogate a detainee more than 96 hours after his capture, Faizi said, Karzai has stipulated that those officials must submit a formal request to an Afghan review board before gaining access to the prison.

“When the final draft was presented to the president, he decided several changes needed to be made at the last minute,” Faizi said. “He worried that the language used raised questions about sovereignty.”

Beyond the detention issue, Karzai has sought to curb U.S. military authority by calling for the expulsion of special forces from a key eastern province that serves as a gateway to the capital. Karzai called for U.S. elite troops to leave Wardak province by Sunday after accusing them two weeks ago of committing abuses. But a coalition official told reporters Saturday that that deadline is not firm and officials are holding out hope that the Afghan government will reconsider that position.

“There’s a little bit of space in terms of the exact date,” said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity. The official said that a probe into the Wardak allegations has “found no evidence of misconduct by our forces.”

Hagel said he was hopeful a resolution would be reached, but he offered no details."

Baltasar Garzón, the renowned Spanish jurist who advises WikiLeaks, said in a statement that “what is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange — for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest — is an assault against the people.”

Obama administration officials privately expressed frustration that Hong Kong allowed Mr. Snowden to board an Aeroflot plane bound for Moscow on Sunday despite the American request for his detention. But they did not revoke Mr. Snowden’s passport until Saturday and did not ask Interpol to issue a “red notice” seeking his arrest.

An administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said no red notice was requested because they are “most valuable when the whereabouts of a fugitive are unknown.” Mr. Snowden was known to be in Hong Kong, so his provisional arrest was sought under an existing American agreement with Hong Kong.

On Sunday, the Hong Kong authorities said that the American arrest request “did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law,” and therefore they could not legally stop Mr. Snowden from leaving. The Justice Department rejected this explanation and provided a timeline of interactions suggesting that the Hong Kong authorities first requested “additional information” on Friday.

“At no point, in all of our discussions through Friday, did the authorities in Hong Kong raise any issues regarding the sufficiency of the U.S.'s provisional arrest request,” a department official said. “In light of this, we find their decision to be particularly troubling.”

By the end of the day American officials, unsure whether Mr. Snowden was actually heading to Ecuador, or possibly Cuba or Venezuela, as also variously reported, were sending messages to an array of possible destinations."

(CNN) —

If North Korea continues with its controversial missile and nuclear tests, it “will move closer” to its objective of reaching the United States with nuclear weapons, according to a Pentagon report.

During recent heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Pyongyang repeatedly threatened the possibility of nuclear attacks against the United States and South Korea, prompting questions on the progress of its weapons program.

North Korea’s secretiveness has made it hard for Western intelligence agencies to gauge exactly what is going on inside its research facilities.

Many clues have come from the regime’s large-scale tests such as the long-range rocket launch in December and the underground nuclear detonation in February.

The Pentagon’s annual report to Congress on Thursday provided an overview of the military threat posed by North Korea, but it didn’t say how long it believed it would take the isolated, Stalinist state to develop a fully operational nuclear missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.

It described North Korea’s ballistic missile program as “ambitious” and said that “the pace of its progress will depend, in part, on how many resources it can dedicate to these efforts and how often it conducts tests.”

Doubts over North’s capabilities

A sign of differing views on North Korea’s nuclear missile capabilities among U.S. intelligence agencies emerged last month.

Addressing the House Armed Services Committee, a congressman read out an excerpt from a report by the Pentagon’s intelligence arm that said it believed with “moderate confidence” that the North had nuclear weapons that could be delivered by ballistic missiles, albeit with low “reliability.”

But after the disclosure of that assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), top U.S. officials including President Barack Obama said the U.S. government didn’t think North Korea was yet able to fit a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile.

The Pentagon report Thursday included no reference to the DIA excerpt, which didn’t specify the range of the ballistic missiles that it was talking about.

The report said that the type of long-range rocket that North Korea launched in December to put a satellite in orbit “could reach parts of the United States if configured as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of carrying a nuclear payload.”

But it noted that “a space launch does not test a re-entry vehicle (RV), without which North Korea cannot deliver a weapon to target from an ICBM.”

The December launch and the display in April 2012 of an untested but road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile help underscore “the threat to regional stability and U.S. national security posed by North Korea,” according to the report.

Like father, like son

Its authors said they didn’t expect much change under North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, from the strategy shaped by his father, Kim Jong Il, who died in December 2011.

The focus of that approach, they said, includes “coercive diplomacy to compel acceptance of its diplomatic, economic and security interests; development of strategic military capabilities to deter external attack;” and challenges to South Korea and the U.S.-South Korean alliance.

Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has so far continued the pursuit of more advanced nuclear and missile technologies, which according to the report, the regime sees as “essential to its goals of survival, sovereignty and relevance.”

The long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February prompted international condemnation and tougher U.N. sanctions. Those measures were followed by intensified threats from Pyongyang, during which the United States said it would deploy additional missile defenses on its West Coast.

The Pentagon report also highlighted the murkiness of the North’s decision-making processes – a particular concern during periods of heightened tensions like the past few months.

“Although North Korea is unlikely to attack on a scale that it assesses would risk the survival of its government by inviting overwhelming counterattacks by the ROK or the United States, we do not know how North Korea calculates this threshold of behavior,” the report said, using the abbreviated form of South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.

“North Korea’s use of smallscale attacks and provocative acts leaves much room for miscalculation that could spiral into a larger conflict,” it said.

http://news.yahoo.com/u-sends-submarine-hunting-jets-japan-amid-east-064511364--finance.html,,[],U.S. sends new submarine-hunting jets to Japan amid East Asia tension,"By Tim Kelly and Phil Stewart TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy's first two advanced P-8A Poseidon patrol aircraft have arrived in Japan, U.S. military officials said on Monday, helping to upgrade America's ability to hunt submarines and other vessels in seas close to China as tension in the region mounts. The initial deployment - another four of the aircraft are due to arrive in the coming days - was planned before China last month established an air defense identification zone covering islands controlled by Japan and claimed by Beijing. The Pentagon says it is routinely flying operations in the region, including in China's newly declared air defense zone, without informing Beijing ahead of time. One U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters these routine operations include surveillance flights. The deployment of the P-8As came before U.S. Vice President Joe Biden left for Asia this week, where he is seeking to strike a balance between calming military tensions with China and supporting Japan as it wrangles with Beijing over the islands. The P-8As, built by Boeing Co based on its 737 passenger plane, were been built to replace the aging propeller-powered Lockheed Martin P-3 Orion patrol aircraft, which have been in service for 50 years. Equipped with the latest radar equipment and armed with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, the P-8A is able to fly further and stay out on a mission longer than the P-3. ""The P-8A is the most advanced long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft in the world,"" the Pentagon said. Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Pool, a Pentagon spokesman, said the first two P-8As arrived in Japan on Sunday. The other four were expected to arrive there later this week, a Navy spokeswoman said. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the deployment came at a moment of region tensions. The official said the timing was a coincidence, but one that would bolster the U.S. military's efforts to monitor the maritime environment in the region. That includes the area around the disputed islands, known to the Japanese as the Senkakus and to the Chinese as the Daioyu, the official said. Washington takes no position on the sovereignty of the islands. However, it recognizes Tokyo's administrative control and says the U.S.-Japan security pact applies to them, a stance that could drag the United States into a military conflict it would prefer to avoid.

Such a change under the new president, Hassan Rouhani, would be a significant departure for Iran in the nuclear talks. Mr. Rouhani, a moderate cleric who won the presidency in June over his more conservative rivals, has pledged to reduce tensions with the West over the nuclear issue, which has left Iran increasingly isolated and economically troubled by punitive sanctions.

Mr. Rouhani’s choice for foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was confirmed by Parliament last week. The signals that Mr. Zarif would lead the nuclear negotiations were conveyed on Tuesday at a regular weekly news conference in Tehran by the Foreign Ministry spokesman, which was broadcast by Iran’s Press TV Web site.

“Over the past 10 to 12 years, the negotiator has been the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. This may change,” said the spokesman, Abbas Araqchi. “Rouhani may decide to appoint somebody else. Maybe the foreign minister, or anyone else that he deems fit.”"

Kerry and his Russian counterpart huddled Thursday in Geneva in a push to disarm Syria of chemical weapons, even as Syrian President Bashar Assad warned that he wouldn’t surrender his toxic arsenal unless the Obama administration stopped arming rebels battling to overthrow his government.

Assad’s comments suggested another hurdle for the hastily arranged talks, which were already fraught with considerable risk, and threatened a separate diplomatic process at the United Nations. They underscored the limits of Moscow’s leverage over the embattled Syrian ruler, who faces a mortal threat from insurgents in a bitter civil war.

Neither Kerry nor Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov directly responded to Assad’s demands when they met with reporters. Both sought to project optimism about resolving the crisis that erupted after the U.S. said that more than 1,000 Syrians were killed in poison gas attacks outside Damascus last month.

“We do believe there is a way to get this done,” Kerry said. But he repeated President Obama’s warning that if diplomacy failed, “force might be necessary to deter and degrade Assad’s capacity to deliver these weapons.”

“We proceed from the fact that the solution of this problem will make unnecessary” any U.S. airstrikes on Syria, Lavrov said.

Both diplomats brought teams of arms control experts, legal specialists and other aides to the talks, which are taking place in the Swiss city where the first ban on poison gas was signed nearly a century ago after the horrors of World War I.

In brief comments at the White House, Obama said he hoped the negotiations “can yield a concrete result.” He said Kerry would work hard “over the next several days to see what the possibilities are.”

The talks represent Moscow’s attempt to reclaim a dominant position on the world stage after years of decline, and have cast Russian President Vladimir Putin in the unlikely role of peacemaker. He vowed this week to force Assad’s government to let international monitors impound, safeguard and ultimately destroy Syria’s chemical weapons.

After weeks of insisting that America’s credibility was on the line in Syria, and months of tension and chilly relations with Moscow, the White House sought Thursday to shift the spotlight — and at least some of the responsibility — to the Russian leader.

“It is clear that President Putin has invested his credibility in transferring Assad’s chemical weapons to international control and ultimately destroying them,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. “This is significant. Russia is Assad’s patron and protector, and the world will note whether Russia can follow through on the commitments that it’s made.”

Kerry and Lavrov have met nearly a dozen times this year, and Kerry has called Russia a crucial partner in trying to end the Syrian conflict and resolve the chemical weapons crisis. But U.S. officials worry that Putin is simply trying to avert U.S. airstrikes and buy time for his ally in Damascus.

Many diplomats and analysts say the Obama administration holds a weak hand in the talks. On Tuesday, Obama said he was withdrawing his request for Congress to authorize military action in Syria to give diplomacy time. But it was clear by then that the House, and perhaps the Senate, was unlikely to support the president’s plea for use of force.

Advertisement

Christopher Chivvis, a Pentagon official during the first Obama term, said he viewed airstrikes without congressional support as “not impossible, but increasingly unlikely.” He said the diplomatic efforts “could lead backward” if they unraveled in the weeks ahead and Obama refrained from retaliatory strikes.

“Then you’re in a worse position, because Assad still has his weapons and the message to the world is that you can use them without punishment,” said Chivvis, who is now with the Rand Corp., a nonpartisan think tank.

In addition to the sit-down in Geneva, Syrian diplomats in New York gave U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon a document declaring Syria’s willingness to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty that bans the production, storage or use of poison gas. Nearly 200 countries have already signed it.

The treaty, which went into force in 1997, would bring Syria’s disarmament under the supervision of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an independent international organization based in The Hague. It has no military enforcement powers and thus is dependent on each country’s cooperation.

Both Russia and the United States, the two countries with the largest stockpiles of chemical arms, are still working to destroy their toxic arsenals under the treaty’s provisions.

Assad said in an interview with the Rossiya-24 Russian news network that he was willing to sign the treaty. But he said that under its provisions, Syria would have a month to begin handing over details of its stockpiles to international monitors. That time frame is considerably longer than U.S. officials seek, and it’s unclear if it will prove acceptable.

Assad also said Syria would not participate unless other countries made important concessions.

“These mechanisms will not be fulfilled unilaterally,” he said. “When we see that the United States really wants stability in our region, will stop their threats and attack plans, and stop their arms supplies to terrorists, then we will consider that we can go ahead and complete the necessary processes so that they can be valid and acceptable for Syria. There are no one-sided mechanisms.”

Assad also demanded that Israel give up its nuclear weapons before he will comply. Israel does not acknowledge possessing nuclear weapons.

Igor Korotchenko, editor of the Moscow journal National Defense, said the Syrian leader was speaking to his own supporters, as well as the international community, in his attempts to bargain.

“Assad is trying to get away with as many bonuses as he can get,” Korotchenko said. “To expect Washington to stop aiding the rebels is unrealistic, and the Syrian leader must understand it full well. He needs to avert a U.S. strike and he is bidding for time trying to get some tactical advantages.”

The U.S., French, British and other governments also are exploring the possibility of a U.N. Security Council resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. That could offer a legal mandate for the use of military force if Syria breaches its obligations under the treaty.

But Russia and China have made it clear they would veto such a resolution, citing their opposition to military action. Russia has suggested instead passing a nonbinding U.N. declaration called a “presidential statement.”

The options facing Obama “are just not that good,” said Michael Singh, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush who is now managing director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

USA TODAY

Snowden is seeking ultimate refuge in Latin America

He wants to stay temporarily in Russia

U.S.-Russia relations under strain

Intelligence leaker Edward Snowden formally submitted an application for temporary asylum in Russia on Tuesday, his lawyer said.

Snowden argued in his application that he needs asylum because ""he faces persecution by the U.S. government and he fears for his life and safety, fears that he could be subjected to torture and capital punishment,"" lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said on Russian television.

The former NSA systems analyst has been living in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since arriving from Hong Kong on June 23. Snowden said Friday at a meeting with Russian rights activists and public figures that he would seek at least temporary refuge in Russia until he could fly to one of the Latin American nations that have offered him asylum.

The application may not be welcome news to President Vladimir Putin.

Putin has characterized the National Security Agency leaker's long stay at a Moscow airport as an unwelcome present foisted on Russia by the U.S. He says the U.S. intimidated other countries against accepting Snowden, effectively blocking him from flying further.

When asked about Snowden's future, Russia media quoted Putin as saying, ""Such a present to us. Merry Christmas.""

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-syria-support-former-foe-mccain-072931290--politics.html,,[],Obama seeks Syria support from former foe McCain,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama, seeking a congressional endorsement for U.S. military intervention in civil war-wracked Syria, is inviting two leading Capitol Hill foreign policy hawks to the White House in efforts to sell the idea to a nation deeply scarred by more than a decade of war.

Having announced over the weekend that he'll seek congressional approval for military strikes against the Assad regime, the Obama administration is now trying to rally support among Americans and persuade members of Congress with an array of views on Syria.

Sen. John McCain, Obama's White House opponent in 2008, will be joined for the talks later Monday by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who like McCain has argued that Obama must not only punish the Syrian regime with surgical missile strikes but must seek to change the course of the civil war and oust President Bashar Assad from power.

Obama has said he wants limited military action to respond to an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that the U.S. says included sarin gas and killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of whom were children.

McCain and Graham, both Republicans, represent the most aggressive faction in Congress and have called on Obama to launch more comprehensive strikes with an aim of destroying President Bashar Assad's air power, his military command and control, Syria's ballistic missiles, and other military targets while at the same time increasing training and arming of opposition forces.

On the other side of the spectrum, some Republican and Democratic lawmakers don't want to see military action at all.

Members of the House Democratic caucus were to participate in an unclassified conference call Monday with Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The White House is engaging in what officials call a ""flood the zone"" persuasion strategy with Congress, arguing that failure to act against Assad would weaken any deterrence against the use of chemical weapons and could embolden not only Assad but also Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Story continues

Obama's turnabout decision to seek congressional authority on Syria sets the stage for the biggest foreign policy vote in Congress since the Iraq war.

On Sunday, Kerry said the U.S. received new physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that shows sarin gas was used in the Aug. 21 attack. Kerry said the U.S. must respond with its credibility on the line.

""We know that the regime ordered this attack,"" he said. ""We know they prepared for it. We know where the rockets came from. We know where they landed. We know the damage that was done afterwards.""

On Capitol Hill Sunday, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in private to explain why the U.S. was compelled to act against Assad. Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough also made calls to individual lawmakers.

In addition to Monday's meetings and briefings, further sessions were planned for Tuesday and Wednesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans a meeting Tuesday, according to its chairman, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. The Senate Armed Service Committee will gather a day later, said Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the panel.

""The American people deserve to hear more from the administration about why military action in Syria is necessary, what it will achieve and how it will be sufficiently limited to keep the U.S. from being drawn further into the Syrian conflict,"" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, reflecting a more cautious approach to a military strike.

McCain said Obama asked him to come to the White House specifically to discuss Syria.

""It can't just be, in my view, pinprick cruise missiles,"" the Arizona Republican told CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

In an interview with an Israeli television network, he said Obama has ""encouraged our enemies"" by effectively punting his decision to Congress. He and Graham have threatened to vote against Obama's authorization if the military plan doesn't seek to shift the momentum of the 2 ½ year civil war toward the rebels trying to oust Assad from power.

Obama is trying to convince Americans and the world about the need for action.

So far, he is finding few international partners willing to engage in a conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the past 2½ years and dragged in terrorist groups on both sides of the battlefield.

Only France is firmly on board among the major military powers. Britain's Parliament rejected the use of force in a vote last week.

Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said Monday the information the U.S. showed Moscow to prove the Syrian regime was behind the chemical attack was ""absolutely unconvincing.""

With Navy ships on standby in the eastern Mediterranean ready to launch missiles, Congress on Sunday began a series of meetings that are expected to continue over the next several days in preparation for a vote once lawmakers return from summer break, which is scheduled to end Sept. 9.

Senior administration officials gave a two-hour classified briefing to dozens of members of Congress in the Capitol on Sunday.

Lawmakers expressed a range of opinions coming out of the meeting, from outright opposition to strident support for Obama's request for the authorization to use force.

Among Democrats, Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan said he'd approve Obama's request and predicted it would pass. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland said he was concerned the authorization might be ""too broad."" Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the senior Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the administration still has ""work to do with respect to shoring up the facts of what happened.""

Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said she was concerned about what Congress was being asked to approve. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said the war resolution needed tightening.

""I don't think Congress is going to accept it as it is,"" Sessions said.

MANAGUA, July 5 (Reuters) - Nicaragua has received an asylum request from fugitive former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden and could accept the bid ""if circumstances permit,"" President Daniel Ortega said on Friday.

""We are an open country, respectful of the right of asylum, and it's clear that if circumstances permit, we would gladly receive Snowden and give him asylum in Nicaragua,"" Ortega said during a speech in the Nicaraguan capital Managua.

Ortega, an ally of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, did not elaborate on the conditions that would allow him to offer asylum to Snowden, who has been at the eye of a diplomatic storm since leaking high-level U.S. intelligence data last month.

Options have been narrowing for Snowden - believed to be staying in a transit area at a Moscow airport - as he seeks a country to shelter him from U.S. espionage charges.

A one-time Cold War adversary of the United States, Ortega belongs to a bloc of leftist leaders in Latin America that have frequently taken up antagonistic positions with Washington.

Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in the Americas, has benefited greatly from financial support from Venezuela, and Ortega was a staunch ally of late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez.

Chavez's successor Maduro voiced sympathy with Snowden and described him as a champion of human rights. That suggested Venezuela may help Snowden, who is stranded in Moscow after flying there from Hong Kong on June 23, to find a safe haven.

Snowden's bid for Icelandic citizenship hit an impasse earlier on Friday when the country's parliament voted not to debate it before the summer recess.

Afterwards, WikiLeaks announced that Snowden had applied to another six countries for asylum, adding to a list of more than a dozen countries which he has already asked for protection.

The anti-secrecy organization, which has been supporting Snowden's efforts to find a safe haven since his exit from Hong Kong 12 days ago, said on Twitter it could not reveal the names the countries due to ""attempted U.S. interference"". (Reporting by Ivan Castro; Editing by Philip Barbara)"

(CNN) —

U.S. officials were pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the initial declaration that Syria has submitted to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog outlining its inventory of the munitions, a senior administration official said Saturday.

The official said the declaration was more complete than what the officials had expected the Syrians to put forth.

The news came hours after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced that Syria had handed over a list of what it says is its chemical arms stockpile.

“The Technical Secretariat is currently reviewing the information received,” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The handover occurred a day before the organization is to meet at The Hague in the Netherlands to discuss Syria.

The timing meets the terms set in a deal forged last week between the United States and Russia in Geneva to begin destroying Syria’s chemical arsenal.

Under the fast-tracked Geneva deal, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to declare the weapons no later than Saturday.

The normal 60-day process for declaring arms was expedited to seven days “because of the extraordinary concern about Syria’s weapons,” said Michael Luhan, a spokesman for the organization.

“Until now, each country has been typical. The United States, Russia, Libya, India, none have been in a state of war or conflict,” Luhan said Friday.

His organization planned to begin reviewing Monday, he said.

“We have to go through it in detail and plan how to conduct the on-the-ground inspection mission, to verify the accuracy of the declaration and put seals on all the materials to make sure they are secure,” Luhan said.

The stakes over halting the Syrian civil war heightened after an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people.

The United States and other Western nations blame the regime for the attack. Russia and Syria say they think rebels used the weapons.

Citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons, U.S. President Barack Obama called for authorization from Congress to use military force in Syria.

As the United States threatened force to degrade Assad’s ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks, a diplomatic opportunity arose between Russia and the United States to put Syria’s stockpile under international control.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hammered out a deal in Geneva last week compelling Syria to accept the agreement. Syria has agreed to it.

Speaking ahead of next week’s U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, Kerry said Thursday that while “the complete removal of Syria’s chemical weapons is possible here, through peaceful means,” urgency is needed.

The U.N. Security Council must be prepared to act next week, Kerry said, citing a U.N. chemical weapons report about the attack.

While the report did not assign responsibility for the attack, Kerry said it offered “crucial details,” making the case implicating Assad “only … more compelling.”

Russia called the report “distorted” and said it was based on insufficient information.

Even as diplomatic efforts were continuing, U.S. officials have not dropped their threat to use force and are wary, saying Syria could be using the diplomacy as a stalling tactic.

“Time is short,” Kerry said. “Let’s not spend time debating what we already know.”

Also on Saturday, the Syrian opposition coalition rejected an offer made by Iran to broker a peace deal between rebels and the government, calling it “ridiculous and desperate.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is also planning to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting, said he can help bring peace to Syria, a long-time Iranian ally torn by civil war.

In a Washington Post op-ed on Thursday, the recently elected Iranian president called for an end to “the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart.” And he signaled his desire for better engagement with the West.

Given Iran’s closeness to Syria’s government, it seems unlikely rebels would consider Rouhani an independent broker. But Rouhani’s tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And Rouhani’s promise of more positive engagement with the world during his election campaign appeared to propel him to victory.

“The Syrian National Coalition considers Iran’s offer as ridiculous amid all the bloodshed that Iran participated with the (Bashar) al-Assad regime, through political, economic support and military support during the past two and a half years.”

Rouhani, 65, has promised more positive engagement with the world.

But the Syrian opposition coalition said Iran is part of the problem.

“There is no doubt that Rouhani’s offer is a desperate attempt to prolong the crisis and increase the complexity,” the coalition said in a statement.

The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011, a period in which harsh government crackdowns against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.

Another 2 million people have fled their homeland, and more than 4.25 million have been displaced within Syria, the United Nations says.

More violence

Government forces killed at least 26 people Saturday in Hamas suburbs, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees. CNN could not independently verify the claim.

In a lengthy and wide-ranging email message, Mullah Mohammad Omar called on Afghans to boycott elections scheduled for early 2014 and urged Afghan police, soldiers and paramilitary personnel to turn their guns on foreign troops -- as well as Afghan government troops cooperating with U.S.-led coalition forces.

In a separate development, individual members of the Afghan High Peace Council -- a group appointed by President Hamid Karzai to negotiate with Taliban elements -- said Tuesday they’ve held secret talks with the Taliban to try to bring momentum to a peace process that’s foundered since its inception.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the statements were a deliberate lie designed to upstage his group’s important Eid message. “The High Peace Council wants to keep its office open and money flowing, which is why they are spouting such propaganda,” Mujahid said. “We don’t intend to talk with the puppet Kabul government. We don’t have contact with them, not individual talks, not group talks.”

The one-eyed Omar, who has a $10-million bounty on his head, has made a practice in recent years of distributing a message shortly before Eid al-Fitr, a three-day Islamic holiday celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan when devout Muslims pray and fast.

Omar said in the five-page letter that the Taliban recently set up an office in Doha, the capital of Qatar, to hasten the departure of foreign forces from Afghanistan and to form an inclusive government based on “Islamic principles.”

“We do not think of monopolizing power,” he wrote. “Those who truly love Islam and the country and have commitment to both ... this homeland is theirs.”

Omar also welcomed humanitarian organizations to Afghanistan as long as they don’t push “non-Islamic ways” on Afghans. In May, a suicide attack on the Red Cross compound in Jalalabad was widely condemned and prompted the aid group to pull back on its operations in Afghanistan. The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack, in which an Afghan guard was killed.

Omar’s message was particularly critical of the planned 2014 elections, which he called a “deceiving drama” all but decided in Washington. “Participation in such elections is only a waste of time, nothing more,” he said.

His stance is consistent with the Taliban’s attitude toward past Afghan elections, during which the group directed gunmen to target candidates and block roads leading to polling stations.

Omar’s message, tone and arguments suggest the group is out of touch, some analysts said. “As always, they’re trying to fuel panic and fear in people with this message,” said Abdul Wahid Taqat, a Kabul-based military analyst. “They know they’re not popular and couldn’t win an election, so they boycott.”

The group’s relatively welcoming message to international humanitarian groups is an attempt to win popularity among ordinary people that won’t work, Taqat added.

“If the Taliban respected humanitarian organizations, it wouldn’t kill innocent women and children every day,” he said. “These people don’t respect humanity, children, religion and Islam, how they can welcome humanitarian organizations? Whatever Mullah Omar has said in his Eid message is baseless.”

Members of Karzai’s inner circle said they’d held discreet discussions with the militant group on the possible framework for more formal peace talks. “There have been individual talks with the Taliban,” said Habibullah Fauzi, a High Peace Council member. “Talks have taken place many times.”

The opening of a Taliban political office in June in Qatar was mired in controversy, with Karzai highly critical of the office’s sign, flag and name, which he said was falsely meant to suggest that the group was a legitimate national representative.

Omar, who is suspected of living in Pakistan, has made no public appearances or speeches since he fled Afghanistan in late 2001 after U.S. forces invaded and toppled the Taliban. Afghanistan’s de facto head of state from 1996 to 2001, he is considered the Taliban’s spiritual leader.

Despite his elevated status within the militant group, relatively little is known about him other than descriptions that he’s tall, shy and reluctant to speak with foreigners.

PETERSBURG, Russia – President Obama arrived here Thursday for a summit of world leaders that will be dominated by discussion of U.S. preparations to attack Syria and the president’s attempts to find some measure of support from the G-20 nations.

But Obama’s Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was not there to greet him at the airport and didn’t send a high-ranking delegate. Instead, Putin met Obama as 33 world leaders checked in to begin two days of official meetings of the Group of 20 major economies, both smiling as they shook hands and chatted for just a few seconds.

Putin, an ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, has expressed skepticism that his government would have launched a reported Aug. 21 chemical attack on the Damascus suburbs.

White House officials said the two leaders had no plans for a meeting, underscoring the dashed hope that Putin’s role as host would bring about a warming in relations and a possible break in the U.S.-Russia impasse over the Syrian civil war.

Putin has been put out with Obama for canceling a one-on-one meeting in Moscow after Putin refused to extradite Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency contract employee who leaked details of U.S. surveillance programs.

Obama was making telephone calls to foreign leaders and will use the summit, ostensibly about economic issues, to press his case for a strike against Syria.

“We would not anticipate every member of the G20 agreeing about the way forward in Syria, particularly given the Russian position,” said Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, who talked to reporters on Air Force One during the flight to Russia from Sweden.

Obama will, however, “explain our current thinking” to allies and partners and explore what type of “political and diplomatic support they may express for our efforts to hold the Syrian regime accountable,” Rhodes said.

Obama’s first meeting at the summit was with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who thanked Obama for reaching out to him by telephone to discuss the situation in Syria.

Well-placed Israeli sources told Fox News they ""get it"" as to why the president felt the need to cloak his planned military strikes in congressional legitimacy. But they regard the way he went about his decision-making in this instance as erratic, unnerving to them, and a bad omen for what the Israelis regard as the sine qua non of their foreign policy: the looming showdown with Iran over its nuclear program.

""The feeling is that something was wrong here, that this was not the way this should have gone down, that this is not the way a superpower should act,"" said one former Israeli diplomat who has spent considerable time in the United States and enjoys close ties to the Netanyahu government. ""We look at Syria, and we think Iran. ... What conclusions should be drawn about how America will act in other circumstances? Here was a clear red line. It was breached a few times. This looks like a clever move; but America's willingness to 'walk the walk' now is very questionable.""

Another senior official, presently in the Israeli government, told Fox News the president was right, in terms of domestic U.S. politics, to ""look for cover,"" and thereby force American lawmakers who would have criticized him for undertaking unauthorized action to ""own it, too."" But this official said the Israelis, from their vantage point, see the Obama administration as detached from the Mideast and the president, in particular, as ill-equipped to shape events there.

""I can only compliment Obama for dragging everyone to his boat,"" the Israeli official said. ""'You want war? Own it, too.' Still, however, he's a disastrous weak leader. ... The Middle East is far less important for this administration and to real American national interests today than in the past. ... The U.S.-Saudi alliance insures a continued supply of oil, and other than that, the U.S. doesn't really care.""

When President Obama visited Israel in March, the first foreign trip of his second term, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked him for showing unprecedented support of Israel's position on Iran. ""I appreciate the fact that the president has reaffirmed -- more than any other president -- Israel's right and duty to defend itself, by itself, against any threat,"" Netanyahu said at the time.

Now, sources said, Netanyahu has instructed his cabinet ministers to refrain from public statements that will unduly affect the pending congressional vote in the United States. Only the prime minister himself and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon are said to be permitted to comment on the Syrian crisis. However, Israeli President Shimon Peres -- who enjoys unique stature as one of the last of the country's founders still active in public life, and whose office is largely ceremonial in nature -- spoke in praise of the president during a session with foreign ambassadors in Jerusalem on Tuesday.

""I express my admiration for the attempt of President Obama to check every possible angle how to bring an end to this horrible situation in Syria,"" Peres said, adding that the situation is viewed that way ""in the eyes of the Arabs, not only in our eyes. And I'm sure that none of us can overlook it.""

In urging Congress to approve his planned strikes, the president on Tuesday cited the security of the Jewish state, among that of other regional allies, as a factor for lawmakers to consider. ""There are certain weapons,"" Obama said, ""that when used can not only end up resulting in grotesque deaths, but also can end up being transmitted to non-state actors -- can pose a risk to allies and friends of ours, like Israel, like Jordan, like Turkey."""

Darrell Issa's criticisms of their work On Wednesday, White House released e-mails on administration response to attack

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama called on Congress Thursday to fully fund administration requests for additional diplomatic security measures in the wake of the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The requests include increasing the number of Marine guards dispatched to protect facilities around the world, Obama said.

“I am intent on making sure we do everything we can to prevent another tragedy like this from happening,” he told reporters Thursday at a joint news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Obama’s entreaty to Congress comes amid continuing sharp criticism by many Republicans of the administration’s response to the September 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others.

One of the sharpest critics, U.S. Rep Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has been engaged in a dispute with the co-chairmen of the Accountability Review Board over their report last year on the attack and the U.S. response to it.

Former U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering and retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen wrote to Issa to demand a public hearing to answer Issa’s criticisms, according to a letter obtained exclusively by CNN.

“The public deserves to hear your questions and our answers,” they wrote.

Pickering and Mullen chaired the Accountability Review Board convened in October by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to investigate the attack.

Their report found “systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies” at the State Department leading to the attack.

But it also found no evidence of a breach of duty by any U.S. officials related to the incident.

Many Republicans, however, argue that the administration failed to strengthen diplomatic security in Libya despite deteriorating conditions there, failed to adequately to respond to the attack once it was under way and then misled the public about what had happened.

Issa has called the board’s review “a failure” and has asked for further investigations into the Obama administration’s response during the attack and its aftermath.

The dispute between Issa and the co-chairmen came to a head after neither Pickering nor Mullen attended a May 8 House Oversight Committee hearing on the attacks, sparking a heated back and forth about who was invited and when.

The rhetoric intensified Sunday during a highly contentious joint appearance with Issa and Pickering on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in which Issa maintained that the two “refused to come before our committee.” Pickering insisted that he was not invited despite expressing a willingness to testify.

Issa also suggested on the program that Pickering and Mullen meet with the committee behind closed doors so as not to create “some sort of stage show.”

But the two asserted in their letter that a public hearing is a “more appropriate forum” and accuse Issa of changing his “position on the terms of our appearance.”

“Having taken liberal license to call into question the Board’s work, it is surprising that you now maintain that members of the committee need a closed-door proceeding before being able to ask ‘informed questions’ at a public hearing,” they write.

Pickering and Mullen assert that since they are not witnesses but rather officials asked to serve on a review board, they should be permitted to testify in public.

“While we understand and respect that your committee has the authority and responsibility to review the Benghazi attacks, we ask that you similarly understand and respect that the Accountability Review Board bore its own authority and responsibility to review Benghazi,” they write.

“What the Committee is now proposing is highly unusual in the context of senior officials who are not fact witnesses but instead are reporting their own independent review.”

They have suggested a hearing May 28 or June 3.

On Wednesday, the White House released more than 100 pages of e-mails detailing the complex conversations between the CIA, State Department and White House in developing unclassified talking points that were used to underpin the administration’s controversial and slow-to-evolve account of the attack.

That account initially focused on an explanation – later proved untrue – that the attack stemmed from a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States. There had been such a demonstration in Cairo.

The White House and its congressional allies say the initial confusion and conflicting information was a result of the “fog of war,” not a deliberate effort to mislead the public about the source of the attacks.

Senior Obama administration officials contend that the e-mails demonstrate the process of developing talking points for members of Congress to use in media interviews was not focused on politics but rather on events.

For instance, some of the e-mails expressed caution about what should be said publicly during an FBI investigation while others centered on the strength of intelligence at the time.

“Collectively, these e-mails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House’s interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Thursday."

Obama has staked the credibility of the United States — and his presidency — on his call for a military operation to punish the Syrian government for its alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians last month.

But the president faces hardening barriers in Congress, where both Republican critics and Democratic allies have voiced deep reservations or flat opposition to his proposal to intervene militarily in a predominantly Muslim nation after a decade of war overseas. Polls show that much of the American public is skeptical, too.

Obama carved out time from his trip abroad this week to call key U.S. lawmakers, including five calls to Democratic and Republican senators on Wednesday.

The urgency partly reflects the surprising way that Obama culminated days of deliberation over how to respond to President Bashar al-Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons, which Obama called “an assault on human dignity” that cannot go unpunished. He announced Saturday that he would seek congressional approval for any military strike against the Syrian government, and he has struggled to rally support across party lines amid his previously scheduled trip to Sweden and Russia.

View Graphic As of Sept. 4, lawmakers appear to be tentatively dividing into four camps over military action in Syria.

The White House lobbying effort has included direct conversations between Obama or top administration officials and at least 60 senators and at least 125 House members as of Thursday, according to a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration operations.

Late Thursday afternoon, Vice President Biden and Antony Blinken, the deputy national security adviser, briefed a bipartisan group of House and Senate members in the White House Situation Room, an administration official said.

The outcome of a congressional vote, especially in the Republican­led House, is unclear, and the issue has blurred traditional party lines.

White House officials said they are not concerned about the vote trend in Congress so far. They said Obama, who is to return to Washington late Friday, will begin a more public campaign, including perhaps a presidential address, to win support from Congress and the American public for a strike.

The full Senate plans to begin considering as early as Friday a resolution authorizing the use of force after a divided Foreign Relations Committee this week backed limited military action. Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) is “guardedly optimistic” that the resolution can pass, according to Senate aides.

But Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), a moderate Democrat who has been a bipartisan consensus-­builder, said Thursday that a military strike “would be the wrong course of action” before all diplomatic options are exhausted.

Here in St. Petersburg, Obama’s quandary over Syria — and his estrangement from the summit’s host and Syria’s key patron, Russian President Vladi­mir Putin — largely overshadowed the economic agenda of the Group of 20 meeting.

Obama used the gathering to privately press his G-20 colleagues to support a U.S.-led strike in words, if not resources. He found one possible ally in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who Obama said agrees that the Syrian attack should not go unpunished.

The White House detailed an extensive outreach to lawmakers that is being coordinated by aides in Washington, as well as by national security adviser Susan E. Rice and a key deputy, Benjamin J. Rhodes, who are traveling with Obama in Russia.

On Wednesday, Obama and senior White House officials made more than 25 phone calls to lawmakers from both parties. Chief of Staff Denis McDonough arranged calls with the Progressive Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus in the House, while Blinken held a conference call with Jewish House members.

The administration also has held classified briefings for any lawmaker who requests one detailing evidence that the alleged Aug. 21 chemical attack was carried out by Assad’s regime. The administration has said that more than 1,400 civilians, including at least 426 children, were killed when rockets containing highly toxic sarin gas were launched from regime territory and landed on rebel strongholds or contested areas in the Damascus suburbs.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have participated in the Capitol Hill outreach. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday that the United States must “respond decisively to this horrific attack” in Syria.

Obama spent most of the day Thursday in private meetings with world leaders but spoke briefly with reporters at the start of one session. Seated at a long table across from Abe, Obama spoke about their “joint recognition that the use of chemical weapons in Syria is not only a tragedy but also a violation of international law that must be addressed.”

The loudest critic of military action in Syria is Putin, who has scoffed at U.S. allegations about the attack. Putin welcomed Obama to the ornate Constantine Palace, once the summer playground for Russian czars, with a formal handshake and about 15 seconds of chitchat. The two leaders do not plan to meet here, although U.S. officials said Obama and Putin may interact informally on the summit’s sidelines.

Obama has argued forcefully that a U.S.-led military strike is needed to enforce an international ban on the use of chemical weapons and to degrade the ability of Assad’s forces to use them again in a brutal conflict with rebels that is in its third year.

The State Department said Thursday that Kerry, who has been the administration’s most visible supporter of military action in Syria, will travel to Europe over the weekend for consultations with allies and partners. He is scheduled first to speak with European Union counterparts who are meeting in Lithuania. In Paris, Kerry will meet with senior French officials and with Arab League representatives.

In Washington, many lawmakers said they remain unconvinced that the United States should engage militarily in Syria, even after closed-door classified briefings led by national security officials.

“I’ve had more phone calls on this issue than on any issue I’ve ever had since I got here in 2001, and my phone calls, e-mails, faxes are running 96 percent no,” said Rep. John Abney Culberson (R-Tex.). He said that there’s “absolutely no question” that Assad attacked innocent civilians but that “America has absolutely no strategic interest involved, and we should stay out of it.”

A growing number of liberals also oppose military action, including key allies of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who backs a strike. Rep. Niki Tsongas (D-Mass.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said, “I give the administration great credit for strongly making their case, but I still have many reservations about the unintended consequences of our actions.”

With a vote in the House several days away at least, aides said Pelosi has not started reaching out to individual lawmakers because she believes that colleagues need time to review hundreds of classified documents and other materials.

To help rally support for the authorization, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is asking the CIA to prepare DVDs for members of Congress containing video footage that supports the administration’s claims about the alleged chemical attack.

Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said Thursday that the video evidence will help inform lawmakers’ decisions.

Assad’s forces have used chemical weapons “between 11 and 14 times before” the Aug. 21 attack “but in small amounts,” Feinstein said. “And I looked at that as if they were testing it in some way. It is a very serious situation, and Assad’s got to understand there is a penalty for this.”

When President Barack Obama recently addressed the United Nations General Assembly this week, the speech ran to more than 5,000 words, most of them focused on turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa. Yet the president never mentioned the continuing genocide conducted in several parts of Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir.



There was a time when Mr. Obama expressed outrage over the mass murder and aerial bombardment of civilians in the Darfur region of western Sudan. In 2007, the then-presidential hopeful said the Western world's silence regarding the slaughter in Sudan would leave ""a stain on our souls.""



Now President Obama has joined that silence. These days, to learn about what is transpiring in Sudan, one must turn to Radio Dabanga, broadcasting from Denmark. A recent report described the bombardment of a Darfur village called Abu Tega, which was ""completely burned and the population fled in all directions.""



President Obama's critics have denounced his foreign-policy choices, which they believe have weakened the global credibility of the U.S. But Mr. Obama has managed to avoid scrutiny about his most tragic foreign failure: standing by as Sudan's Islamic regime perpetrates a slaughter against its own citizens who belong to non-Arab ethnic groups. Bashir continues a 10-year annihilation, slaughtering many tens of thousands, and very likely more.



Previous American presidents have betrayed a similar callous disregard for the taking of human life. Most notably Bill Clinton, who did nothing to stop genocidal assaults in Rwanda, where the Hutus slaughtered 800,000 Tutsis in 1994. Mr. Clinton has come to see this inaction as his most historic dereliction of duty. He has since admitted that the international community was complicit in mass murder abroad when the U.S. could have acted to save a few hundred thousand lives.



""We did not act quickly enough after the killing began,"" Mr. Clinton said on a reconciliation tour in Rwanda in 1998. ""We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. ... We owe to all the people in the world our best efforts to organize ourselves so that we can maximize the chances of preventing these events.""



Mr. Clinton's regrets offer a cautionary tale. President Obama and his current National Security Adviser Susan Rice would agree -- or at least they did when in 2007, they separately condemned the Bush administration for its inaction in Sudan, specifically citing the Clinton administration's failure in Rwanda. Both proclaimed that the U.S. should never again fail to intervene when innocents are being slaughtered.



Mr. Obama has cited humanitarian reasons to intervene in a crisis when politically convenient. He entered Libya ""to prevent a bloodbath,"" despite no mass slaughter of civilians in the country. This disingenuous explanation only damaged his credibility as a humanitarian, though it did placate the international human-rights community.



So why does Sudan not deserve the same consideration? An enormous number of civilian lives are at stake in Darfur. Bashir's assaults against the people of Sudan have escalated in intensity. Some three million people are living -- if you can even call it that -- in refugee camps with wretched conditions. They lack even food, water, sanitation and basic medical attention. Hundreds of thousands of children are growing up malnourished with stunted growth and damaged cognitive abilities. If they survive, they are left without an education to a lifetime of suffering, with many likely eventually succumbing to disease.



And the camps are hardly safe. Bashir's henchmen continue to attack them, and torch villages and fields, indiscriminately murder roughly 10,000 people per month. Still more Darfuris continue to die from disease and other causes at alarming rates, with the dead no longer even counted. The world is unaware of the carnage because the region is closed to the international community and media. Even many key U.N. and humanitarian personnel have been expelled recently.



There is a moral imperative to help the people of Darfur, which President Obama once articulated well. In 2007 he said, ""Today we know what is right, and today we know what is wrong. The slaughter of innocents is wrong. Two million people driven from their homes is wrong. Women gang raped while gathering firewood is wrong. And silence, acquiescence and paralysis in the face of genocide is wrong."" He made his solution clear: ""We've got to have a protective force on the ground.""



Yet those suffering in Darfur can expect no such ""protective force."" For reasons that are unclear, Sudan doesn't meet Mr. Obama's threshold for action. His words at the U.N., including generic rhetoric ""that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and North Africa that is peaceful and prosperous,"" offer little hope if any. Mr. Obama has abandoned his own moral standards and left the people of Darfur to perish.

Although no one is suggesting that the groups pose an imminent threat to the United States, the French military intervention in Mali and a terrorist attack against an international gas complex in neighboring Algeria have prompted sharp Obama administration debate over whether the militants present enough of a risk to U.S. allies or interests to warrant a military response.

Some top Pentagon officials and military officers warn that without more aggressive U.S. action, Mali could become a haven for extremists, akin to Afghanistan before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

Militants in Mali, “if left unaddressed, ... will obtain capability to match their intent — that being to extend their reach and control and to attack American interests,” Army Gen. Carter Ham, head of the U.S. Africa Command, said in an interview.

But many of Obama’s top aides say it is unclear whether the Mali insurgents, who include members of the group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, threaten the U.S.

Those aides also worry about being drawn into a messy and possibly long-running conflict against an elusive enemy in Mali, a vast landlocked country abutting the Sahara desert, just as U.S. forces are withdrawing from Afghanistan.

“No one here is questioning the threat that AQIM poses regionally,” said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing internal deliberations. “The question we all need to ask is, what threat do they pose to the U.S. homeland? The answer so far has been none.”

Another U.S. official, who is regularly briefed on such intelligence, said the groups’ goals were often hard to distinguish.

“AQIM and its allies have opportunistic criminals and smugglers in their midst, but they also have some die-hard terrorists with more grandiose visions,” the official said. “In some cases, the roles may overlap.”

The internal debate is one reason for a delay in U.S. support for the French, who airlifted hundreds of troops into Mali last weekend and launched airstrikes in an effort to halt the militants from pushing out of their northern stronghold toward Bamako, the Malian capital.

The Pentagon is planning to begin ferrying additional French troops and equipment to Mali in coming days aboard U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo jets, according to Air Force Maj. Robert Firman, a Pentagon spokesman.

Military planners are still studying the airport runways in Bamako to determine whether they can handle the huge C-17s. If not, they will land elsewhere and the French troops will be flown into Mali on smaller aircraft. French officials have asked the U.S. to transport an armored infantry battalion of 500 to 600 soldiers, plus vehicles and other equipment.

The U.S. is also providing France with surveillance and other intelligence on the militants.

But the administration has so far balked at a French request for tanker aircraft to provide in-air refueling of French fighter jets because the White House does not yet want to get directly involved in supporting French combat operations, officials said.

U.S. officials have ruled out putting troops on the ground, except in small numbers and only to support the French.

“I think the U.S. ambivalence about moving into Mali is very understandable,” said Richard Barrett, a former British diplomat who serves as United Nations counter-terrorism coordinator. Noting the instances where U.S. forces have been drawn into conflict with Islamic militants, he said, “Why would they want another one, for God’s sake? It’s such a difficult area to operate in.”

After 2001, Washington tried to tamp down Islamic extremism in Mali under a counter-terrorism initiative that combined anti-poverty programs with training for the military. The U.S. aid was halted, however, when military officers overthrew the government last March in a violent coup.

Gen. Ham has warned for months that AQIM was growing stronger and intended to carry out attacks in the region and elsewhere. To combat the threat, some officers favor building closer ties with governments in the region and boosting intelligence-gathering and special operations.

But other administration officials question the need for a bigger U.S. effort.

Johnnie Carson, who heads the Africa bureau at the State Department, told Congress in June that AQIM “has not demonstrated the capability to threaten U.S. interests outside of West or North Africa, and it has not threatened to attack the U.S. homeland.”

Advertisement

The September attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, has provided fodder for both sides: AQIM members participated, U.S. intelligence officials have said, but the U.S. has found no evidence the attack was ordered or planned by AQIM.

A rebellion last year by ethnic Tuareg in northern Mali paved the way for AQIM and allied groups, including the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa, known by its French acronym MUJAO, to seize Mali’s northern half.

Advertisement

U.S. officials say the Islamist groups have used the Texas-sized area to establish training camps, recruit fighters from African and European nations, including France, and strengthen ties with other African extremist groups.

A U.S. intelligence official said the militant groups’ “limited people and expertise” require them to focus most of their effort on holding the territory they’ve seized. But over time, the official said, the groups’ growth could threaten other nations in the region.

Advertisement

“They have to train these guys, provide these guys with skills,” the official said, referring to foreign recruits. “At some point down the road, they will probably go back home, and that increases the threat in those home countries.”

The militant groups “all appear to me to be essentially criminal networks based on kidnapping and smuggling … having little to do with Islam or with the remnants of Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” said John Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria now at the Council on Foreign Relations.

French officials have depicted their intervention as a stop-gap move until an African military force of 3,300 is ready to train the Malian army and help it recapture territory from the rebels. The United Nations endorsed the mission in December, and the first soldiers arrived in Mali this week, but African officials have said it could take several months or the forces to begin operations.

He spends much of his time fending off attacks from political opponents who accuse him of having already sold out the country’s rights when he was the nuclear negotiator by temporarily suspending uranium enrichment while under heavy international pressure in 2004.

Hoping to force Iran to stop enriching uranium and begin negotiating in earnest, the Obama administration has imposed tough economic sanctions that appear to be wreaking havoc on Iran’s economy. But if the presidential campaign is any indication, rather than forcing a capitulation, the sanctions seem only to have stiffened Iran’s will to resist.

“Year after year, America has imposed harsher sanctions on us,” said Nader Karimi Joni, an Iranian journalist who is critical of certain state polices. “Now, with these candidates, we see the consequences: the sanctions hurt, but they have made our leaders much more determined.”

The stances of Mr. Jalili, the current nuclear negotiator, and Mr. Rowhani, the former negotiator, illustrate how much Iran’s position has hardened after a decade of escalating sanctions and increasing international isolation.

Mr. Jalili, in particular, has turned the election into a referendum on the country’s nuclear stance, banking on the support of Iran’s governing establishment, a mix of conservative clerics and Islamic Revolutionary Guards commanders for whom anti-Western sentiment is a staple."

Pollak'],"In Foreign Affairs, Obama's 'Not Bush' Non-Policy Collapses","The alleged use of deadly chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians and opponents on the anniversary of President Barack Obama’s “red line” statement might have marked the collapse of Obama’s foreign policy–if such policy actually existed. In fact, however, the Obama administration has no foreign policy other than its continued opposition to the perceived postures of George W. Bush, more than four years gone.

Obama’s policy in Syria had been to rehabilitate the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Well before he won the presidency, Democrats–including current Secretary of State John Kerry–made a point of visiting Assad to show their approach to foreign relations was different from, and more effective than, the allegedly confrontational approach of the Bush administration. Syria’s nuclear weapons program, exposed when Israel destroyed it in 2007, did not prompt any change in Democrats’ approach to the regime.

Therefore Obama renewed diplomatic relations and re-opened the U.S. embassy in Damascus, elevating the status of the regime. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even referred to Assad as a “reformer.” The hope was that doing so would convince him to side with the U.S. over Iran, and to win goodwill in the Arab world more generally.

In Egypt, the Obama administration adopted a similar approach, i.e. appeasing a tyrant with the intention of establishing a clear break with Bush’s pressure for democratic reforms and encourage a new perception of the U.S. as more open to the Arab and Muslim worlds. In the midst of an orgy of federal spending, Obama cut funding for pro-democracy groups in Egypt and prioritized relations with Hosni Mubarak’s regime.

At the same time, however, Obama began trying to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood, not because he wished to encourage a democratic process in Egypt that might include their participation, but because he wished to appease Islamist sentiment in general. His administration refused, for example, to identify radical Islam as the source of terrorism, and even redefined the term “war on terror” itself as “overseas contingency operations.”

Therefore when the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, the Obama administration initially tried to argue that he was not a “dictator.” Then, as media criticism began to mount, Obama switched sides and backed Mubarak’s ouster, all the while claiming that he had not, in fact, changed his policy. His previous efforts to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood as a legitimate organization gave some amount–though not much–of legitimacy to that claim.

Today, in the aftermath of the Egyptian coup, Obama’s foreign policy has lost even the pretense of principle. He is showing outrage at the Egyptian military’s treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood protestors, cutting some aid and canceling joint military exercises (none of which he did in response to the Brotherhood’s own excesses when in power). Yet he refuses to call the coup itself a “coup,” or to cut all aid to the Egyptian military.

Meanwhile, in Syria, Obama is still refusing to do anything that might actually deter the regime from using banned weapons–such as imposing a no-fly zone, for instance–while accelerating aid to the Syrian rebels, who are dominated by anti-American jihadists. His policies are all half-measures and contradictions. Faced with the fact that his academic anti-colonialism has little real-world relevance, he is just avoiding any real commitments.

In fact, the only real foreign policy priority of the Obama administration is to avoid being blamed for anything that could possibly go wrong. He concluded his remarks on Egypt last week by insisting: “We don’t take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it’s tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what’s gone wrong.” The buck stops…with Egypt, he said. Not with me.

That is not to say that the Middle East’s current problems are easy to resolve. Republicans and conservatives have had a tough time coming to a consensus about what should be done. The Arab world presents only bad options and worse options: a genocidal regime in Syria versus brutal jihadist groups; a military tyranny in Egypt versus radical Islamists with hegemonic ambitions. The dangerous temptation to withdraw is strong.

The one point of agreement among conservatives–even the likes of Patrick Buchanan, these days–is that the U.S. should primarily be concerned with shoring up Israel against common enemies such as Al Qaeda and Iran. In other words, the best path might be to focus on the sole U.S. ally in the region. But the Obama administration has done the opposite, pressuring Israel and giving Iran leeway, despite continued frustration.

It is arguable that the Bush administration had a similarly rudderless foreign policy when it took office in 2001, driven only by the desire to do the opposite of its predecessor. Yet it pulled together a new strategy–however flawed–after 9/11, when circumstances had changed. Obama has failed to learn from crisis–whether the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009, or the Arab Spring and its aftermath. “Not Bush” is a non-policy, but a real failure."

Death count for Syrian civil war has passed 100%2C000

U.S.%2C Russia and U.N. working to convene conference to establish transitional government

Uprising against President Bashar Assad%27s rule began in March 2011

DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — The number of dead in Syria's civil war has passed 100,000, the U.N. chief said Thursday, calling for urgent talks on ending 2½ years of violence even as President Bashar Assad's government blasted the United States as an unsuitable peace broker.

In the latest example of the relentless carnage, a car bomb killed at least 10 people and wounded 66 in a pro-regime, residential area near the capital.

All international attempts to broker a political solution to the Syrian civil war have failed. Despite a stalemate that has settled in for months, both sides still believe they can win the war and have placed impossible conditions for negotiations.

The international community has been unable — and some say, unwilling — to intervene sufficiently to tip the balance in favor of either the Assad regime or the rebels.

""There is no military solution to Syria,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters at the United Nations. ""There is only a political solution, and that will require leadership in order to bring people to the table,"" he said.

He spoke ahead of talks with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said the death toll had risen from nearly 93,000 just over a month ago to more than 100,000. Syrian opposition groups had made that same estimate a month ago.

The uprising against Assad's rule began in March 2011 and deteriorated into an insurgency with growing sectarian overtones.

Ban called on the Syrian government and opposition to halt the violence, saying it is ""imperative to have a peace conference in Geneva as soon as possible.""

The U.S. and Russia are working to convene a conference, along with the United Nations, to try to agree on a transitional government based on a plan adopted in Geneva a year ago.

No official date has been set because the opposition refuses to attend any talks that are not about Assad's departure. Syrian government officials say participation in the conference should be without preconditions, but add that Assad's departure before his term expires in 2014 is not negotiable. Assad has also said he has the right to run for elections again.

Kerry said he talked to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday and that both countries remained committed to bringing the warring parties together to further peace efforts.

""We will try our hardest to make that happen as soon as is possible,"" Kerry said.

The comments at the U.N. appeared at odds with what was happening inside Syria. A U.S. decision to start sending arms to the rebels has further dimmed peace prospects.

The Syrian government criticized the U.S. actions, saying Washington is unsuitable to act as a broker at any peace negotiations.

""Washington's decision to send arms to terrorists in Syria confirms that the American administration is not objective in efforts to find a political solution and hold an international conference in Geneva,"" Syrian state TV said, citing an unidentified Foreign Ministry official. Assad's government routinely refers to opposition fighters as ""terrorists.""

""The American intentions seek to continue the cycle of violence and terrorism in Syria in order to destabilize ... the region,"" the statement said.

The U.S. government opposed providing any lethal assistance to Syria's rebels until last month but is moving ahead now with sending weapons to vetted rebels after securing the approval of the House and Senate Intelligence committees.

President Barack Obama and his national security team have yet to say publicly what weapons they'll provide and when they'll deliver them. There has also been concern in the West that U.S. weapons could end up in the hands of al-Qaida-linked groups.

The Syrian National Coalition, the main Western-backed opposition group, said in a statement that it was committed to ensuring the arms reach only those loyal to the coalition and its affiliated military councils.

The Syrian government has gone on the offensive and has succeeded, with the help of Lebanese Hezbollah militants, in pushing back rebels near Damascus and in central Homs province.

The White House acknowledged that momentum has shifted as Hezbollah and Iran have helped Assad's forces.

The rebels are lashing out with stepped up mortar attacks on Damascus, the seat of Assad's power, and with car bombs that target regime strongholds and security installations.

Thursday's car bomb exploded in Jaramana, a suburb just few kilometers (miles) southeast of Damascus that is overwhelmingly pro-regime.

The state news agency SANA reported that the blast caused heavy damage to nearby buildings and destroyed many cars. TV footage showed mangled cars and heavily damaged residential buildings. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights initially put the death toll at 10 but later raised it to 17, saying several of the wounded had died.

Also Thursday, the Syrian National Coalition cast doubt on a mission by U.N. experts to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons in the civil war.

Both sides accuse each other of using the banned weapons. Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom and U.N. disarmament chief Angela Kane met with Syrian officials Tuesday in Damascus to try to hammer out terms for a possible probe.

The coalition said it was worried the experts would be swayed by Assad, whom they predicted would try to restrict their movements.

Ban said the U.N. team discussed with Syrian officials ""the modalities of investigation.""

""Since they're coming out of Syria now, we'll get the report soon,"" he said.

In Lebanon, a senior Hezbollah official warned European countries that there will be ""repercussions"" to their decision this week to place the group's military wing on the bloc's list of terrorist organizations.

Hezbollah's participation in the Syrian war alongside Assad's forces was among the reasons for the EU decision earlier this week.

Ammar al-Moussawi, head of Hezbollah's foreign relations department, spoke after meeting with Angelina Eichhorst, the EU ambassador to Lebanon. He suggested after the talks that she was not given a warm reception.

""No one can condemn me with one hand, then extend the other to shake hands,"" he told reporters in Beirut after the meeting.

At a news conference last week, Mr. Obama argued that the United States should “get out of the habit” of having the president “stretch the boundaries of his authority as far as he can” while lawmakers “snipe” from the sidelines. But he also explained his decision in terms of very special circumstances: humanitarian interventions where there is no immediate pressure to act and the United Nations is blocked.

Jack Goldsmith, a head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration, said the limited criteria cited by Mr. Obama mean his move might not apply to more traditional future interventions. The more important precedent, he said, may concern international law and what he portrayed as Mr. Obama’s dismissive attitude toward whether or not having permission from the Security Council should stop humanitarian interventions.

Mr. Obama has in recent days repeatedly portrayed the Security Council system as incapable of performing its function of “enforcing international norms and international law,” and as so paralyzed by the veto power wielded by Russia that it is instead acting as a “barrier” to that goal.

Mr. Goldsmith said that in the Kosovo campaign, the Clinton administration shied away from arguing that it was consistent with international law to carry out a military attack not authorized by the Security Council purely for humanitarian reasons. Its fear was that such a doctrine could be misused by other nations, loosening constraints on war.

In his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, Mr. Obama said all nations “must adhere to standards that govern the use of force.” But he also argued that humanitarian grounds justified military force and cited “the Balkans,” leaving ambiguous whether he meant Bosnia, which had some Security Council approval; Kosovo, which did not; or both.

Ms. Ruemmler said that while an attack on Syria “may not fit under a traditionally recognized legal basis under international law,” the administration believed that given the novel factors and circumstances, such an action would nevertheless be “justified and legitimate under international law” and so not prohibited."

http://news.yahoo.com/iranians-scent-brighter-future-nuclear-deal-165127485--business.html,,[],Iranians scent brighter future after nuclear deal,"By Marcus George and Isabel Coles DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranians welcomed a nuclear deal between their leaders and six world powers on Sunday, hopeful the easing of certain sanctions would go some way to ending their deep economic pain. The cost of basic goods in the oil-producing country has soared, investment has plummeted and unemployment has risen under the international sanctions imposed by United Nations and the unilateral measures of the United States and the European Union. A weak currency, the rial, has made matters worse. The deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for limited sanctions relief will not allow any more Iranian oil into the market or let in Western energy investors. But it may allow Iran access to $1.5 billion in revenue from trade in gold and precious metals, suspend some sanctions on its automotive sector, and allow petrochemical exports to revive. The rial, decimated earlier this year due to sanctions, jumped more than 3 percent against the U.S. dollar on Sunday. ""I just heard the news now. It's great, it's really great. Many of the problems we have in Iran are due to sanctions. Now we can have hope again. We're really excited,"" said freelance graphic designer Ali, aged 29, who lives in Tehran. The rial is expected to strengthen further. In October 2012, the currency lost more than 50 percent of its value in a matter of days, forcing businesses to halt trading because exchange rates were so volatile and sending the economy into a tailspin that brought angry traders onto the streets. ""For the last few years, these politics have directly affected our economy,"" said Ali. ""So far there has not been a lot of change, but this is just the beginning."" ""Everyone's happy about this news,"" said an Iranian businessman in the IT sector in Tehran who imports computer equipment into Iran. ""I heard about it first thing this morning when I got up. People are discussing it a lot. ""I'm optimistic,"" he said. ""I hope it's going to be good news for the dollar rate and that business will pick up. If the rial gets stronger, we get stronger."" HOPE AND PRIDE Iran's rulers portrayed the agreement as a triumph for Iranian diplomacy and moderate President Hassan Rouhani's policy of ""constructive engagement"" with the world. His election has ushered in calm and now Iranians hope the breakthrough on the nuclear issue will give him the means to put into practice his vision of getting the Islamic Republic back on its feet. ""Rouhani's able to bring stability to the currency. It's shown he can do it and he's done it. We'll definitely see progress,"" said the businessman who declined to be named. ""I am optimistic about the future as long as the administration of the country is in the hands of experts and people with experience,"" said Parastu, 22-year-old student in Tehran. A post in Farsi by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Facebook page announcing a deal had been struck received over 100,000 comments in a matter of hours. Some hailed the U.S.-educated career diplomat as a ""national hero"". ""Dear Doctor Zarif... Your efforts have filled the hearts of the whole nation with happiness. Be sure that your unparalleled efforts will not be forgotten by any Iranian,"" wrote one. ""I am writing this comment with my eyes filled with tears. Thank you for everything,"" said another. ""You have restored hope in our hearts and pride in my country."" POLITICAL PRISONERS Some were more cautious and questioned whether the agreement would have any practical impact on their lives. ""What difference will it make?"" asked Amir MH Dudehaki on Zarif's Facebook page. ""Will it reduce traffic? Will it improve the quality of petrol? Will it make the air clean? Will it make bread cheap? Will it reduce the rent on a house?"" There are few households costs that have not gone up in Iran in the last two years, the side-effects of a combination of sanctions and what many allege is economic mismanagement under hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who left office in August after two terms. He launched a reform plan in 2010 to wean Iran off generous subsidies that pushed up the cost of basic goods several fold. While his plan was lauded by the International Monetary Fund, critics lambasted its timing and implementation. Others directed their thoughts at domestic political issues, demanding the release of political prisoners and easing security controls against the population. ""We are still harassed by the Basij militia on city streets. They still hold up checkpoints in Tehran's posh districts to search cars for alcohol or harass unmarried couples for bribes or other purposes,"" said a 30-year-old dissident journalist in Tehran. The election of Hassan Rouhani has healed some of the wounds inflicted by the disputed re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 that brought millions of opposition supporters onto the streets in protest. Within two years, opposition leaders, Mirhossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi were confined under house arrest, an ordeal that continues until this day. Despite some signs of improvement the situation is deeply complex and could drag on for some time. ""This is a sweet agreement, a domestic agreement should also take shape,"" said one Twitter post. ""Political prisoners should be free."" (Writing by Jon Hemming; editing by Anna Willard)"

http://news.yahoo.com/kerry-warns-iraq-iran-flights-syria-132200384--politics.html,,[],Kerry warns Iraq on Iran flights to Syria,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Just days after the 10th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry confronted Baghdad for continuing to grant Iran access to its airspace and said Iraq's behavior was raising questions about its reliability as a partner.

Speaking to reporters during a previously unannounced trip to Baghdad, Kerry said that he and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had engaged in ""a very spirited discussion"" on the Iranian flights, which U.S. officials believe are ferrying weapons and fighters intended for the embattled Syrian government.

Kerry said the plane shipments — along with material being trucked across Iraqi territory from Iran to Syria — were helping President Bashar Assad's regime cling to power by increasing their ability to strike at Syrian rebels and opposition figures demanding Assad's ouster.

""I made it very clear that for those of us who are engaged in an effort to see President Assad step down and to see a democratic process take hold ... anything that supports President Assad is problematic,"" Kerry said at a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after meeting separately with Maliki at his office. ""And I made it very clear to the Prime Minister that the overflights from Iran are, in fact, helping to sustain President Assad and his regime.""

The overflights in Iraq have long been a source of contention between the U.S. and Iraq. Iraq and Iran claim the flights are carrying humanitarian goods, but American officials say they are confident that the planes are being used to arm the support the Assad regime. The administration is warning Iraq that unless action is taken, Iraq will be excluded from the international discussion about Syria's political future.

U.S. officials say that in the absence of a complete ban on flights, Washington would at least like the planes to land and be inspected in Iraq to ensure that they are carrying humanitarian supplies. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton secured a pledge from Iraq to inspect the flights last year, but since then only two aircraft have been checked by Iraqi authorities, according to U.S. officials.

Story continues

One senior U.S. official traveling with Kerry said the sheer number of overflights, which occur ""close to daily,"" along with shipments trucked to Syria from Iran through Iraq, was inconsistent with claims they are only carrying humanitarian supplies. The official said it was in Iraq's interest to prevent the situation in Syria from deteriorating further, particularly as there are fears that al-Qaida-linked extremists may gain a foothold in the country as the Assad regime falters.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said there are clear links between al-Qaida linked extremists operating in Syria and militants who are also carrying out terrorist attacks in Iraqi territory with increasing regularity.

Kerry's comments in Baghdad come as U.S. lawmakers are calling for President Barack Obama to do more to stop the bloodshed in Syria, including possible airstrikes against Assad's aircraft fleet.

The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, said Sunday the U.S. should create a ""safe zone"" in northern Syria that would give the U.S. more leverage with opposition forces.

""This doesn't mean the 101st Airborne Division and ships"" are deployed, Rogers told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ''It means small groups with special capabilities reengaging the opposition so we can vet them, train them, equip them so they can be an effective fighting force.""

Last week, Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., asked Obama in a letter to step up U.S. military efforts in the region, including destroying Assad's aircraft using precision airstrikes.

Kerry said Iraq's tacit approval of Iranian overflights left the American people wondering how an ally would undermine U.S. efforts, particularly after the enormous sacrifices made by the United States in liberating Iraq from Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule.

""There are members of Congress and people in America who increasingly are watching what Iraq is doing and wondering how it is that a partner in the efforts for democracy and a partner for whom Americans feel they have tried so hard to be helpful, how that country can be, in fact, doing something that makes it more difficult to achieve our common goals, the goal expressed by the prime minister with respect to Syria and President Assad,"" he said.

In addition to the overflights, Kerry said he had urged Maliki and other Iraqi officials to promote unity amid a spike in sectarian violence and called on them to ensure that upcoming provincial elections are free and fair. Kerry said the postponement of the polls in two provinces — Anbar and Ninevah — was unacceptable and should be reversed.

""We strongly urge the prime minister to take this issue to the cabinet and to see if it can be revisited, because we believe very strongly that everybody needs to vote simultaneously,"" he said.

In addition to his meeting with Maliki, Kerry saw Iraqi parliament speaker parliament speaker Osama al-Nujaifi, a Sunni, whose faction is at odds with Maliki's Shiia. Kerry also spoke by phone with Massoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdish Regional Government based in Irbil to encourage the Kurds not go ahead with unilateral actions — especially involving oil, like a pipeline deal with Turkey.

Kerry arrived in Baghdad from Amman, where he had been accompanying President Barack Obama on his tour of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan. His visit to Iraq is the first by a U.S. secretary of state since Clinton went in April 2009. During Obama's first term, the Iraq portfolio was largely delegated to Vice President Joe Biden as Obama wound down the war."

The American embassy in Baghdad was a likely target, according to unnamed U.S. officials quoted by the newspaper. The Journal said the officials did not describe the range of potential targets indicated by the intelligence.

In addition, the State Department issued a warning on Thursday telling U.S. citizens to avoid all but ""essential"" travel to Iraq.

President Barack Obama has asked the U.S. Congress to back his plan for limited strikes in response to a chemical weapons attack on civilians that the United States blames on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

The Journal reported that the Iranian message was intercepted in recent days and came from the head of the Revolutionary Guards' Qods Force. The newspaper said the message went to Iranian-supported Shi'ite militia groups in Iraq.

The Journal reported that the message informed Shi'ite groups to be prepared to respond with force after any U.S. military strike on Syria.

""Travel within Iraq remains dangerous given the security situation,"" according to the State Department's warning, which replaced an earlier one ""to update information on security incidents and to remind U.S. citizens of ongoing security concerns in Iraq, including kidnapping and terrorist violence.""

The department said that numerous insurgent groups, including al Qaeda's Iraq affiliate, remain active and ""terrorist activity and sectarian violence persist in many areas of the country at levels unseen since 2008.""

It added: ""The ability of the embassy to respond to situations in which U.S. citizens face difficulty, including arrests, is extremely limited.""

The State Department declined immediate comment. The CIA declined comment.

USA TODAY

China and Russia push back on U.S. criticism

Putin says Snowden is in a transit area - not technically in Russia

Edward Snowden%27s U.S. passport has been revoked

MOSCOW — The United States appeared no closer Tuesday to getting back fugitive Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who remains in Russia while trying to win third-country political asylum and protection from a U.S. extradition request on espionage charges.

Snowden, indicted for leaking classified National Security Agency information, remains in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport after fleeing Hong Kong on Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Snowden would not be handed over to the U.S. because the countries have no formal extradition treaty. Because Snowden is in a transit zone, he's not technically in Russia, Putin said.

While working for government security contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, Snowden, 30, exposed the NSA's massive, long-running Internet and telephone surveillance programs.



Russia and China — the latter of which also was unsympathetic to U.S. efforts to return Snowden after he fled from Hawaii to Hong Kong — have drawn sharp criticism from the Obama administration, further straining international relations.

China previously said it was concerned over Snowden's allegations that the U.S. had hacked into many of the country's Internet networks.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said despite the lack of an extradition treaty, there is ""clear legal basis to expel Mr. Snowden, based on the status of his travel documents and the pending charges against him.""



But Putin, while visiting Finland on Tuesday, said he would rather not intervene in the case and noted that trying to navigate a diplomatic resolution was problematic.

""I'd prefer not to deal with this issue at all. It's like shearing a pig — too much squeaking, too little wool,'' Putin said. The Russian president said Snowden was free to leave Russia. ""The sooner he chooses his final destination, the better it will be for us and him,"" Putin said.

Separately, a Chinese state newspaper praised Snowden for his decision to make public government surveillance programs, adding fresh pressure to increasingly strained U.S.-China relations. In a commentary, China's People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, lauded Snowden for ""tearing off Washington's sanctimonious mask.""

""In a sense, the U.S. has gone from a model of human rights to an eavesdropper on personal privacy, the manipulator of the centralized power over the international Internet, and the mad invader of other countries' networks,"" the People's Daily commentary said.

WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization that is financing Snowden's international travel and search for asylum, maintained Tuesday that Snowden had not been debriefed by either Chinese or Russian intelligence authorities.

""That is still the case, as far as I know,"" WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said, adding that Russian officials have ""made no request'' to interview Snowden about his knowledge of secret U.S. surveillance programs.

Hrafnsson declined to discuss Snowden's next move, though he said he was ""fairly optimistic'' that Ecuador would grant Snowden's asylum request.

http://news.yahoo.com/look-north-koreas-military-capabilities-083923209.html,,[],A look at North Korea's military capabilities,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea's military, founded 81 years ago Thursday, is older than the country itself. It began as an anti-Japanese militia and is now the heart of the nation's ""military first"" policy.

Late leader Kim Jong Il elevated the military's role during his 17-year rule; South Korea estimates he boosted troop levels to 1.2 million soldiers. The military's new supreme commander, Kim Jong Un, gave the Korean People's Army a sharpened focus this year by instructing troops to build a ""nuclear arms force."" Yet the army is believed to be running on outdated equipment and short supplies.

The secretive army divulges few details about its operations, but here is an assessment from foreign experts of its strengths and weaknesses:

___

ARTILLERY

North Korea provided a chilling reminder of what its artillery is capable of when it showered a front-line South Korean island with shells, killing four people in November 2010 and underscoring the threat that its artillery troops pose at the disputed sea border.

South Korea says North Korea has more than 13,000 artillery guns, and its long-range batteries are capable of hitting the capital Seoul, a city of more than 10 million people just 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the border.

""North Korea's greatest advantage is that its artillery could initially deliver a heavy bombardment on the South Korean capital,"" Mark Fitzpatrick, a former U.S. State Department official now with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an email.

South Korea's defense minister estimates that 70 percent of North Korean artillery batteries along the border could be ""neutralized"" in five days if war broke out. But Sohn Yong-woo, a professor at the Graduate School of National Defense Strategy of Hannam University in South Korea, said that would be too late to prevent millions of civilian casualties and avert a disastrous blow to Asia's fourth-largest economy.

___

SPECIAL FORCES

Experts believe guerrilla warfare would be the North's most viable strategy in the event of conflict, since its conventional army suffers from aging equipment and a shortage of firepower.

Story continues

Seoul estimates North Korea has about 200,000 special forces, and Pyongyang has used them before.

In 1968, 31 North Korean commandos stormed Seoul's presidential Blue House in a failed assassination attempt against then-President Park Chung-hee. That same year, more than 120 North Korean commandos sneaked into eastern South Korea and killed some 20 South Korean civilians, soldiers and police officers.

In 1996, 26 North Korean agents infiltrated South Korea's northeastern mountains after their submarine broke down, sparking a manhunt that left all but two of them dead, along with 13 South Korean soldiers and civilians.

""The special forces' goal is to discourage both the United States and South Korea from fighting with North Korea at the earliest stage of war by putting major infrastructure, such as nuclear plants, and their citizens at risk,"" said Kim Yeon-su, a professor at Korea National Defense University in Seoul. ""The North's special forces are a key component of its asymmetric capabilities along with nuclear bombs, missiles and artillery. Their job is to create as many battlefronts as possible to put their enemies in disarray.""

___

ON LAND, BY SEA AND IN THE AIR

In March 2010, 46 South Korean sailors died in a Yellow Sea attack on their warship that Seoul blamed on a North Korean submarine. Pyongyang denies involvement. Separately, since 1999, North and South Korean navies have fought three bloody skirmishes near their disputed western maritime border. Experts say those battles show while the South has an edge in naval firepower and technology, the North relies on the element of surprise.

North Korea has 70 submarines while South Korea has 10, according to Seoul's Defense Ministry. The most menacing threats from the North's navy are small submarines that would deposit commando raiders along the South Korean coast, said John Pike, head of the Globalsecurity.org think tank.

North Korea also has 820 warplanes, more than South Korea, though Seoul is backed up by American air power. The South says most of the North's aircraft are obsolete. North Korea also suffers chronic fuel shortages that have forced its air force to cut sorties, experts say.

""North Korea would not be able to prosecute a full-fledged war for very long,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""Its biggest problem is that North Korea would quickly lose control of the skies because of the vastly superior (South Korean) and U.S. air forces. The reported number of North Korean aircraft is meaningless, because many of them cannot fly, and North Korean pilots have little training in the air.""

The U.S. stations 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea and has recently flown nuclear-capable stealth B-2 bombers and F-22 fighter jets during joint drills in a show of force aimed at deterring North Korea.

Logistics and supplies are another issue. Heavy equipment deployed by naval and air forces requires extensive repairs, especially on rugged terrain like the Korean Peninsula. South Korea's Defense Ministry estimates North Korea's wartime resources, mostly stored underground, would last only two to three months.

""North Korea's only chance of winning any war depends on how quickly it can end one,"" Sohn said.

North Korea could try to compensate for its lack of effective equipment with sheer manpower. North Korea, a country of about 25 million, has an estimated 7.7 million reserves.

___

MISSILES AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS

North Korea says it needs to develop nuclear weapons as a deterrent against U.S. aggression. It has conducted three underground nuclear tests since 2006, the most recent in February.

Pyongyang is believed to have enough weaponized plutonium for four to eight nuclear bombs, according to Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear expert with Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation.

But he doubts Pyongyang has mastered the technology to tip a missile with a nuclear warhead. ""I don't believe North Korea has the capacity to attack the United States with nuclear weapons mounted on missiles and won't for many years,"" he said on the website of Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies this month.

Bruce Bennett, a Rand Corp. expert, said earlier this month that it's very unlikely the North has a nuclear missile capable of hitting the U.S. but said there is a ""reasonable chance"" that Pyongyang has short-range nuclear missile capability.

___

CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

North Korea denies it runs any chemical and biological weapons programs. South Korea claims that Pyongyang has up to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons.

The IISS says that although the figures are ""highly speculative,"" the North probably does possess chemical and biological arms programs.

""Whatever the actual status of North Korea's chemical and biological capabilities, the perception that it has, or likely has, chemical and biological weapons contributes to Pyongyang's interest in creating uncertainties in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo and raises the stakes to deter or intimidate potential enemies,"" it said on its website. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, but it has acceded to the non-binding Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.

Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

(CNN) —

Crucial talks on ending Syrian control of its chemical weapons began Thursday in Geneva with the top negotiators – U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov – offering similar goals but different ideas on how to reach them.

“This is not a game,” Kerry said, making clear that a U.S. threat to attack Syria for allegedly gassing its own people remained an option if the negotiations failed to prove Syria and its ally Russia were serious about the Syrian regime handing over its chemical weapons stockpiles.

Any agreement reached must be “comprehensive,” “verifiable,” “credible” and “able to be implemented in a timely fashion,” Kerry said, adding that “there ought to be consequences if it doesn’t take place.”

Lavrov, speaking in Russian, called for following established rules and protocols in the process for Syria to join the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and said that a solution “will make unnecessary” a military strike on Syria.

Also Thursday, Syrian U.N. Ambassdor Bashar Ja’afari said his country formally asked to join the chemical weapons convention that bans such arms.

However, the challenge facing negotiators was made clear by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who told Russian TV that his country would only agree to turn over its chemical weapons when the United States drops its threat to attack.

“This does not mean that Syria will sign these documents, carry out the conditions and that’s it,” al-Assad said, referring to the global convention against chemical weapons. “This bilateral process is based, first of all, on the United States stopping its policy of threatening Syria.”

In the interview, al-Assad said joining the convention gives Syria a standard 30 days to provide information on its stockpiles to the international community. Kerry appeared to reject that in his opening remarks for the talks with Lavrov.

Referring to al-Assad’s comment, Kerry said: “We believe there is nothing standard about this process” because of the August 21 chemical weapons attack in suburban Damascus that the United States estimates killed more than 1,400 people.

Reiterating the U.S. contention that al-Assad’s regime was responsible, Kerry said “we have in no uncertain terms made it clear that we cannot allow that to happen again.”

The planned two days of meetings in Geneva by full diplomatic teams, including weapons experts, were considered a litmus test by President Barack Obama’s administration for whether Russia is serious in pushing its ally Syria to give up hundreds of tons of chemical arms.

Otherwise, Obama argues for targeted military strikes intended to inhibit Syria’s ability to use its chemical weapons and deter it from considering doing so.

Key developments in Syria crisis

Skepticism that Russia plan may be stall tactic

Kerry first publicly broached the idea of Syria turning over control of its chemical weapons, responding to a journalist’s question Monday that such a move would prevent a U.S. attack.

In a move that appeared to catch the Obama administration by surprise, Russia then formally proposed putting the Syrian chemical arsenal under international control and al-Assad’s regime said it agreed.

The ongoing U.S.-Russia negotiations in Geneva aimed to work out details on taking control of Syria’s chemical weapons, setting the stage for a related U.N. Security Council resolution.

However, Russia’s steadfast opposition to any U.N. action on Syria raises questions about whether the talks in Geneva are merely a stall tactic to put off the U.S. attack Obama is threatening.

As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia has so far blocked U.N. action sought by the United States and European allies against al-Assad’s regime over chemical weapons.

That track record fuels questions in the United States about the sincerity of the new Russian proposal for Syria to turn over control of its chemical weapons, with concerns it is a stall tactic to put off a U.S. attack or some other form of international response.

Kerry told Syrian opposition leaders Thursday that he entered the talks with Lavrov “from a position of skepticism,” said a senior State Department official on condition of not being identified.

That sentiment was echoed by House Speaker John Boehner in Washington.

“I have doubts about the motives of the Russians and Assad,” Boehner said.

U.N. report on Syria coming

Obama had tried to put together a NATO coalition to attack Syria. But he ran into roadblocks, like the vote by Britain’s parliament – a normally reliable party – opting not to participate.

He then asked Congress to authorize a military response in Syria, but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the Russian proposal emerged Monday to provide a diplomatic opening.

While Kerry was in Geneva, Obama met with the rest of his Cabinet on Thursday and wished his absent secretary well.

“I am hopeful that the discussions that Secretary Kerry has with Foreign Minister Lavrov as well as some of the other players in this can yield a concrete result,” Obama told reporters. “And I know that he is going to working very hard over the next several days to see what the possibilities are there.”

Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told CNN on Thursday that Kerry will have his hands full with Lavrov, whom Cohen described as “very, very skilled,” “bright,” “articulate” and “a very tough negotiator.”

Thursday’s initial session revealed some of the dynamic between Kerry and Lavrov.

In their opening statements, Lavrov spoke first with mostly technical comments and then Kerry followed with longer and more forceful remarks. When he finished, Lavrov asked to respond and said he hadn’t come “prepared with the extended political statement,” adding that “diplomacy likes silence.”

Kerry then asked the translator to repeat Lavrov’s final comment, but when that didn’t happen, Lavrov tried to assure Kerry there was no problem.

“You want me to take your word for it? It’s a little early for that,” Kerry said, smiling, as the two men shook hands for the cameras.

In some potential good news for Obama, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday that a U.N. report on the August attack in Syria will “probably” be published on Monday, and that there will “certainly be indications” pointing to the origin of the attack.

France and other U.S. allies have said they want any international response on Syria to come under U.N. auspices, and the report by inspectors who traveled to the site of the attack would be a first step toward generating support for a Security Council resolution.

Obama makes case for action

The president insists he has the authority to attack Syria without congressional approval, but says he decided to seek the support of legislators for the sake of national unity.

In a speech Tuesday night, Obama made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on Syria, challenging Congress and the American public to look at video footage of victims and saying that letting al-Assad get away with it would harm the security of the United States and its allies.

Analysis: Obama a winner or loser on Syria?

Opponents of a U.S. military strike argue that it could lead to another quagmire in someone else’s civil war, and that Obama’s proposal for limited strikes would fail to achieve the objective of eliminating the threat of Syria’s chemical weapons.

Russian President Vladimir Putin injected himself into the American debate with an opinion piece first published late Wednesday on the New York Times website that argued against U.S. military intervention in Syria and implicitly criticized Obama.

The White House shrugged off Putin’s jabs at Obama as “irrelevant,” arguing that Russia’s diplomatic intervention over Syria’s chemical weapons meant that Putin now was “fully invested” in removing them from al-Assad’s control.

Meanwhile, a U.S. official told CNN that CIA-funded weapons have begun flowing to Syrian rebels, as pledged by the administration in June.

The artillery described as light weapons, some anti-tank weapons and ammunition are not American-made, but are funded and organized by the CIA. They started to reach rebels about two weeks ago, the official said.

Gen. Salim Idriss, the head of the Free Syrian Army, told CNN’s Christian Amanpour on Thursday that U.S. aid was reaching the rebels, though he didn’t detail whether that support includes weapons.

“We are getting now a lot of support from our American friends, but I can’t talk in detail about all kinds of the support,” Idriss said.

Congress approved supplying weapons to the rebels after the administration asserted earlier this year that the al-Assad regime had used chemical weapons on a small scale.

Before that, Obama had rejected calls by his national security team and members of Congress to increase direct military aid to the rebels.

Those pushing for arming the rebels argue such a step would counter Russian weapons supplied to al-Assad’s forces and strengthen the hand of moderate members of the Syrian opposition, making them less reliant on well-armed Islamic extremist elements within their ranks.

But a senior U.S. military official has said, “we do not see a clear division between moderates and extremists,” making it hard to back the opposition without supporting extremist elements as well.

While one U.S. official says “only a minority are extremist” – a reference to rebel fighters tied to the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front – U.S. officials familiar with intelligence assessments say many more rebel fighters than belong to that group may want to establish an Islamic state in Syria.

On the other side of the bloody war, al-Assad’s forces are getting support from at least 2,000 members of Hezbollah – a pro-Syrian group based in Lebanon that the United States has designed as a terrorist organization – U.S. officials estimate.

Everything,"Edward Snowden is now out of his limbo at Moscow’s airport, presumably ensconced in some Russian dacha, wondering what the next phase of his young life will bring. Having spent 30 years in the intelligence business, I fervently hope the food is lousy, the winter is cold, and the Internet access is awful. But I worry less about what happens to this one man and more about the damage Snowden has done — and could still do — to America’s long-term ability to strike the right balance between privacy and security.

Ever since Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, leaked top-secret material about its surveillance programs, he and the U.S. government have locked horns about the nature of those programs.

But those following the Snowden saga should understand two key points. First, though many things need to be kept secret in today’s dangerous world, the line between “secret” and “not secret” is fuzzy rather than stark, and if the goal is security, the harsh truth is that we should often err toward more secrets rather than fewer. Second, despite the grumbling from Snowden and his admirers, the U.S. government truly does make strenuous efforts not to violate privacy, not just because it respects privacy (which it does), but because it simply doesn’t have the time to read irrelevant emails or listen in on conversations unconnected to possible plots against American civilians.

Incidents like the Snowden affair put my former colleagues in the intelligence community in an impossible position. Yes, the official explanations about the virtues of data-collection efforts can sound self-justifying and vague. But they’re still right. I know firsthand that Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA director, is telling the truth when he talks about plots that have been preempted and attacks that have been foiled because of intelligence his agency collected. I know because I was on the inside, I have long held security clearances, and I participated in many of the activities he describes.

I spent years in the middle of the effort to identify, disentangle, and ultimately attack Al Qaeda. We didn’t operate in secrecy because we were ashamed. We operated in the dark because we had to. Al Qaeda and its affiliates study our actions. They learn from our mistakes. America is safer because we’ve made a point of understanding their methods better than they understand ours.

I understand the trade-offs here. But the intelligence community isn’t keeping things from the American people because we don’t trust them, but rather because once important security information is out there, anyone can access it, including those who would do us harm.

That’s why I find the Snowden controversy so frustrating. I realize many Americans don’t trust their government. I wish I could change that. I wish I could tell people the amazing things I witnessed during my 30 years in the CIA, that I’ve never seen people work harder or more selflessly, that for little money and long hours, people took it for granted that their flaws would be scrutinized and their successes ignored. But I’ve been around long enough to know that deep-rooted distrust of government is immune to stories from people like me. The conspiracy buffs are too busy howling in protest at the thought that their government could uncover how long they spent on the phone with their dear aunt.

Let me break this to you gently. The government is not interested in your conversations with your aunt, unless, of course, she is a key terrorist leader. More than 100 billion emails were sent every day last year — 100 billion, every day. In that vast mass of data lurk a few bits that are of urgent interest and vast terabytes of tedium that are not. Unfortunately, the metadata (the phone numbers, length of contact, and so forth, but not the content of the conversations) that sketch the contours of a call to your family member may fall into the same enormous bucket of information that includes information on the next terrorist threat. As Jeremy Bash, the former chief of staff of the CIA, memorably put it, “If you’re looking for a needle in the haystack, you need a haystack.”

Unfortunately, during the Snowden affair, many news outlets have spent more time examining ways the government could abuse the information it has access to while giving scant mention to the lengths to which the intelligence community goes to protect privacy. We have spent enormous amounts of time and effort figuring out how to disaggregate the important specks from the overwhelming bulk of irrelevant data.

This is done under tight and well-thought-out strictures. I witnessed firsthand the consequences of breaking the privacy rules of my former organization, the National Counterterrorism Center. As the center’s deputy director, I had to fire people, good people, and remove others from their posts for failing to follow the rules about how information could be accessed and used. It didn’t happen often, and it was never a malicious attempt to gather private information. We had mandatory training and full-time staffers to supervise privacy regulations. We used precious resources to hire lawyers and civil liberties experts to oversee our efforts. And on those few occasions when we made mistakes, the punishments were swift and harsh.

Yes, some things that are classified probably don’t need to be. That may undermine public trust and dilute our ability to protect the data that really need protecting. But some things — especially U.S. sources and methods — must be kept secret. Snowden didn’t offer fresh insight about a massive policy failure. Rather, he took upon himself the authority to decide what tradecraft the intelligence community needs to keep his fellow citizens safe. Sadly, Snowden has captured the public’s imagination and attention, and the government’s reaction now seems too little, too late and too reactive. But the intelligence community — always a less sympathetic protagonist than a self-styled whistle-blower — actually has a good story to tell about how seriously the government takes privacy issues. We should tell it.

Gen. John R. Allen, who commands the international forces in Afghanistan, had wanted to keep the bulk of the 66,000 U.S. troops in place through the summer, traditionally the heaviest months of fighting against Taliban insurgents.

But in recent weeks Allen’s advisors and top Obama administration officials have developed a timetable for steady reductions that would reduce troop levels to fewer than 66,000 this summer and to 25,000-30,000 in spring 2014, with further withdrawals later that year, the officials said.

The emerging consensus has narrowed the split between the Pentagon and the White House over the extent to which the U.S. needs to remain engaged militarily in Afghanistan to prevent the country from slipping back into lawlessness and civil war after the bulk of foreign troops withdraw.

The administration is still discussing the size of the American force that will remain in Afghanistan after 2014, talks that will intensify this week when Afghan President Hamid Karzai meets President Obama at the White House. Pentagon officials are pushing for 6,000 to 9,000 troops, though White House aides are considering a force of 3,000 or even fewer.

The plan to accelerate the pace of the U.S. drawdown has emerged as military planners have examined the cost and logistical complexity of waiting until next year to bring out tens of thousands of troops, the officials said.

Keeping troop levels near 60,000 would require the Pentagon to extend deployments of troops currently on nine-month deployments or to send additional units for short tours, officials said, noting that neither option is likely to be popular with the public or the White House.

Deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters Tuesday that Obama “is committed to continuing steady reductions,” and that “we are not going to plateau at” 66,000 until 2014 “and then remove our troops.”

At the same time, U.S. officials want to keep as many as 30,000 troops in Afghanistan through April 2014, when the nation is scheduled to hold elections to choose Karzai’s successor. That size force is considered large enough to serve as a deterrent to efforts by the Taliban to disrupt the elections or by presidential contenders to seize power by force, officials said.

Many senior military officers remain deeply concerned that the post-2014 U.S. troop presence under consideration is too small to meaningfully assist the fledgling Afghan security forces. But these officers acknowledge that they are unlikely to win the argument with a White House that is intent on reducing the U.S. footprint as much as possible.

Rhodes did not rule out the possibility that Obama could eventually decide to leave no U.S. troops in Afghanistan after 2014. The “zero option” would be considered, he said.

Whether or not troops remain, the U.S. will help Afghanistan with training, equipment and aid, Rhodes said.

Earlier concern among senior U.S. commanders that a rapid U.S. withdrawal could jeopardize security has eased as many Afghan army and police units have successfully taken over security responsibilities in some areas.

“That’s a surprising fact, so with that variable in play you have more room to maneuver,” said a U.S. official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The Obama administration is also making a renewed push for peace talks with some factions of the Taliban, in hope that reducing the strength of the insurgency will make it easier for Afghan security forces, which now number nearly 352,000, to handle security with limited U.S. backing.

“We believe ultimately that [negotiating ] is an essential part of a process that would lead to a more peaceful and stable Afghanistan,” White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.

The image was sent to reporters by Tanya Lokshina, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Russia who was invited to the meeting. The woman seated to Mr. Snowden’s right was Sarah Harrison, a British WikiLeaks activist; at his left was a translator. After the meeting ended, WikiLeaks released a full transcript of Mr. Snowden’s statement to the group and a brief video clip of the meeting was published on a Russian news site.

Video

In the video, obtained by Life News, Mr. Snowden read the beginning of his statement, saying: “A little over one month ago, I had family, a home in paradise, and I lived in great comfort. I also had the capability without any warrant to search for, seize, and read your communications. Anyone’s communications at any time. That is the power to change people’s fates. It is also a serious violation of the law. The 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of my country, Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and numerous statutes and treaties forbid such systems of massive, pervasive surveillance.”

After a pause for translation, he continued, “While the U.S. Constitution marks these programs as illegal, my government argues that secret court rulings —” at which point he was interrupted by an airport announcement, provoking laughter from the room. He commented wryly, “I’ve heard that many times in the last couple of weeks.”

More video of his statement, apparently shot from the same angle, was broadcast on Russian television later.

Ms. Lokshina also revealed that Mr. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, said that he has decided to apply for political asylum in Russia. When asked about Mr. Snowden earlier this month, President Vladimir V. Putin told reporters, “If he wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must cease his work aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners, as strange as it may sound from my lips.” (More information on the meeting, which was still in progress when this post was first published, will be added in updates below as it reaches us via @EllenBarryNYT and other reporters.)

Russia, for example, has insisted that Iran should participate. Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special envoy on Syria, has also urged that Iran take part.

The United States and its allies have opposed including Iran, which has sent members of its paramilitary Quds Force to help the Assad government and has been supplying arms as well.

American officials have not publicly been as forward leaning as Mr. Fabius on Iran’s inclusion in talks, which would be aimed at creating a transitional government with full authority. They appear to be waiting to see what happens at a Thursday session at which Iran’s new foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, will meet counterparts from the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany on Iran’s nuclear program.

A meeting between Mr. Zarif and the Security Council members, which would include Secretary of State John Kerry, would be one of the highest-level face-to-face contacts between Iran and the United States in more than three decades of estrangement. It would also be the first meeting of Mr. Kerry and Mr. Zarif in their current roles.

Mr. Zarif is an American-educated diplomat appointed by the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani. Both have sought to distinguish themselves from the hard-line approach of the last president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. They have been outspoken in asserting that Iran is ready to advance the negotiations on the nuclear dispute, which has drawn heavy Western sanctions and left the country increasingly isolated economically.

Iran has asserted that its uranium enrichment program is for peaceful purposes, denying assertions from the West and Israel that it is developing the capability to make nuclear weapons. The Israeli government, which particularly mistrusts Iran’s nuclear intentions, has dismissed the new Iranian diplomatic effort as a public relations maneuver.

Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, met with the Iranian foreign minister on Monday and described her discussions with him as constructive. Ms. Ashton said Mr. Zarif, whom she had never met face to face before Monday, had “talked about a number of issues but focused on the nuclear issue.”"

The White House’s goal is to persuade Congress to authorize a limited military strike against Syria to punish it for a deadly chemical weapons attack. But after a frenetic week of wall-to-wall intelligence briefings, dozens of phone calls and hours of hearings with senior members of Mr. Obama’s war council, more and more lawmakers, Republican and Democrat, are lining up to vote against the president.

Officials are guardedly optimistic about the Senate, but the blows keep coming. On Saturday, Senator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, perhaps the most endangered incumbent up for re-election, came out against the authorization to use force.

Snowden, whose U.S. passport was revoked after he began his globe-trotting flight from justice for leaking national security secrets, lamented in a statement posted on the WikiLeaks website that President Obama was obstructing his right to seek asylum by threatening countries willing to grant it.

Snowden has been holed up in a transit area of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport for more than a week and the strain of being trapped in a judicial standoff of his own making was palpable in his accusatory statement.

“One week ago I left Hong Kong after it became clear that my freedom and safety were under threat for revealing the truth,” the former National Security Agency contractor began.

After thanking friends, family and anonymous supporters for helping him retain his “liberty,” he accused Obama of diplomatic strong-arming countries “from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions.

“This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extra-legal penalty of exile,” Snowden wrote. “These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me.”

Snowden remains a U.S. citizen and administration officials have said his return to the United States would be facilitated if he decides to face the espionage charges brought against him.

“The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon,” Snowden lamented. “Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.”

He was issued special travel documents by Ecuadorean diplomats in Moscow last week. However, officials in Ecuador’s capital, Quito, canceled them, saying they were provided without proper authorization.

Ecuadorean officials initially hinted they would give refuge to the 30-year-old American. But the South American country could face serious economic consequences for rejecting any U.S. extradition request as $400 million in trade -- and 40,000 related jobs -- could be lost if Washington refuses to renew a trade pact with Quito that expired Sunday.

The unspoken threat may be behind the foot-dragging and retreat by Ecuador in the Snowden affair, even as the South American government publicly declared it would pull out of the trade deal of its own accord rather than face U.S. “blackmail.” Ecuadorean officials said late last week that any grant of political asylum would take months to decide and would have to take into consideration any negative consequences in its relations with Washington.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier Monday said Snowden could stay in Russia but only if he agreed to cease disclosing classified information that was “aimed at damaging our American partners.”

Other Russian officials disclosed to local news media that Snowden had submitted a request for asylum in Russia and 14 other countries, although they did not specify which other states he had approached.

It's John Kerry to the rescue! Secretary Kerry! In the middle of presenting Kerry's slam dunk case for why we absolutely, positively, must attack Syria, he inadvertently may have found an internationally acceptable peaceful resolution.



9/9/2013: REPORTER: Is there anything at this point that his government could do or offer that would stop an attack? JOHN KERRY: Uh, sure. He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week, turn it over. All of it. Without delay. And allow a full and total accounting for that. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously.

BRET BAIER (9/9/2013): The State Department quickly called that a rhetorical argument and not a real proposal from Kerry.

Well, guess which Middle Eastern despot doesn't appear to understand rhetorical devices.



BROOKE BALDWIN (9/9/2013): Syria's foreign minister says the country ""welcomes"" a proposal to put its chemical weapons under international control.

(video of Mr. Magoo unknowingly escaping death from a tiger)

Holy shit! Syria is taking him up on his dickish offer! Syria, through the auspices of Vladimir Putin's Russia, would like to take the international community and Secretary Kerry's generous offer to hold their weapons for them. No war, no costs, no blowback! How could any patriot view this as anything but a fantastic development?



STUART VARNEY (9/10/2013): President Obama has just led us into a humiliating defeat.

Who cares how we avoided a war and got a dictator to give up his chemical weapons, if we avoided a war and got a dictator to give up his chemical weapons?



TUCKER CARLSON (9/9/2013): This strengthens Russia and humiliates the United States. SEAN HANNITY (9/9/2013): Now Vladimir Putin has filled the leadership gap. CNBC ANCHOR (9/10/2013): I think Lindsey Graham's on the tape saying that the Russians have played us like a fiddle.

And I get that Fox opposes a Syria peace plan because its modus operandi is to foment dissent in the form of a relentless and irrational contrarianism to Barack Obama on all things democratic, to advance its ultimate objective of creating a deliberately misinformed body politic whose fear, anger, mistrust, and discontent is the manna upon which it sustains its parasitic succubus-like existence. (MASSIVE audience cheering and applause)

And uh, but.... Sorry, I blacked out for a second, was I saying something?

But for some reason, even CNN's Chris Cuomo seemed disappointed with the turn of events.



CHRIS CUOMO (9/10/2013): A Russian proposal to have Syria hand over its chemical weapons could change what the President has to say, could change the entire debate. But should it?

Look, cuz isn't that the problem now? News networks aren't invested in right or wrong, they're invested in momentum. Ah, you can take us to war on false intelligence and pretense, but God forbid you rev us up for war, and you don't deliver. The one thing we won't tolerate in this country is a little war foreplay without the payoff. You can make disastrous foreign policy decisions, but you will not give this country a case of blue bombs. We'll be right back."

The leaders’ joint appearance concluded a tone-setting first day of Obama’s first presidential trip to Israel, a visit celebrated with military ceremony, children’s serenades and a rare personal chemistry with a hard-line Israeli leader with whom Obama has often bickered publicly.

In particular, Obama and Netanyahu, appearing at an evening news conference, reached what seemed to be a consensus regarding Iran’s uranium-enrichment program.

Iran denies that the program is designed to develop a nuclear weapon, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Netanyahu and Obama, who advocates a diplomatic solution to the matter, have disagreed over how much time remains before a military strike against Iran is necessary to slow down the program.

Obama said recently that he thinks Iran is a year from achieving a nuclear-weapons capability, a timeline that has differed from Israeli assessments. On Wednesday, Netanyahu moved closer to Obama’s timeline — and even softened his certainty about Iran’s intent — to allow more space for diplomacy.

“I think that there’s a misunderstanding about time,” Netanyahu said. “If Iran decides to go for a nuclear weapon — that is, to actually manufacture the weapon — then it will take them about a year.”

Obama, in turn, reiterated his support for Israel’s right to self-defense. He pledged to seek additional funding for the Iron Dome system, which he saw when he swung by an anti-missile battery after his arrival at Ben Gurion International Airport.

The system, which shot down hundreds of Gaza-fired rockets in November, will receive $200 million in U.S. funding this fiscal year. Obama said he and Netanyahu will begin talks to extend the U.S.-Israeli military aid agreement beyond its current 2017 expiration.

“Israel’s security needs are truly unique, as I’ve seen myself,” Obama said. “And flying in today, I saw again how Israel’s security can be measured in mere miles and minutes.”

The warm display by Obama and Netanyahu comes against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Middle East, shifting politically and culturally through war, protest and elections.

It is too soon to tell whether the two leaders have overcome past differences, which have played out in venues as public as the Oval Office. But the signs of a stronger U.S.-Israel relationship may put new pressure on Iran’s leaders, who Obama said Wednesday must be convinced that it is not in their interest to pursue a nuclear weapon.

Obama’s visit to the prime minister’s official residence featured a surprising levity between two men whose public posture together has more often than not been dour, angry and hectoring.

Upon arrival at Netanyahu’s residence, Obama invited the prime minister’s wife, Sara Netanyahu, to stand between the two for a photo. “A rose between the thorns,” Obama joked.

He and Netanyahu, appearing relaxed and jovial, chatted while Obama signed a guest book. The prime minister complained about how hard it was to form a government in Israel’s multi-party system, telling Obama, “You have only one party” to compete with.

“The grass is always greener, my friend,” the president replied.

When Obama later teased Netanyahu during the news conference that his “handsome sons” got their looks from their mother, a grinning Netanyahu responded, “I could say the same thing about your daughters.”

And as Israeli television captured the president’s arrival live, a shot of Obama removing his suit jacket to stroll along the tarmac captured Netanyahu doing the same moments later, a strutting camaraderie not seen previously from the two leaders.

Obama is packing a lot into his three-day trip to Israel and the occupied West Bank, where he is scheduled to meet Thursday morning with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.

The trip, on which he is accompanied by his new secretary of state, John F. Kerry, is a mission of remedial diplomacy after a difficult first term with the United States’ closest Middle Eastern ally and a deeply disillusioned set of Palestinian leaders.

Obama’s early demand that Netanyahu cease settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem — areas, along with Gaza, that Palestinians consider part of their future state — created a rift that became a bitter campaign issue in last year’s U.S. election.

In his 2009 address to the Islamic world in Cairo, Obama said he would not accept the “legitimacy” of continued Israeli settlement construction in the occupied territories, activity that many legal experts say violates international law.

His decision not to stop in Israel after that speech — he instead visited the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany to highlight Jewish suffering during the Holocaust — raised concern among many Israelis that Obama did not understand their nation’s biblical roots.

Immediately on arrival Wednesday, Obama began to address those lingering concerns, which stirred resentment even among the slice of the Israeli electorate that supports the creation of a Palestinian state.

As he spoke from the airport tarmac, Obama began with a simple “Shalom,” the common Hebrew salutation, which, literally translated, means “peace.” He then set out to repair the impression he made during his first term.

“More than 3,000 years ago, the Jewish people prayed here, tended the land here, prayed to God here,” Obama said at the welcome ceremony. “And after centuries of exile and persecution, unparalleled in the history of man, the founding of the Jewish state of Israel was a rebirth, a redemption unlike any in history.”

In addition to the Iranian nuclear program, Obama and Netanyahu said they agree on the dangers posed by the widening civil war in Syria.

Obama defended his policy toward Syria — where an estimated 70,000 people have been killed — citing the international sanctions he has helped organize against President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

But he also said that the use of chemical weapons by Syria’s government, which Syrian rebels alleged occurred on Tuesday, would be a “game-changer” prompting a more direct, if unspecified, U.S. response.

Netanyahu’s hard-line Likud party lost seats in the January elections, and he now heads a governing coalition more moderate and secular than his last.

Whether that will translate into a new peace process is unclear, as Israelis focus on the domestic issues around which much of the election was fought.

Obama said he will speak Thursday about how to revive direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations with Abbas — and, later that evening, to young Israelis in a speech at the Jerusalem International Convention Center.

Direct talks between the two parties have been dormant, except for a brief period in the fall of 2010, for more than four years.

But Obama received a boost Wednesday from Netanyahu, who in the past has endorsed the creation of a Palestinian state with so many caveats that Palestinian leaders have dismissed the notion as a ploy.

In his opening statement, Netanyahu said, “Israel remains fully committed to peace and to the solution of two states for two peoples.” It was one of his strongest public comments in favor of a Palestinian state.

Obama acknowledged that he is not bringing new ideas for how to begin those talks, saying that he “purposely did not come here with some big announcement that did not necessarily meet the realities on the ground.”

“I’m absolutely sure that there are a host of things that I could have done that would have been more deft and would have created better optics,” Obama said of his first-term efforts. “But ultimately, this is a really hard problem.”"

Special for USA TODAY

Netanyahu says Israel will not be bound by the agreement

Says %22Israel will not let Iran develop nuclear military capability%22

Cabinet official says deal allows Iran to continue enriching uranium

JERUSALEM — The Israeli government called the deal reached with Iran over its nuclear program a ""historic mistake,"" saying it only slows a nuclear program that will still be capable of producing a bomb.

Speaking to his Cabinet on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the agreement endangered Israel, adding the nation is not bound by the international community's nuclear deal and reserves the right to defend itself.

""What was reached last night in Geneva is not a historic agreement, it is a historic mistake,"" Netanyahu said. ""Today the world became a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world made a significant step in obtaining the most dangerous weapons in the world.""

""We're worried about the agreement but our job is to keep up the warnings,"" said Yair Lapid, Israel's Minister of Finance and part of Netanyahu's coalition government. ""We're not comfortable but this warning needs to be done. We have six months until there is (hopefully) a better agreement.Voicing what he called Israel's right to self-defense, he said, ""I want to clarify that Israel will not let Iran develop nuclear military capability.""

""We may be the only child in the room saying the king has no clothes but that's what we must do.""

An official in the Prime Minister's office said the agreement ""gives Iran exactly what it wants: a significant easing of sanctions and allows Iran to keep the most significant parts of its nuclear program. The agreement allows Iran to continue enriching uranium and leaves it the centrifuges that enables it create (fissile) material to create nuclear weapons. Likewise, the agreement doesn't lead to dismantling the Arak reactor. The economic pressure on Iran would have led to a much better agreement that would have dismantled Iran's nuclear capability.""

The White House said the interim deal limits Iran's existing stockpiles of enriched uranium, which can be turned into the fissile core of nuclear arms. The accord curbs the number and capabilities of the centrifuges used to enrich and limits Iran's ability to ""produce weapons-grade plutonium"" from a reactor in the advanced stages of construction.

FIRST TAKE:Obama takes historic shot with Iran deal

Iran's nuclear program will also be subject to ""increased transparency and intrusive monitoring."" In return, the White House said economic sanctions on Iran imposed to get it to curtail its nuclear activity will be eased.

Uri Savir, a former Israeli ambassador and president of the The Peres Center for Peace, called the deal an ""historic agreement,"" saying it will go a long way to limit Iran's nuclear program for six months and could also jump start progress on Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He lauded Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, ""who despite opposition advanced global peace diplomacy.""

Nafatali Bennett, the Minister of Economy and Commerce, said on Army Radio that world powers could have used the talks in Geneva that led to the deal to force Iran to give up its nuclear program rather than freeze it at a point where it can resume work at any time.

""Iran was on the mat because of the sanctions, but then the West picked it up and gave it something to drink. Israel does not have to be a party to this agreement and has the right to defend its security,"" he said, alluding to possible military action. ""The whole Middle East is affected but the danger to Israel is unique.""

In early-morning Facebook posts, Israelis compared the deal to the one made by former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who brokered an agreement with Nazi Germany in 1938 that did nothing to prevent a world war as promised.

Josh Hasten, who hosts a political radio show, told USA TODAY that, ""There is no doubt that the leaders in Iran are smiling this morning as they have been given a pass by the world community to maintain the option of building a nuclear weapon.""

He described the deal as an appeasement that will leave the entire world and not just Israel at risk of a nuclear Iran.

""It's truly a major step in the wrong direction,"" he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/deal-struck-wider-un-inspections-iran-sites-101515310.html,,[],Deal struck on wider UN inspections of Iran sites,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran agreed Monday to offer more information and expanded access to U.N. nuclear inspectors — including more openings at a planned reactor and uranium site — even as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Iranian envoys had backed away from a wider deal seeking to ease Western concerns that Tehran could one day develop atomic weapons.

But Iran's foreign minister criticized Kerry's remarks, saying the American's ""conflicting statements"" damaged confidence in the process, adding that ""considerable progress was made"" in Geneva.

The flurry of announcements and comments showed both the complexities and urgency in trying to move ahead on an accord between Iran and world powers after overtime talks in Geneva failed to produce a deal that could curb Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for a rollback in some U.S.-led economic sanctions.

With negotiators set to resume next week, Iranian officials promoted the pact reached with the U.N. nuclear chief Yukiya Amano as a ""roadmap"" for greater cooperation and transparency, which could move the talks ahead. But the plans do not mention some of the sites most sought by U.N. teams to probe suspicions of nuclear-related work, notably the Parchin military facility outside Tehran.

""It's an important step forward, but by no means the end of the process,"" Amano told The Associated Press in Tehran. ""There is still much work to be done.""

Western leaders, meanwhile, were keen to display a unified front after suggestions that France had broken ranks in Geneva and demanded more concessions from Iran on enrichment levels and an under-construction heavy water reactor that produced a greater amount of plutonium byproduct, which could be used in eventual weapons production. Kerry said it was Iran that put the brakes on reaching a first-phase agreement, but gave no details on the Iranian concerns and suggested it was only a matter of time before a formula is found.

""There was unity but Iran couldn't take it,"" Kerry said during a stop in Abu Dhabi. He added: ""The French signed off on it, we signed off on it.""

Story continues

Kerry told the BBC on Monday that negotiators had been ""very, very close ... extremely close"" to reaching a deal with Iran.

""I think we were separated by four or five different formulations of a particular concept,"" he said.

In the BBC interview, Kerry acknowledged ""the French have been more vocal about one thing or another."" But he said, ""the fact is that we had a unity on Saturday in a proposal put in front of the Iranians. But because of some the changes they felt they had to go back and change it.""

Later Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif criticized Kerry's remarks that blamed Iran for lack of a deal when asked about them on an Iranian TV talk show.

""Conflicting statements harm the credibility of the one who keeps changing positions and damages confidence. The goal of dialogue is to reduce the lack of trust. Conflicting talk doesn't give credit to the person saying it,"" Zarif said.

He said ""considerable progress"" was made during three days of talks in Geneva but claimed that most of the hours were spent with the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany trying ""to resolve differences among themselves."" He said he's still hopeful a deal will be reached, but insisted any agreement must include the lifting of all Western sanctions against Iran.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the world powers presented a united front to Iran at the weekend talks that failed to reach an accord, and although ""some gaps"" remained between parties at the talks, ""most of those gaps are narrow.""

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that an overall deal is likely between Iran and world powers, which would undercut Israeli threats to launch military action against Iranian nuclear sites. Yet he hailed the delay as a chance to ""achieve a much better deal.""

""The target date for this deal is the date on which a good deal will be achieved that will deny Iran a military nuclear capability,"" he told Israel's parliament Monday.

For Netanyahu and his backers, however, hopes have all but evaporated that Iran can be forced by negotiators to completely end its ability to make nuclear fuel. It's now unclear what type of deal would satisfy Israel, which sees a nuclear-armed Iran as a threat to its existence.

Iran has categorically denied it seeks nuclear arms and insists its only seeks reactors for energy and medical applications. Iranian officials portrayed the expanded U.N. access as further sign it seeks to work with the West.

Under the plans, announced at a joint news conference, Iran would allow inspectors a first-time visit of its key Gachin uranium mine on the Gulf coast and give broader access to the heavy water facility being built in the central city of Arak. Heavy water reactors use a different type of coolant to produce a greater amount of plutonium byproduct than conventional reactors. Inspectors from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, have already visited the reactor site but seek more extensive examinations.

Plutonium can be used in nuclear weapons production, but separating it from the reactor byproducts requires a special technology that Iran does not currently possess.

The new accord also calls on Iran to provide more details on its nuclear program including proposed new reactor sites and all planned research reactors. This is important because such facilities use 20 percent enriched uranium, which is the highest level acknowledged by Iran and a key aspect of the ongoing nuclear talks. Halting the 20 percent enrichment — which is several steps away from weapons-grade — is a key goal of Western envoys, for which they may offer Iran a possible easing of U.S.-led sanctions.

IAEA teams have combed Iran for years and have around-the-clock monitoring systems at main sites such as the Russian-built reactor at Bushehr on the Gulf coast and the biggest enrichment facility at Natanz in central Iran. Inspectors also have visited a once-secret enrichment lab, known as Fordo, built into a mountainside south of Tehran after it was disclosed in 2009.

But some areas remain off-limits despite repeated demands from the IAEA.

Chief among them is the Parchin military base outside Tehran, which has been visited by IAEA inspectors in the past. They have been blocked, however, from returning to investigate suspicions that explosive tests were carried out related to possible nuclear triggers. Iran denies the allegations, but has resisted opening the base.

It was unclear whether the openings made Monday would eventually extend to sites such as Parchin. Amano said it would be ""raised in subsequent"" meetings.

Iran's nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the pact is intended as ""a roadmap that clarifies the mutual steps required for resolving the outstanding issues"" — points repeatedly raised by President Hassan Rouhani since taking office in August.

A joint statement by Salehi and Amano said both sides seek to ""cooperate further ... to resolve all present and past issues."" The IAEA, in a nod to Iran's concerns, also agreed to protect confidential information regarding its nuclear program.

Pleas for President Obama to toughen his stance on Russia have fallen on deaf ears.

A project to build Russian facilities on U.S. soil has raised concerns within the CIA and the Pentagon.

Putin%27s Russia appears increasingly emboldened by Obama administration promises of %22flexibility%22

It appears that pleas for President Obama to toughen his stance on Russia have fallen on deaf ears. Despite a litany of brazen power plays by Moscow, the Obama administration is now considering a proposal that could enhance Russia's capability to spy on the United States. The Senate will soon have an opportunity to ensure that this proposal and any others like it in the future do not put America's national security interests at risk.

Many Americans were stunned when, on November 16, news reports surfaced that Russian Space agency Roscosmos is close to gaining approval for the construction of half-a-dozen satellite ground monitoring stations on U.S. soil. It is disturbing that it took leaks to the media from defense and intelligence officials for Americans to discover that such an audacious proposal was even under review.

The stated purpose of the Russian-controlled monitoring stations is to improve Moscow's global positioning network, but logic dictates that the stations would also give Russia a prime vantage point to spy on the United States from within our own borders.

The project has rightly stirred serious concerns within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Pentagon. As Department of Defense (DoD) and CIA officials have warned, Russia could use these stations to gather intelligence and provide its satellite-guided weapons with pinpoint accuracy.

I have personally reviewed the classified report from DoD on this issue. I share DoD's alarm.

The disagreement between these agencies and the State Department suggests a troubling tug-of-war within the Obama administration over how to counter Russia's growing boldness. From agreements to reduce nuclear stockpiles to scrapping our Eastern European missile defense system, the administration's naïve attempts to ""reset"" relations with Russia continue to ignore the fact that President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly refused to cooperate with the United States. Instead, Putin seems to relish any opportunity to mock U.S. power.

Here is just how badly the ""reset"" has gone this year: In January, Russia's ban on U.S. adoptions took effect, victimizing his country's most vulnerable citizens in a desperate act of retaliation against criticism of Russia's human rights offenders. In August, Russia granted asylum to U.S. fugitive Edward Snowden, who is charged with espionage and theft of U.S. government property after releasing up to 200,000 classified documents to the media. Not to mention that Russia has defended the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

It is time to stop pretending that Russia is genuinely interested in engaging in good-faith efforts to advance bilateral relations with the United States. Putin's Russia appears increasingly emboldened by the Obama administration's promises of ""flexibility"" and reluctance to challenge Russia's insults. Alongside the rollback of democratic progress and declining rule of law within Russia, today's tense relations are reminiscent of an era prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall.

So far, the pushback from DoD and the Intelligence community has forced the administration to delay a final decision on Russia's proposed GPS stations, but I am hopeful my Senate colleagues will support legislation to add transparency to this urgent and serious matter. My amendment to the 2014 Defense Authorization bill would require both the Secretary of Defense and Director of National Intelligence to certify that any U.S.-based GPS stations controlled by foreign governments are not capable of gathering intelligence or improving foreign weapons systems. This determination would be made before any construction could be authorized.

The Obama administration should seize this opportunity to reaffirm that America's national security interests will not be jeopardized by attempts to appease Russia's own strategic pursuits. A better ""reset"" would be one that rebuilds public confidence in the administration's handling of its relationship with Russia.

Darrell Issa and released today finds numerous failings in the ARB report on Benghazi released last year. The new report overturns some of the conclusions of the official ARB report. It finds that Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who was not criticized in the ARB report, should have been held accountable.

The new report is based on public statements but also on transcripts of numerous interviews undertaken since the release of the ARB report. It concurs with some portions of the earlier ARB report and disputes others. For instance, the new report finds that Charlene Lamb was at fault for decisions she made with regard to security in Libya. However the new report also provides a partial basis for exonerating Lamb since evidence suggests that every personnel decisions related to Libya was directly approved (or disapproved) by Under Secretary Kennedy.

A key exchange appears on page 63 of the report when Committee staff interview Deputy Assistant Secretary for Maghreb Affairs Maxwell about the involvement of Under Secretary Kennedy in events taking place in Libya prior to the 9/11 attack [Emphasis in original]:

Q.The DCM, Mr. Hicks, testified that Ambassador Kennedy was very engaged on a minute level about the incidents that were occurring in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks. A.Yep. Q. Does that surprise you? A. It does not. We–one of the things that I found interesting was that the Under Secretary approved every person that went in or came out of Tripoli… * * * A. The DAS Assistant Secretary reports to the Under Secretary for Management. The way the Under Secretary for Management runs things, there is no decision that DS makes that doesn’t have his input and his imprimatur, his approval. There is no decision that DS doesn’t make that doesn’t have his disapproval. DS–the Under Secretary for Management speaks for DS for all practical purposes, and there is no decision that DS makes that the Under Secretary for Management is not involved in. Q.So, the important decisions about the security posture in Libya leading up to the attacks, if Mr. Boswell was held accountable for those decisions, is it fair to say that the Under Secretary for Management would have had a role in those decisions? A. Absolutely.

Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell, one of the four individuals named in the ARB report, also told Oversight staff that Kennedy was the “ultimate decisionmaker” when it came to the removal of the SST team from Libya. This was the team of soldiers which Ambassador Stevens and others hoped to keep in Libya but which was removed weeks before the attack. Boswell also told Oversight staffers that “any decision about travel in and out, staffing levels was made by” Kennedy. This included both the assignment of diplomatic staff and security personnel.

Executive Director of the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau Lee Lohman told Oversight that he attended a meeting at which Kennedy personally examined schematics for the villa in Benghazi. Lohman said Kennedy was “heavily” involved in choosing the facility.

The report also points out that Kennedy was the single individual who, based on a staff recommendation, approved keeping the Benghazi post open as a temporary facility for an additional year. It was because the compound was temporary and not a permanent site that its security was staffed on a temporary basis by DS agents on leave from other positions. The temporary staffing system was intended to fill single openings or gaps in staffing on a short term basis, not provide and entire staff indefinitely. As a result, DS never had a full security compliment in place in Benghazi.

The new report also criticizes Kennedy’s role in presenting a false image of accountability to the public. Under Secretary Kennedy informed Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell that he had been singled out in the ARB report. Boswell offered his resignation and Kennedy accepted it. However Kennedy simultaneously encouraged Boswell to hang on to another position he held. A few days later, Kennedy told Boswell he was being placed on administrative leave. However, quoting Boswell from the Oversight interview, Kennedy told Boswell “he didn’t think it would last long.”

The Oversight report strongly suggests that the ARB report should have assigned blame to Under Secretary Kennedy for his involvement in numerous decisions which created the lax security situation in Benghazi.

After the discussions, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, and his team met for about an hour at the United Nations headquarters here with the American delegation, led by Wendy Sherman, a senior State Department official. The substance was not disclosed, but the meeting itself was unusual.

The proposal presented by the foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, at negotiations on Iran’s disputed nuclear program, called for “an end to an unnecessary crisis and a start for new horizons,” according to Iranian officials.

In a possible sign that the negotiations have turned serious after years of delay and obfuscations, a senior State Department official suggested that the discussions had been workmanlike."

Three American civilians and three U.S. troops were killed in two attacks in Afghanistan on Saturday, officials said, including a powerful blast that struck officials traveling to a school to donate books. Among the dead was the first State Department diplomat to be killed in the country since the war began.

The bloodshed Saturday, the deadliest day this year for Americans in Afghanistan, underscored how dangerous the country remains as the United States proceeds with the withdrawal of its remaining troops over the next 20 months, leaving security in the hands of Afghanistan’s fledgling army.

The attacks suggested that even as the military coalition’s focus shifts to managing the drawdown, the United States appears likely to face an intense “fighting season,” the springtime period in Afghanistan during which violence typically in­creases.

The American diplomat killed Saturday was identified as Anne Smedinghoff by her parents. Smedinghoff was recently tasked with assisting Secretary of State John F. Kerry on his trip to Kabul.

Four other State Department officials who were with her, traveling to a school in the southern province of Zabul, were injured in the same bombing, one critically, Kerry said in a statement.

“She was everything a Foreign Service Officer should be: smart, capable, eager to serve, and deeply committed to our country and the difference she was making for the Afghan people,” Kerry said. “She tragically gave her young life working to give young Afghans the opportunity to have a better future.”

In a somber address to State Department employees in Istanbul, Kerry paid tribute to Smedinghoff.

There is no greater contradiction, Kerry said, between Smedinghoff's zeal to ""change the world"" and help others and a bomber who he said drove a car into their vehicle.

""Folks who want to kill people, and that's all they want to do, are scared of knowledge. They want to shut the doors,"" Kerry said.

""Here is a huge challenge for us. Here's a confrontation with modernity, with possibilities, with everything that our country stands for.""

Smedinghoff, 25, served as Kerry’s main embassy guide and aide during his two-day visit late last month. That assignment, as a “control officer,” is considered an honor and a mark of promise for young Foreign Service officers.

The diplomat began an assignment as a press officer in Kabul last summer after spending two years at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, where she worked in the consular section. Smedinghoff graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a degree in international relations, said her parents, Tom and Mary Beth Smedinghoff.

The Smedinghoffs, who live in the Chicago area, said in an e-mail that their daughter joined the State Department straight out of college.

“She particularly enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with the Afghan people and was always looking for opportunities to reach out and help to make a difference in the lives of those living in a country ravaged by war,” they said. “We are consoled knowing that she was doing what she loved, and that she was serving her country by helping to make a positive difference in the world.”

The attacks came as Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived in Afghanistan to take stock of the war as U.S. officials continue to deliberate how quickly they should pull out the 68,000 American troops still deployed there.

Saturday’s violence followed a coordinated attack Wednesday in the country’s relatively safe west that killed at least 46 people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault in Farah province, saying it had been carried out to avenge the group’s fighters who have been “kept in prisons for years on end and even mercilessly given the death penalty.”

In the deadlier of the two attacks Saturday, in Zabul province’s Qalat district, insurgents detonated a bomb when a convoy transporting U.S. troops and State Department officials and another one carrying the governor of the province intersected. The blast, in an area that has long been a Taliban stronghold, killed three U.S. service members, the young diplomat and a U.S. Defense Department employee.

The Associated Press reported that the governor survived the attack but that an Afghan doctor was killed in the explosion.

In a statement, the Taliban said the attack was carried out at noon when a militant detonated explosives packed in a vehicle as the provincial governor was approaching the Americans. A Taliban spokesman told the AP that militants linked to the group were hoping to strike a U.S. or an Afghan government convoy when they placed the bomb. “We were waiting for one of them,” spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi said. “It was our good luck that both appeared at the same time.”

In the east, meanwhile, a third American civilian was killed in an “insurgent attack,” according to a statement issued by the military coalition in Kabul. It offered no further details.

Dempsey, the country’s top U.S. military official, told reporters traveling with him that he was heartened by what U.S. officials have described as spontaneous rebellions against the Taliban that have unfolded in recent months as the U.S. presence in the country has thinned. He expressed hope that a political solution will lead at least some segments of the Taliban to join the political process, according to remarks published by the American Forces Press Service, a Pentagon news division.

“Any conflict in history, when it is resolved, is resolved through some form of reconciliation,” Dempsey said. “I support the effort to try . . . through the Afghans to encourage them to take reconciliation as an important line of effort.”

Kerry, who traveled Saturday to the Middle East, spoke to the woman’s parents to offer “what little comfort I can for their immeasurable loss.”

“As the father of two daughters, I can’t imagine what their family is feeling today,” he said.

Tom Smedinghoff said his daughter died in the pursuit of a career she loved.

“The world lost a truly beautiful soul today,” he said. “She was such a wonderful woman--strong, intelligent, independent, and loving.”

http://news.yahoo.com/us-obama-regional-agenda-urgent-israel-visit-114201136.html,,[],US: Obama regional agenda 'urgent' on Israel visit,"JERUSALEM (AP) — President Barack Obama will bring an ""urgent"" agenda to Israel on his upcoming visit, focusing on regional developments including Iran and Syria as well as the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, U.S. Ambassador Dan Shapiro said Wednesday.

Shapiro spoke a day after the White House announced Obama will visit Israel, the West Bank and Jordan in the spring, at the start of his second term and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's third term. Obama's previous term in office saw relations with Netanyahu deteriorate in part over failed talks with the Palestinians but also due to the two leaders' different world views. The visit will be Obama's first as president to the staunch U.S. ally.

Shapiro gave several interviews to Israeli media Wednesday morning with the same message.

""We have a very urgent agenda,"" Shapiro told Army radio. ""He (Obama) wanted in his first trip of his second term to speak with the prime minister about this urgent agenda, about Iran, about our joint efforts to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons and stop its support of terrorism. And about Syria, the dangers in Syria and how to prevent ... the chemical weapons from falling into dangerous hands,"" Shapiro said.

""We have a very complex agenda about Iran, Syria and the need to get Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, so it's important to begin as fast as possible,"" he added.

The White House has not released the date of Obama's trip or details about Obama's itinerary, but Israel's Channel 10 reported it had been scheduled for March 20. The visit raises expectations that peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which collapsed about four years ago, can be rekindled.

Palestinians refuse to resume the talks unless Israel stops building in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says talks should resume without any preconditions, and has even stepped up construction in the territories since the U.N. recognized a de facto state of Palestine there in November.

Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said he welcomes the visit, which he hopes will result in the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

Shapiro said that Obama will meet during his visit the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank along with the King of Jordan, who has had a role in peacemaking efforts.

""President Obama is not coming with conditions or demands. He is coming to confer with all our partners about problems and challenges we are dealing with in the region,"" Shapiro told Israel radio.

He said that Obama isn't ""seeking a specific result"" but wants to confer about ways of ""bringing Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiation table.""

Although Obama visited Israel and Jordan while running for president in 2008, he hasn't been back since, drawing intense criticism from some pro-Israel groups who have claimed he is insufficiently supportive of the United States' closest Mideast ally. Other top administration officials, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have visited, and Clinton's replacement, John Kerry, is expected to travel to Israel on his first Mideast trip.

Shapiro said Obama will visit after Israel's new government has been formed.

The announcement of the visit comes at a time of uncertainty for Netanyahu, who left January's election weakened. The emergence of a new centrist party in Israel's election offered hope to those urging the hawkish Netanyahu to make peace with the Palestinians a higher priority.

Shapiro shrugged off questions about relations between Obama and Netanyahu. ""The personal chemistry between them is excellent. They know how to work together,"" he said.

Obama will also discuss Iran's nuclear program, the danger of Syrian chemical weapons reaching militants and other regional issues, Shapiro said."

http://news.yahoo.com/pirates-kidnap-americans-commercial-ship-165734331.html,,[],Pirates kidnap Americans from commercial ship,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Pirates kidnapped two Americans working on a commercial ship near the coast of Nigeria, U.S. officials said Thursday. And the Nigerian navy ordered its forces to mount a rescue operation.

""We are seeking additional information so we can contribute to the safe resolution of the situation,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""Our principal concern now is the safe return of two American citizens.""

The captain and an engineer were taken away from an offshore supply vessel during an attack Wednesday in international waters off the Gulf of Guinea, said a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the information.

The two were kidnapped from the U.S.-flagged C-Retriever, a 222-foot ship owned by Edison Chouest Offshore of Louisiana, the official said. The vessel and 11 other members of the crew were released and the two hostages were believed taken to shore in Nigeria, the official said.

Nigerian navy Capt. Kabir Aliyu confirmed that there was an attack. He said the Nigerian navy has directed its operational commands and bases ""to search (for) and rescue the crew members and the vessel."" Aliyu did not respond to a question asking whether the Nigerian navy was working with U.S. Marines who are in the area for training.

A spokesman for the U.S. company did not return multiple phone calls and emails seeking comment. It was unclear whether a ransom demand or any other demands had been made.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. has been concerned by ""a disturbing increase"" in maritime crime, including piracy, in the area.

Asked what the U.S. would do about the incident and about the long-term piracy issue in Nigeria, she said, ""At this point, we're still looking into it. ... We are concerned by this increase. We've worked and will continue to work with states on the Gulf of Guinea to help them respond effectively to maritime crime in these waters.""

The U.S. defense official said the U.S. Navy was monitoring the situation and that the closest military vessel was a Dutch navy ship in the Gulf of Guinea with 90 U.S. Marines aboard as part of an Africa training mission.

UNB residence elevator eyed as possible source Public Health is investigating whether an elevator could be the source of transmission in the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus residence COVID-19 outbreak that still stands at 12 positive cases, as of Monday. Last week, Public Health and UNB looked into the ventilation system at Magee House and determined ""the risk is minimal,"" said Department of Health spokesperson Bruce Macfarlane. ""Public Health officials are now focusing their efforts to determine surface contacts within the elevator as the potential source of transmission,"" he said in an email. UNB's Magee House residence has about 180 adults and children living in the 101 apartment-style units, according to resident Martin Kutnowski.(Ed Hunter/CBC) According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, COVID-19 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets and aerosols (smaller droplets) created when an infected person talks, sings, shouts, coughs or sneezes. COVID-19 can also spread by touching something that has the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands, the agency's website states. The outbreak at Magee House involves the variant first reported in India, which has two mutations that make it ""more concerning than all the others,"" Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Jennifer Russell has said. It is ""very, very, very aggressive in terms of being contagious and causing more severe symptoms."" Magee House is a seven-storey apartment-style residence designed for mature students, some of whom have families. The residents remain in isolation as Public Health deals with the outbreak. Paul Mazerolle, president and vice-chancellor of the University of New Brunswick, says isolation needs to happen at Magee House to prevent the spread of COVID-19.(Ed Hunter/CBC) Meanwhile, the UNB campus reopened Monday, as did the adjacent St Thomas University campus and nearby New Brunswick Community College campus, more than a week after they moved to essential services only in response to the outbreak. Faculty, staff and students can now go on campus as long as they follow relevant operational guidelines. ""COVID is difficult,"" said Paul Mazerolle, president of the University of New Brunswick. ""The uncertainty creates concern and we're not through this."" Monday marks day nine of the Magee House lockdown, and a third round of mass testing was scheduled for residents and staff on Sunday. As of Monday afternoon, Public Health was still awaiting the results. Alex Hill-Stosky, who lives with his family in Magee House, said many people in the building are either anxious or angry because of the lockdown. ""A lot of people feel we are test subjects rather than people,"" said the engineering student. Residents of Magee House at the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton are in quarantine after at least 12 people tested positive for COVID-19. (Maria Jose Burgos/CBC) Mazerolle said he understands people are concerned and worried about their personal freedoms, but it's important to limit the spread of the virus. ""To minimize the potential spread, unfortunately people's movements need to be restricted for a limited period of time. … If we didn't restrict movement, we could be in a much worse situation."" Students have also expressed concerns over the residence's ventilation system. Mazerolle said the ventilation system has been checked twice and deemed safe by engineers with Public Health and the Department of Environment. ""From what I've been told by the experts, there's no evidence to suggest that the ventilation system is putting people at risk for COVID-19. Mazerolle expects Magee House to reopen on Saturday. ""We're looking forward to this coming to an end,"" he said. Public Health said the isolation period for Magee House individuals who have tested negative throughout the process could end Saturday. Meanwhile, the isolation for residents and staff of UNB's Elizabeth Parr-Johnston residence could be lifted as early as Wednesday, depending on the results of retests taking place Monday, said Public Health. So far, all test results have been negative. George Street Middle School reopens George Street Middle School in Fredericton reopened Monday, six days after students, staff and their families were urged by Public Health to self-isolate last week following a confirmed case of COVID-19. In a letter to parents on Sunday, Public Health said students and staff can return to school, and their families can return to work, with the exception of those who have been told by Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days. New Brunswick Public Health confirmed a case of COVID-19 at George Street Middle School in Fredericton last week.(Elizabeth Fraser/CBC) ""Custodial services have been through the school disinfecting high touch areas,"" said Dr. Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. ""Everyone who has not been identified as a close contact should feel confident to return to normal activities."" The George Street and UNB cases are linked, Public Health said earlier. Voting in self-isolation Elections New Brunswick is encouraging people who are under COVID-19 isolation and haven't voted in the May 10 municipal election yet but wish to do so to contact their local returning office to find out what options are available. With election day less than a week away, the options available are starting to decrease, said Kim Poffenroth, municipal election officer. Municipal election officer Kim Poffenroth asks everyone to be patient as election officials, who are all temporary workers hired for just a few days of work, do their best to deliver these elections during the 'unusual and challenging circumstances of this pandemic.'(Screenshot/ParlVu) ""Our municipal returning officers will gladly work with these individuals to determine the best way to arrange for them to vote, based on their current situation,"" she said in a statement.

Goldfarb', 'Deputy Business Editor']",Obama ‘frustrated’ by Russia’s decision to grant Snowden asylum,"Despite this, Obama confirmed he would attend the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg in September.

""There are times when they slip back into Cold War thinking and Cold War mentality,” Obama said on air Tuesday evening. “What I continually say to them and to President Putin, that’s the past.""

Obama last saw Putin at the G-8 summit earlier this summer in northern Ireland. The two leaders held a joint press conference, an experience that resulted in Putin ""not looking too excited."" said Obama.

Obama was interviewed by Leno during a stop in Los Angeles after the president attended a housing event in Phoenix Tuesday. He is set to travel to Camp Pendleton for a speech to troops Wednesday before returning to Washington.

He supported the NSA’s surveillance efforts, calling them a “critical component to counterterrorism"" even while he acknowledged they have ""raised a lot of questions for people.""

""We don’t have a domestic spying program,” Obama said. “What we do have is some mechanisms that can track a phone number or an e-mail address that is connected to a terrorist attack. That information is useful.""

Obama wouldn’t say what he would call Snowden – who has been labeled a hero and a traitor by different parties. The U.S. government has accused of him being a criminal.

""We don’t know exactly what he did, except what he said on the Internet and it's important for me not to judge,” Obama told Leno.

Obama said he asked his staff to look at ways to reduce the number of contractors in national security; Snowden worked for contractor Booz Allen Hamilton.

Obama defended recent decisions to shutter U.S. embassies in the Middle East and North Africa and to issue a global travel alert. Americans, he said, should still take vacation in a “prudent way” by reviewing State Department guidance on the Web.

""The odds of dying in a terrorist attack are a lot lower than they are of dying in a car accident, unfortunately,” Obama said. ""The general rule is just show some common sense and some caution.""

Earlier Tuesday aboard Air Force One, White House press secretary Jay Carney said that the president's appearance on the Tonight Show was meant to ""communicate with Americans where they are."" In contrast to the usual back-and-forth between the administration and more traditional press, Carney acknowledged that ""viewers of late-night shows are not necessarily the readers of newspapers or wire services, or necessarily viewers of cable or broadcast news shows."""

Here are the key dates:

March 8: US flies B-52 bombers over South Korea

The Cold War-era bombers flew out of Andersen Air Force Base in Guam as part of what the U.S. Pacific Command called a routine mission to highlight a ""continuous bomber presence"" in the region. A second fly-over was planned for March 26.

The exercise -- the 2nd in a month -- was a routine mission meant to ""reiterate the U.S. commitment to the security of our allies and partners,"" according to the Pentagon.

March 28: US flies nuclear-capable B-2 Spirit bombers over South Korea

The stealth bombers flew from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to drop inert munitions as part of annual joint US-South Korea military exercises. The US military said the mission demonstrated ""the United States' ability to conduct long range, precision strikes quickly and at will.""

Gordon'],Report Details Mistakes Made by U.S. in Improvement Projects for Iraq,"WASHINGTON — Before he left his Pentagon post, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta concluded that the inability of the Obama administration to complete an agreement providing for an American military presence in Iraq after 2011 had deprived the United States of important political leverage in Iraq.

When the United States had troops in Iraq, the former defense secretary explained, the American commander and the ambassador in Baghdad “created a strong force” that could often dissuade the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, from making “bad decisions” and “going off a cliff.”

But the withdrawal of the last complement of American forces in December 2011 reduced the ability of the United States to shape events there, he said.

Mr. Panetta’s views are contained in a report by Stuart W. Bowen Jr., the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. The post was established by Congress more than eight years ago, and the 171-page assessment on “Learning From Iraq” is its final major report. Much of the study, which is to be released Wednesday, covers the more than $60 billion in American aid that was used to carry out projects in Iraq."

Today the Senate was successful in stripping this provision out of the CR.

According to Sen Brian Schatz (D-HI)



""The Monsanto Protection Act is bad policy for the country and the State of Hawai‘i. The Senate version of the Continuing Resolution does not include this provision, effectively repealing the Monsanto Protection Act. This provision took the ability of the Secretary of Agriculture to fully exercise his regulatory power over GMOs, and compromised the role of our courts as a check on the legislative and executive systems, making it significantly more difficult for concerned citizens to present their case. I strongly urge the House not to sneak the Monsanto Protection Act back into the final version of the appropriations bill. However, if it is slipped back in, rather than letting the issue be deliberated with full transparency and public input, I will immediately introduce legislation to repeal it.""

Stripping the Monsanto Protection Act is a victory for American consumers and family farm agriculture. Corporate giveaways have no business in a bill to fund the government, and I’m pleased that the Senate stood up for accountability and transparency and against special interests. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Schatz to make sure that this damaging provision never again makes it into law.""

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), a farmer himself said:Hawai'i has been called ""ground zero"" for GMO/Agricultural Chemicals development. Its mild climate allows two growing seasons and its small legislature is easily bought out. In fact only 10 members of the Hawai'i legislature arerecipients of GMO/Chem money.

The GMO seed companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, and Dupont are the biggest agricultural chemical manufacturers. Their controversial claims of GMO seeds cutting down on pesticides are exactly opposite of reality. According to Organic Consumers herbicides account for about one-third of the global pesticide market, and around 80% of GM seeds involve herbicide-resistance.

Agriculture chemicals have poisoned aquifers on Oahu and Maui.

Kaua'i now has a bill pending that would require companies like Syngenta to disclose what pesticides they are spraying. Kaua'i residents are concerned not only with existing EPA registered pesticides but the experiments with the unregistered pesticides these GMO companies are developing.

So it is no surprise that popular and progressive Sen Brian Schatz responded to his many constituent calls and helped kill the Monsanto Protection Rider.

However.

Sen Schatz is being primaried by a New Democrat Coalition corporatist, Colleen Hanabusa. She has been conspicuously quiet on the subject of the Monsanto Rider.

No wonder. Her group, the New Dems, sees biotech as the ""future of the U.S."" They successfully pushed to extend patents and give corporate welfare to biotech companies.

""New Democrats believe the federal government can promote advances in biotechnology by providing funding for basic research, ensuring the protection of intellectual property and investing in regulatory agencies such as the Patent and Trademark Office and the Federal Drug Administration. ""

Hanabusa is quoted in the latest New Dem press release urging Congress to put partisanship aside. But according to the New Dems, that means embracing the odious Simpson-Bowles recommendations that balance the budget on the backs of the poor and elderly by cutting Social Security and other safety nets.

Not one word about the New Dems' support of corporate welfare and eternal war.

Sen. Schatz kept his constituents updated on the Monsanto Rider and his (successful) efforts to remove it as well as the nonsensical provision to defund the Affordable Care Act. We heard about defunding the ACA many times from Hanabusa (always in conjunction with increasingly desperate pleas for donations) but not one word on the Monsanto Rider.

So Rep Hanabusa: Where do you stand on special deals for biotech companies? With your New Dem pals or with the people of Hawai'i?"

USA TODAY

The White House has opposed the strengthening of sanctions

Senators want to up the sanctions to force Iran to compromise

Iran says its offer to limit some nuclear activities has been accepted by world powers in Geneva, who have offered to relax crippling economic sanctions in return.

""Today, they clearly said that they accept the proposed framework by Iran,"" Abbas Araghchi, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, told Iranian state TV, according to the Associated Press.

Araghchi did not provide details of Iran's proposal, and said he expects an agreement on the details Friday. The Iranian announcement came as the chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee said all options were still being reviewed.

Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., said he plans to decide on whether to move forward on a new Iran sanctions bill until after the talks in Geneva are over and he's heard their result.

As Johnson made that statement, word emerged that Secretary of State John Kerry will make an unexpected trip to Geneva on Friday. While there, he will meet with Iran foreign minister Javad Zarif.

The White House has opposed the strengthening of sanctions because it says the move may hurt chances of getting the Iranians to negotiate an end to the standoff. But supporters such as Johnson say that is the opposite of what will happen. They say increased sanctions will make the Iranians realize they must compromise or suffer economically.

U.S. negotiators in Geneva for the talks said they would offer Iran sanctions relief if the Islamic Republic stops expanding its nuclear program as talks continue for several months on a comprehensive solution to its nuclear standoff with world powers.

The Obama administration said before talks resumed Thursday it would ease sanctions on Iran in a way it says would be easily reversible.

In return, Iran would have to agree to limit the level to which it enriches uranium, its stockpiles of nuclear fuel, the capacity of its nuclear facilities and allow foreign inspectors to verify it is keeping its word, according to the White House.

U.S. negotiators, led by Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, will meet again Friday with Iran, together with negotiators from the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday such an interim deal would allow Iran to retain the ability to build nuclear weapons and should be rejected.

""Israel is completely opposed to these proposals,"" Netanyahu said in Jerusalem, according to the Jerusalem Post. ""I believe that adopting them would be a mistake of historic proportions and they should be completely rejected.""

Iran says its nuclear program is aimed at research and producing medical isotopes, and is allowed under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed. The USA and its allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere say Iran is developing a nuclear weapons program.

Both the USA and Israel have said they will use military force if negotiations fail to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

Netanyahu reminded U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who is visiting Israel, the West Bank and Jordan this week, of ""Death to America"" chants in Tehran on Monday, when the 34th anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis was celebrated.

""I believe that that is the real face of the regime. A regime like that cannot be allowed to have the most dangerous weapon in the world,"" Netanyahu said, according to Israel Hayom newspaper.

An interim deal has been on the table for years as a way to keep the talks moving toward an eventual settlement, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security.

""Some of the European partners are afraid that if this doesn't work, the next step is the military option,"" said Albright, a former inspector with the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Europeans ""are more comfortable with this approach of an interim deal first and preserve the possibility to negotiate.""

Any final deal, however, would have to lengthen Iran's ""breakout time,"" Albright said, referring to the time Iran would need to secretly produce enough uranium for a bomb, if it made a decision to do so.

He said Iran would have to agree to several steps that would assure the international community:

• Reduce its uranium centrifuges from 19,000 to 9,000, or fewer if counting more advanced centrifuges that have been installed but not turned on, and disable its heavy water reactor under construction in Arak.

• Reduce Iranian stockpiles of uranium enriched to 20% purity that can easily be converted into weapons-grade uranium that is 90% pure.

• Provide U.N. inspectors access to now-secret plants where centrifuges are produced, and other monitoring that would help international monitors' detect secret centrifuge sites."

As 2013 ends, President Obama has lost credibility with many people who trusted him at the start of the year. Thanks to the Healthcare.gov debacle, polls find support for the president among women and independents has dropped to the lowest ebb of his presidency. Obama's words -- promising Americans they could keep their doctors under his health care plan -- didn’t match his deeds.

Surprisingly, the same thing is happening on the other side of the world among Arabs in the Middle East and for the same reason.

Too often, Obama’s speeches and actions don’t match.

""We are glad the Americans are here,"" said Ahmed al-Ibrahim, an adviser to some of Saudi Arabia's royals and officials, when I met with him recently, ""but we fear that the president has lost credibility after Syria.""

More On This...

[pullquote]

The Saudi official is referring to Obama’s “red line” vow of military action if the Syrian dictator Bashir Assad used chemical weapons against his own people. Assad did and Obama didn’t. Saudi officials were stunned.

Next came the revelation earlier this year that Obama was secretly negotiating with Iran, the mortal enemy of both Israel and Saudi Arabia. Officials in both nations have told me that they simply don't believe that the president can sweet-talk the mullahs out of the weapons they have coveted for years.

“The bond of trust between America and Saudi Arabia has been broken in the Obama years,"" al-Ibrahim said. ""We feel we have been stabbed in the back by Obama.""

""Every time that Obama had to choose between his enemies and his friends, he always chose his enemies,"" he said. ""We don't know what he's putting in his tea.""

Al-Ibrahim also pointed to Obama's “dangerous inaction” during violent Iran-backed uprisings in Bahrain, and now his negotiations with Iran, and his separate, secret negotiations with Iran's terrorist proxy Hezbollah. Since American officials cannot legally negotiate with terrorist groups and Hezbollah is a State Department-listed terror organization, the administration has been using British diplomats to carry messages to Hezbollah. The Obama administration reportedly favors a ""warm up to a direct relationship in the future"" with Hezbollah.

Obama is sending conflicting messages. In Washington, the president says negotiations are all we need to meet the Iranian threat. He issued a rare veto threat to try to halt tougher sanctions against Iran.

At the same time, in the Middle East, the president has dispatched more than 40 U.S. Navy vessels (including a carrier-strike group) and sent his secretary of defense to detail America's vast military assets in the region.

Speaking to Arab defense ministers, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel itemized America's military commitment to immediately respond to Iranian aggression:

• More than 35,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines in the theater;

• Even after exiting Iraq, the U.S. Army maintains more than 10,000 forward-deployed soldiers as well as tanks, artillery, and attack helicopters;

• America's most advanced fighter jets, including F-22s, are deployed less than an hour's flight time from Iran;

• American surveillance aircraft, ground listening stations, satellites, and sea patrols continue to scan for threats across the region;

• America's missile defense systems--on ground, sea, and air--remain on high alert. That includes the U.S. Navy's ballistic missile defense ships, Patriot missile batteries, and phased-array radars.

“The Department of Defense will work with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on better integration of its members’ missile defense capabilities. The United States continues to believe that a multilateral framework is the best way to develop interoperable and integrated regional missile defense. Such defenses are the best way to deter and, if necessary, defeat coercion and aggression,"" Hagel told the Gulf News on Dec.18.

With little fanfare, Obama has also quietly lifted the ban on selling sensitive missile-defense technology to Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies living within reach of Iran's new Shahab-3 missiles. The Shahab-3's range is 1,242 miles--placing Israel and most of America's Arab allies within striking distance.

However, Obama's quiet efforts to provide new missile defenses and renewed security guarantees may be too little, too late.

The Saudis are now seeking their own military arrangements because they no longer trust the U.S. The GCC, a regional alliance of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, recently announced the creation of a joint military force based in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

“There will be a unified command of around 100,000 members, God willing,” Prince Miteb bin Abdullah told reporters. This new force represents a massive expansion of the 30,000-strong Peninsula Shield force.

""We no longer believe that America alone can safeguard our freedom from Iranian aggression,"" said al-Ibrahim, ""that's why we are expanding our forces and integrating our missile defenses with our neighbors.""

He added, ""the world should understand that the GCC will not stay quiet and leave our member-states vulnerable to bad actors and bad deals in the region. It is our duty to protect our region.""

And now, astonished Saudi officials are contrasting Obama's quick actions last weekend in South Sudan with his unwillingness to act in places like Syria or in Bahrain where thousands of U.S. troops and the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet are based.

""The president has shown that he can take action when he chooses to. He chose not to act after the chemical weapons attacks in Syria, but as soon as things started to go wrong in South Sudan, Obama jumped on it,"" said al-Ibrahim.

On Saturday, Obama dispatched three CV-22 Osprey aircraft, the sort that can fly like an airplane and an helicopter, to South Sudan to evacuate Americans caught in ongoing violence in the city of Bor. The aircraft came under small arms fire and were forced to retreat as they attempted to land. Four U.S. service members were injured in the attempted evacuation. American citizens were rescued successfully on Sunday using civilian and U.N. helicopters.

In his June 4, 2009 Cairo speech, the first American president raised in a Muslim land came to offer a bold promise: ""I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect."" Four and a half years later, Arab leaders like al-Ibrahim say that ""mutual interest"" is sundered and ""mutual respect"" squandered.



If the Saudi exasperation sounds familiar, it is because it is the same tone you hear in Tel Aviv and in Washington."

Pollack'],"Short of a Deal, Containing Iran Is the Best Option - The New York Times","WASHINGTON — THIS week, Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, will address the United Nations General Assembly. His message is likely to be a sharp change from the adolescent belligerence of his hard-line predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mr. Rouhani is a genuine reformer — but his desire to move Iran in a new direction should not blind the United States to the difficulties of achieving a diplomatic solution.

Mr. Rouhani has hinted that he is willing to compromise on aspects of Iran’s nuclear program for the sake of repairing relations with the rest of the world and having economic sanctions on Iran removed. But he has also warned that he cannot hold off his hard-line rivals forever, and it is unclear whether the Iranians will be willing to make the kind of concessions that America and its allies want. Ultimately, it is the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, not Mr. Rouhani, who would make the final decision on a deal. He has shown little inclination for one, although recent statements from the leadership offer hope that their position may be softening.

If it cannot reach a diplomatic deal, America will face a choice between two alternatives: using force to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear arsenal or containing a nuclear Iran until its regime collapses from its own dysfunction.

It is going to be a difficult choice. For that reason, we need to start thinking about it now. We cannot afford to have our diplomatic efforts collapse suddenly and, as in Syria, be forced to lunge forward unprepared."

Russia%2C U.S. have been at odds over Syria%2C Snowden and other issues

Obama canceled a meeting with Putin in Moscow%3B their personal relationship continues to deteriorate

G-20 summit officially focuses on economic matters%2C but Obama will also try to rally support for Syria strike

WASHINGTON — With the U.S.-Russia relationship already strained, President Obama's decision to delay a possible military strike against Syria adds an unexpected twist to what was already shaping up to be an awkward G-20 summit hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin this week in St. Petersburg.

Obama leaves Tuesday for Sweden, a stop added to his itinerary after he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Putin in Moscow ahead of the G-20, which begins Thursday.

The U.S. and Russia have long been at odds over the conflict in Syria as Russia, the only major patron of Syrian President Bashar Assad, has blocked any possibility of the United Nations Security Council mandating action against him in the 2½-year-old civil war.

Russia's blocking of the United Nations on Syria, along with the decision to grant former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden temporary asylum and a lack of recent progress between the two countries on other issues, led Obama last month to cancel the long-anticipated Moscow visit.

Obama announced over the weekend that he wants to take military action against the Assad regime in response to an alleged chemical attack Aug. 21, but first he wants congressional authorization. The G-20 meeting will offer him what is likely his last chance to muster international support from leaders of member countries for a potential strike, and the four-day overseas trip will come after a several-days-long blitz by Obama to persuade skeptical lawmakers at home to give him congressional authority to carry out a strike against Syria.

He called several lawmakers, who are away from Washington for their summer recess, over the weekend to make his case. And Obama met with Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., at the White House on Monday. He's also scheduled to meet with the 12 top-ranking lawmakers representing congressional national security committees on Tuesday.

Secretary of State John Kerry and others on Obama's national security team will continue the White House's lobbying efforts while the president is away. Canceling his trip to Sweden and St. Petersburg was not considered, according to a White House official who was not authorized to comment and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Officially, the G-20 summit's focus is geared toward talks on a slew of global economic issues important to member countries. But Obama is likely to use sideline meetings with leaders to try to build a broader political coalition of countries willing to support U.S. military action in Syria, even if they aren't contributing militarily.

The White House says there are no plans for a one-on-one meeting between Obama and Putin on the sidelines of the summit, but the two will inevitably have some interaction during the course of the meetings.

In the days since Obama announced his desire to take military action against Syria, the chasm between the United States and Russia — at least rhetorically — has widened.

Over the weekend, the Obama administration and Putin traded barbs after Obama declared he wants to carry out a military strike.

Putin called it ""nonsense"" that Assad would authorize a chemical attack and urged Obama to consider whether a strike would have any impact to end the internecine violence or be worth the civilian casualties an American strike potentially could cost.

Secretary of State John Kerry expressed frustration that the Russians have turned a blind eye to evidence the United States has provided to demonstrate that the Syrian regime was responsible for chemical attacks against Syrian opposition this year, first confirmed by the U.S. intelligence community in June.

""They chose – I literally mean chose – not to believe it or to at least acknowledge publicly. I think this evidence is going to be overwhelming,"" Kerry said in an interview on ABC's This Week. ""If the president of Russia chooses yet again to ignore it, that's his choice.""

For the past two years, the Obama-Putin relationship has been ""like watching a slow-moving train wreck,"" says Andrew Kuchins, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

The two leaders held glum expressions when they appeared for the cameras after their last meeting, the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland in June.

Last month, Obama described Putin as looking like the ""bored kid in the back of the classroom"" while acknowledging that the two have differences of opinion on some matters ""and we're not going to be able to completely disguise them.""

In perhaps Obama's most stinging rebuke, which came in a recent interview with The Tonight Show's Jay Leno, Obama lamented that Putin had a ""Cold War mentality.""

""One thing is clear to me, that this is the worst personal relationship between U.S. and Russian — perhaps even U.S. and Soviet — leaders in history,"" Kuchins said.

Despite the differences, Kerry said that the administration is looking at ways to internationalize efforts to secure Syria's chemical weapons cache and that he hopes Russia could play a role in that effort.

Though the relationship is undergoing particular strain because of differences on the Syria crisis and Russia granting asylum to Snowden, the White House notes that cooperation with Russia has not halted.

In recent weeks, Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel held meetings in Washington with their Russian counterparts, and the two countries have held high-level meetings on the sticky issue of missile defense.

By delaying any military action until he has congressional approval, Obama has avoided having to defend the aftermath of a strike in a summit setting, notes Angela Stent, a Russia analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

""Syria might still come up, but it won't dominate the G-20 agenda as it might have had there been a military strike,"" Stent said."

""In the case of Syria, the chemical attack is a pretext... The Americans try to play with words and pretend that they've become involved in this case for humanitarian aims,"" Khamenei told a meeting of the Assembly of Experts, a state body.

""I believe the Americans are making mistakes in Syria and they have felt the impact and will certainly suffer loss,"" he said in the speech, whose text was published on his official website.

Khamenei's words indicate no let-up in Iran's considerable support for Syrian President Bashar al Assad, its closest ally who stands accused by Western powers of launching poison gas into an embattled suburb of Damascus on Aug. 21. Around 1,400 people were killed, according to U.S. officials.

On Wednesday, the head of Iran's elite Quds force, Qassem Soleimani, told the Assembly of Experts that the Islamic Republic would ""support Syria to the end"", according to the Fars news agency.

But Iran's response to the chemical attack in recent days hints at disagreement within the corridors of power.

In contrast to military commanders, the government of President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, has condemned the use of chemical weapons and warned against military strikes in Syria, but not apportioned blame for the attack.

Assad's government has denied responsibility, blaming what it calls a provocation by Syrian rebel forces aimed at provoking foreign military intervention on their side in the two-and-a-half-year-old conflict.

Despite unexpected progress in last week’s nuclear talks, U.S. and European governments face a difficult path to a possible deal with Iran, U.S. officials and experts warn, as politics and a deep-seated mistrust on both sides threaten to scuttle even the modest gains made so far.

Only days after negotiations that Iran hailed as a possible “turning point” in the nuclear crisis, diplomats and analysts offered a sober assessment of the obstacles to a genuine breakthrough, including factional fighting inside Iran over whether to agree to limits on Iran’s nuclear program.

New evidence of the internal debate surfaced Friday when Iranian leaders issued conflicting statements about the negotiations and whether Iran should ever accede to nuclear restrictions. A powerful conservative cleric staunchly defended Iran’s “inalienable right” to nuclear energy during Friday prayer services in Tehran, saying no country could dictate the amount or types of enriched uranium Iran produced.

“Any proposal which denies the people their rights is dismissed by the nation, and no official has the right to compromise in this regard,” said Hojjatoleslam Kazem Seddiqi, a senior cleric who is considered close to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s supreme leader.

Negotiators from Iran and six world powers met for two days in Almaty, Kazakhstan, last week in the first direct talks on Iran’s nuclear program in eight months. The negotiations, which began amid low expectations, ended Wednesday with an agreement to expand the talks in the coming weeks to include technical consultations and another round of formal negotiations in April.

Herwig Prammer/Reuters Wait 1 second to continue.

The six-nation bloc — the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — attempted to break a months-long impasse with a new proposal that offered Iran partial relief from economic sanctions while showing new flexibility on demands that Iran restrict parts of its nuclear program.

The proposals drew a favorable response from Iranian diplomats in Almaty and from other prominent officials immediately after the talks adjourned. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, an MIT-trained engineer widely regarded as a moderate, said the nuclear negotiations were “on the right track and moving in the right direction.”

“Our case is neither like North Korea’s nor Libya’s,” Salehi said in an interview broadcast in Iran on Friday evening. “It will be resolved. . . . We have nothing to hide and we have always been clean.”

Obama administration officials on Friday continued to applaud Almaty’s surprising, if modest, turnaround, with one senior official calling the talks “constructive.”

“I don’t want to overpromise, but we’re encouraged,” said the official, speaking to reporters accompanying Secretary of State John F. Kerry during a visit to Europe. “Our people who were there felt the sanctions have gotten Iran’s attention,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe diplomatically sensitive negotiations.

U.S. officials also said that Iran has not formally responded to the Almaty proposal or agreed to shut down a single centrifuge. Current and former administration officials cited a decade-long history of disappointments and setbacks in previous efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran.

“Iran has a long track record for feints, misdirection and failure to deliver,” said Clifford Kupchan, a former State Department official and Middle East analyst for the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm.

Most recently, Iran made a diplomatic about-face in the summer after appearing to agree to a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Officials for the U.N. nuclear watchdog announced in June that Iran had decided to allow access to military facilities where its scientists are suspected of having conducted secret nuclear research. But before the negotiators could work out details, the Iranians changed their minds.

Such episodes have fueled suspicions that Iran is using diplomacy as a stalling tactic. Conservative U.S. lawmakers and think tanks already have begun criticizing the proposed concessions that negotiators offered in Almaty, arguing that it’s too early to talk about easing the pressure of sanctions on Iran.

Of particular concern to administration critics is a reported offer to lift sanctions that prohibit Iran from exchanging its oil for gold and other precious metals. Iran already faces massive restrictions on oil sales, including a boycott on oil imports to Europe. U.S. officials declined to discuss details of the confidential proposal.

“Allowing Iran to resume trade in gold would drive a significant hole through our financial sanctions and undermine our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability,” Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said in a statement.

Other analysts argued that concessions were necessary for any chance of diplomatic success.

“The arguments being made are politically convenient, but they simply are not realistic,” said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “Everyone should be wanting tangible results instead of holding on to positions that won’t get us any closer to eliminating the most important proliferation risks.”

http://money.cnn.com/2013/02/19/technology/china-military-cybercrime/index.html,2013-02-19 00:00:00,['Charles Riley'],Report: Chinese military engaged in 'extensive cyber espionage campaign',"An American cybersecurity firm has linked one of the world's most prolific groups of computer hackers to the Chinese government, saying in a new report that an extensive cyber-espionage campaign is being waged from a location near Shanghai.

The security firm, Mandiant, detailed the allegations in a 60-page report published Tuesday that describes the group's tactics over a six-year period.

The Virginia-based Mandiant, which helps companies detect and respond to cyber threats, said it has observed the group of hackers -- called the ""comment crew"" -- systematically steal hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations across 20 industries worldwide since 2006.

Mandiant claims the activity can be traced to four networks near Shanghai -- with some operations taking place in a location that is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, a secret division of China's military.

""The sheer scale and duration of sustained attacks against such a wide set of industries from a singularly identified group based in China leaves little doubt about the organization behind [the group],"" Mandiant said. ""We believe the totality of the evidence we provide in this document bolsters the claim that [the group] is Unit 61398.""

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei dismissed the hacking charges on Tuesday, insisting that China is the victim of many cyberattacks -- most originating in the United States.

""Making baseless accusations based on premature analysis is irresponsible and unprofessional,"" he said. ""China resolutely opposes any form of hacking activities.""

Last month, the Chinese defense ministry said the country's military ""has never supported any hacker activities.""

The latest accusation against Beijing comes amid concerns about the breadth and depth of cyberattacks originating in China. Recently, several leading U.S. news organizations reported their computer systems had been attacked by China-based hackers.

Mandiant estimates that hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people work within Unit 61398, which is housed in a 12-story, 130,663 square-foot facility.

Organizations in English-speaking countries are the primary victims of the comment crew -- making up 87% of the 141 attacks observed by Mandiant. Of that, 115 attacks targeted organizations in the United States.

The hackers have a ""well-defined attack methodology,"" and Mandiant said the group has stolen large volumes of intellectual property, including technology blueprints, proprietary manufacturing processes and business plans.

The report did not list companies or agencies that have been attacked, but the comment crew is known to have attacked Coca-Cola, security firm RSA, and consultancy Chertoff Group.

The Coca-Cola (CCE) hack occurred in 2009 when the beverage giant was trying to purchase China's Huiyuan Juice Group. According to reports, comment crew stole Coca-Cola's negotiation strategy along with other information about the proposed offer. The deal was scuttled just days after the hack, when the Chinese government said it could not accept the deal on antitrust grounds.

RSA was attacked by the group in 2011, which compromised the security of some of its SecurID tokens used to gain entry into corporate systems. Using information gained from the RSA hack, the group subsequently attacked aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin (LMT).

All of these attacks started the same way: via a cleverly worded emails -- written in perfect English -- that appeared to be from someone inside the company. Instead, it contained malicious software designed to gain access to the corporations networks.

Mandiant was able to pinpoint the identities of three individuals working with the group. The report identifies the hackers who use the monikers ""Ugly Gorilla,"" ""dota"" and ""SuperHard."" It tracks their activities in an unusually detailed manner, including information on their e-mail accounts, cell phones and hacking techniques.

Government and intelligence officials in the United States are increasingly concerned about the threats posed by cybercrime, especially from government actors.

Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said last year that a cyberattack could be crippling, citing risks to the power grid, Wall Street and the financial system.

""We are literally getting hundreds of thousands of attacks everyday that try to exploit information in various agencies and departments and frankly throughout this country,"" Panetta said.

In a statement, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said the administration is aware of the Mandiant report, and is acting to negate these threats.

""The United States has substantial and growing concerns about the threats to U.S. economic and national security posed by cyber intrusions,"" Vietor said. ""We have repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials, including in the military, and we will continue to do so.""

Earlier this month, President Obama signed an executive order designed to address the country's most basic cybersecurity needs -- and highlighted the effort in his State of the Union address.

The order will make it easier for private companies in control of the nation's critical infrastructure to share information about cyberattacks with the government. The order also directs the government to work with the private sector on standards that will help protect companies from cybercrime.

In recent weeks, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal have disclosed that their computer networks had been targeted by hackers in China.

The New York Times, which hired Mandiant to help mitigate the threat, reported Tuesday that the comment crew was not the source of the attack on its network.

China is not the only country believed to be involved in cyberattacks. The existence of several other state-sponsored cyberweapons have also been reported in recent years, with names like Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame. The U.S. government is widely believed to have played a role in developing some of those viruses, with an eye toward containing Iran."

The sources said one of the suspects was believed to be a courier for the Al Qaeda network, and the other a bodyguard in Afghanistan prior to the 2001 terror attacks.

The direct ties to the Al Qaeda senior leadership undercut early characterizations by the Obama administration that the attackers in Benghazi were isolated “extremists"" -- not Al Qaeda terrorists -- with no organizational structure or affiliation.

The head of the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who receives regular intelligence briefings and whose staffers continue to investigate the Benghazi terrorist attack, would not discuss specific suspects or their backgrounds.

But he said the ties to Al Qaeda senior leadership, also known as Al Qaeda core, are now established.

More On This...

“It is accurate that of the group being targeted by the bureau, at this point, there’s strong Al Qaeda ties,” Rogers told Fox News. ""You can still be considered to have strong ties because you are in the ring of operations of Al Qaeda core. ... There are individuals that certainly fit that definition.""

Counterterrorism expert Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News that investigators are finding ""more and more ties -- not just to Al Qaeda's branch in North Africa ... but Al Qaeda senior leadership in Pakistan.""

A year ago, Fox News' Bret Baier was first to report that a former Guantanamo detainee, Sufian bin Qumu, was suspected of training jihadists in eastern Libya for the attack.

Now, sources tell Fox News that Benghazi suspect Faraj al Chalabi, also a Libyan national whose ties to Usama bin Laden date back to 1998, is believed to be a former bodyguard who was with the Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan in 2001.

After the Benghazi attack, al Chalabi fled to Pakistan where reports suggest he was held, then later returned to Libyan custody and eventually released. He was first publicly identified as a suspected terrorist in 1998 by the regime of former Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi for his alleged role in the murder of a German intelligence official, Silvan Becker and his wife. An Interpol arrest warrant in March 1998 named al Chalabi, two other Libyans and bin Laden as the likely perpetrators.

“Our sources say al Chalabi is suspected of bringing materials from the compound to Benghazi to Al Qaeda senior leadership in Pakistan. It's not clear what those materials consisted of but he is known to have gone back to Pakistan immediately after the attack,” Joscelyn said.

Separately, and for the first time, Rogers laid out a timeline for the attack which suggests significant advance planning. According to the congressman, there was an “aspirational phase” several months out, where the idea of an attack was thrown around, followed by “weeks” of operational planning, and then the ramp up to the Sept. 11 assault which lasted up to several days. This assessment is in stark contrast to initial administration statements that the attack was “spontaneous” and achieved with little planning.

“I believe that they had an operational phase that lasted at least a couple of weeks, maybe even longer. And then an initiation phase that lasted a couple or three days prior to the event itself. And so this notion that they just showed up and decided this was a spontaneous act does not comport with the information at least with what we have seen in the intelligence community,” Rogers told Fox News.

Some counterterrorism analysts concur with Roger’s assessment, describing the mortars used to strike the CIA annex in the second wave of the attack as ""smoking gun"" evidence -- as mortars require skill to fire, and typically must be pre-positioned to ensure accuracy. On Sept. 11, two mortars struck the CIA annex, killing former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.

The opposing analysis is that the mortars were set in the early morning hours of Sept. 11, and that the terrorists did not bring equipment with them that suggests significant planning.

Fox News contacted the FBI which is in the lead on the Benghazi investigation, as well as the CIA and the National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC. Both the NCTC and the CIA declined to comment. There was no immediate response from the FBI."

President Obama is weighing a military strike against Syria that would be of limited scope and duration, designed to serve as punishment for Syria’s use of chemical weapons and as a deterrent, while keeping the United States out of deeper involvement in that country’s civil war, according to senior administration officials.

The timing of such an attack, which would probably last no more than two days and involve sea-launched cruise missiles — or, possibly, long-range bombers — striking military targets not directly related to Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal, would be dependent on three factors: completion of an intelligence report assessing Syrian government culpability in last week’s alleged chemical attack; ongoing consultation with allies and Congress; and determination of a justification under international law.

“We’re actively looking at the various legal angles that would inform a decision,” said an official who spoke about the presidential deliberations on the condition of anonymity. Missile-armed U.S. warships are already positioned in the Mediterranean.

As the administration moved rapidly toward a decision, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said the use of chemical weapons in an attack Wednesday against opposition strongholds on the outskirts of Damascus is now “undeniable.”

Evidence being gathered by United Nations experts in Syria was important, Kerry said, but not necessary to prove what is already “grounded in facts, informed by conscience and guided by common sense.”

The team of U.N. weapons investigators on Monday visited one of three rebel-held suburbs where the alleged attack took place, after first being forced to withdraw when their vehicles came under sniper fire. The Syrian government, which along with Russia has suggested that the rebels were responsible for the chemical attack, agreed to the U.N. inspection over the weekend.

Videos and statements by witnesses and relief organizations such as Doctors Without Borders have proved that an attack occurred, Kerry said. The U.S. intelligence report is to be released this week.

Among the factors, officials said, are that only the government is known to possess chemical weapons and the rockets to deliver them, and its continuing control of chemical stocks has been closely monitored by U.S. intelligence.

Kerry said Syrian forces had engaged in a “cynical attempt to cover up” their actions, not only by delaying the arrival of the U.N. team but by shelling the affected area continually. Any U.S. strike would probably await the departure of the U.N. inspectors from Syria.

Kerry’s statement, which he read to reporters in the State Department briefing room without taking questions, was part of an escalating administration drumbeat, which is likely to include a public statement by Obama in coming days. Officials said the public warnings are designed partly to wring any possible cooperation out of Russia — or an unlikely admission from the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad — before Obama makes his decision.

The administration decided to postpone a meeting with the Russians this week in The Hague to discuss a negotiated solution to the Syrian war, “given our ongoing consultations about the appropriate response to the chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21,” a State Department official said.

At the State Department, Kerry said, “Make no mistake: President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world’s most heinous weapons against the world’s most vulnerable people. Nothing today is more serious, and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny.”

He and other officials drew a sharp distinction between U.S. action related to a violation of international law by what they called Assad’s “massive” use of chemical weapons and any direct military involvement in the Syrian conflict, which is in its third year.

“What we are talking about here is a potential response . . . to this specific violation of international norms,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said. “While it is part of this ongoing Syrian conflict in which we have an interest and in which we have a clearly stated position, it is distinct in that regard.”

Obama and other officials have said repeatedly that no U.S. troops would be sent to Syria. But despite Obama’s year-old threat of an unspecified U.S. response if Assad crossed a “red line” by using chemical weapons, even a limited military engagement seemed unlikely before Wednesday’s attack near Damascus.

“This international norm cannot be violated without consequences,” Kerry said.

The options under consideration are neither new nor open-ended, officials said. The use of “limited stand-off strikes” has long been among the options the Pentagon has provided Obama. “Potential targets include high-value regime air defense, air, ground, missile, and naval forces as well as the supporting military facilities and command nodes,” Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a June letter to Congress. “Stand-off air and missile systems could be used to strike hundreds of targets at a tempo of our choosing.”

Although Dempsey, who has questioned the wisdom of direct military involvement in Syria, said that such an operation would require “hundreds” of ships and aircraft and potentially cost “in the billions,” the action that is being contemplated would be far smaller and designed more to send a message than to cripple Assad’s military and change the balance of forces on the ground. Syrian chemical weapons storage areas, which are numerous and widely dispersed, are seen as unlikely targets.

The language of international criminality has clearly resonated among U.S. allies and lawmakers.

“We will have to act,” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who has long opposed any U.S. intervention, including the administration’s decision this summer to send light arms to Syrian opposition forces. “I don’t think we can allow repeated use of chemical weapons now, an escalated use of chemical weapons, to stand.”

Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, emphasized that a U.S. strike should not be directed at altering the dynamic of Syria’s larger civil war.

“I think it should be surgical. It should be proportional. It should be in response to what’s happened with the chemicals,” Corker said in an NBC interview. “But the fact is, I don’t want us to get involved in such a way that we change that dynamic on the ground.” The senator said he thought the administration’s response to the attack was “imminent.”

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said he had been in touch with the White House. In a statement, Boehner echoed concerns expressed by lawmakers from both parties that the administration further consult Congress before taking action.

The administration has said that it will follow international law in shaping its response. Authorization for the use of force against another nation normally comes only from the U.N. Security Council — where Russia and China have vetoed previous resolutions against Assad — or in a NATO operation similar to the one launched in the former Yugoslavia in 1999, without a U.N. mandate.

But much of international law is untested, and administration lawyers are also examining possible legal justifications based on a violation of international prohibitions on chemical weapons use, or on an appeal for assistance from a neighboring nation such as Turkey.

Britain, France and Turkey have said that they would support action if the use of chemical weapons was confirmed, but a clear-cut case is also likely to make approval easier for allies such as Germany, which disagreed with NATO’s 2011 operation in Libya despite the existence of a U.N. resolution.

“The use of chemical weapons would be a crime against civilization,” German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Monday. “The international community must act should the use of such weapons be confirmed.”

Consultations on Syria have been ongoing at the ambassadorial level at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where a meeting is scheduled for Wednesday. The Arab League, which approved the Libya operation, is also due to meet this week to discuss Syria.

By Susan Cornwell

WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - When the Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda placed a bounty on her husband's head, Mary Feierstein learned of it from a friend who called and said, ""You must be a mess!""

U.S. Ambassador Gerald Feierstein was thousands of miles (km) away at the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, without his wife and family on what is called an ""unaccompanied"" posting.

He is one of more than a thousand U.S. diplomats on such tours of duty in danger spots around the world, part of a trend that is changing the definition of being a diplomat.

Over time, his wife has learned to stay calm when the phone rings unexpectedly at her home outside Washington. For nearly five years, she has not lived in the same country as her husband, a career diplomat who specializes in the Middle East and South Asia.

After militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Yemen last September, breaking through to the inner building and ripping plaques and lettering from the walls, Feierstein called his wife to tell her he was OK.

He had also called her a few years earlier when he was based in Islamabad, Pakistan, and a bomb went off near his residence. He was unhurt in that attack.

But when Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - considered by U.S. officials to be al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate - offered 3 kg of gold last December for the killing of Feierstein, it was Mary's turn to call her husband. He played down the danger.

""He said it was old news. They are constantly under threat, you know,"" Mary Feierstein said in her first media interview since the threat.

After a police officer came to her home to give her his card and tell her to call him if she needed any help, ""that's when I got scared,"" Feierstein said.

The new perils for foreign service officers were spotlighted last Sept. 11, when militants overran the temporary U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, killing four Americans, including Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Two other U.S. diplomats were killed in Afghanistan in the past year.

President Barack Obama, still grappling with controversy over the Benghazi attack, called on Congress on Friday to fully fund his $4 billion embassy security budget request.

In a memorial ceremony earlier this month at the State Department, Vice President Joe Biden said that diplomats ""take risks that sometimes exceed those of the women and men in uniform.""

Honored along with Stevens were Sean Patrick Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who died in Benghazi; and foreign service officers Anne Smedinghoff and Ragaei Said Abdelfattah, killed in Afghanistan in 2013 and 2012.

FIVE-FOLD INCREASE IN UNACCOMPANIED DIPLOMATS

The State Department says there are about 1,100 U.S. foreign service officers now at posts abroad where they are unaccompanied or there are limits on who can accompany them - usually meaning no children.

That is a five-fold increase in unaccompanied American diplomats over the past decade, and represents about 14 percent of U.S. foreign service officers serving overseas.

The change began with ""civilian surges"" into the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan to help with stabilization and reconstruction. Over 400 unaccompanied diplomats are in those countries.

Then, the Arab Spring uprisings starting in 2011 added many unstable countries to the list where the State Department did not want to send families.

The fluctuating list now includes Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Libya and Tunisia, as well as the new African state of South Sudan, the State Department said.

The U.S. embassies in Algeria, Sudan and Lebanon are in the ""limited accompanied"" category as is the U.S. Consulate in Mexico's third-largest city, Monterrey, a focal point for drug-related violence.

The risks to diplomats are not all external. A 2007 State Department survey said 17 percent of employees who had served in dangerous posts indicated some symptoms similar to those of post-traumatic stress disorder. The department, following the military's lead, has set up a program to help diagnose and treat PTSD in its employees.

Mary Feierstein realized she was one of an expanding group of left-behind relatives when she started attending the year-end holiday parties the State Department throws for them, and noticed the crowd getting bigger every year.

She also noticed a lot of small children at those parties, and admitted to thinking, ""At least my kids are grown."" Her children, two daughters and a son, are all in their 20s. Her son has served two tours of duty with the Marines in Iraq.

Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the holiday parties, at which some of the unaccompanied diplomats were Skyped in from abroad. Feierstein said she thought Obama should attend too.

The president did call Gerald Feierstein to thank him for his service after the Yemen embassy was attacked last Sept. 13, two days after the Benghazi assaults.

'NEW NORM'

The United States used to be quicker to evacuate its embassies and consulates when dangers arose, said Susan Johnson, president of the American Foreign Service Association, the official union representing the Foreign Service.

These days, Washington tries to manage risks by building up the physical security of posts and increasing diplomatic security personnel, she said.

""In the process, we seem to have built a new level of tolerance for the amount of risk our diplomats face,"" Johnson said, adding that unaccompanied tours were increasingly becoming ""a new norm.""

There is pressure on diplomats to do the dangerous tours in order to advance. It is perceived to be ""almost mandatory"" to serve at an unaccompanied post and ""punch that ticket"" during a Foreign Service career, she said.

The State Department said 20 percent of its current employees had served in Iraq, Afghanistan or Pakistan.

The department offers incentives such as danger pay and shorter tours. Unaccompanied posts can be just 12 months, with several breaks, and families can often be left behind at a previous post to minimize disruption.

The State Department has made considerable progress in supporting employees in unaccompanied posts, its inspector general said in a 2010 report. Still, it said, ""many returnees experience problems adjusting to their follow-on assignments,"" and more counseling services may be needed.

Mary Feierstein was born in Pakistan and met her husband on his first tour there in the 1970s. She said he was one of some ""really tough people"" that the State Department keeps cycling through stressful, dangerous posts.

Gerald Feierstein served in Lebanon unaccompanied in 2003 and 2004, then returned to Washington for a few years and was a senior official in the State Department's counterterrorism office.

He was sent to Pakistan for the third time in his career in 2008, as deputy chief of mission in Islamabad. His family stayed in the United States. In September 2010, Feierstein went to Yemen, again without his family.

""We were planning to go later. ... After the Arab Spring, we haven't been able to go there at all,"" Mary Feierstein said.

At home, she volunteers for the local Democratic Party and supports causes like gun control. She last saw her husband in March.

While tired of the separation, she said she felt sorrier for her children, even though they are grown. ""They miss him so much. They are so happy when he comes home."" (Editing by Warren Strobel and Peter Cooney)"

He served as President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff from 1998 to 2001.

From Attorney General Eric Holder’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, we learned that the Obama administration is “struggling” with how to provide more information on its so-called targeted killing program; that senior officials have “talked about a greater need for transparency” about the program; and that we “will hear the president speak about this” in the future. After a limited document review by the Senate intelligence committee; a spirited 13-hour filibuster led by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.); and a last-minute admission by Holder that the president does not have the authority to use drones to kill a U.S. citizen on American soil who is not engaged in combat, the White House is still bobbing and weaving on whether to share with Congress the legal opinions and memorandums governing targeted killing, which include the legal justification for killing U.S. citizens without trial.

The Obama administration is wrong to withhold these documents from Congress and the American people. I say this as a former White House chief of staff who understands the instinct to keep sensitive information secret and out of public view. It is beyond dispute that some information must be closely held to protect national security and to engage in effective diplomacy, and that unauthorized disclosure can be extraordinarily harmful. But protecting technical means, human sources, operational details and intelligence methods cannot be an excuse for creating secret law to guide our institutions.

In refusing to release to Congress the rules and justifications governing a program that has conducted nearly 400 unmanned drone strikes and killed at least three Americans in the past four years, President Obama is ignoring the system of checks and balances that has governed our country from its earliest days. And in keeping this information from the American people, he is undermining the nation’s ability to be a leader on the world stage and is acting in opposition to the democratic principles we hold most important.

This is why I say, respectfully: Give them up, Mr. President.

Ann Telnaes animation: With his “kill list,” Obama follows in Bush and Cheney’s footsteps. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

Begin by fully sharing with the congressional committees that have jurisdiction all of the documents used by your administration to legally substantiate and govern the targeted killing program, including the justification for targeting U.S. citizens. The law that directs our government’s activities should not be kept secret.

All branches of the people’s government have the right to know the rules and standards under which the other branches act. Congress has the power to oversee the conduct of the executive branch, and lawmakers must be permitted to use it. As Woodrow Wilson wrote: “The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function.” Appropriate congressional oversight is critical in building long-term credibility with the public across the political spectrum for the actions the administration undertakes in the people’s name.

This isn’t to say that the executive branch is obligated to disclose information on operational details or case-specific profiles that are, deservedly, highly classified. But that information can be redacted without undermining the public’s understanding of the legal justification on which the government’s actions are based.

The American people have the right to know the laws they live under. In addition to allowing Congress to properly fulfill its oversight duties, the administration should make available to the public the criteria justifying the targeted killing of Americans and the safeguards put in place to protect against wrongful death.

This level of transparency is important for our democracy and for governments around the globe. The United States is not the only country with drone technology. We are not the only country with the ability to deploy cyberweapons. We are not the only country grappling with how to apply the rule of law — and the laws of war — when the nature of conflict has changed dramatically, and in a short time.

But we cannot lead if the American people are kept in the dark. We cannot lead if the world does not know the principles and laws that guide us, or if others can credibly say that our commitment to a government of the people, by the people and for the people is simply window-dressing, or that we sacrifice our constitutional principles when it is expedient.

James Madison said that “a popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy; or, perhaps, both.”

http://news.yahoo.com/schumer-immigration-bill-pass-senate-135548070.html,,[],Schumer: Immigration bill to pass Senate by July 4,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawmaker who helped negotiate a bipartisan bill to overhaul immigration predicted on Sunday that comprehensive legislation would overwhelmingly pass the Senate by July 4 while House Republicans cautioned that they would write their own version, one piece at a time.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he anticipates as many as 70 of the 100 senators will vote for the measure heading to the full Senate on June 10. Even if it passes there, the proposal faces tough prospects in the Republican-led House, where lawmakers are at work on their own piecemeal approach that could stall a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants living in this country illegally.

""We are moving forward because we believe in a bipartisan way this is so vital for America, and we'll have a good bill,"" Schumer said, pledging to allow colleagues to amend the legislation.

Not so fast, House lawmakers cautioned.

""That Senate bill is not going to move in the House,"" said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.

For months, four Democratic senators met with four Republican colleagues behind closed doors and developed a proposal that would enact new border controls and enforcement mechanisms in the workplace, allow tens of thousands of workers into the country legally for high- and low-skilled jobs and create a 13-year path to citizenship for those already living here illegally. It passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee last month by a vote of 13 to 5; three Republicans joined the Democratic majority.

House lawmakers, though, have pledged to put together their own measure — likely taking components of the comprehensive Senate plan one at a time and adding their own priorities.

""We think it's better to do it with a step-by-step approach,"" said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

""We'll continue down that path, but the final outcome in terms of the form of the legislation is not yet known,"" he added.

Democrats and Republicans alike recognized the political potency of the issue. The Senate, led by Democrats, is putting added pressure on the House, led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

Story continues

""Congressman Boehner is in a box. There are about 60 or 70 of his people who are against any immigration reform. But at the same time, he knows that the Republican Party will be consigned to a minority party for a generation if they're anti-immigration,"" Schumer said.

In 2012, President Barack Obama won re-election with 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 73 percent of Asian voters backing him. A thwarted immigration overhaul could send those voting blocs more solidly to Democrats' side.

""We are hard at work on this problem. We have a broken immigration system in the country, it needs to be fixed, our legal immigration, our enforcement and figuring out the appropriate legal status for people who are not lawfully present in the United States all need to be addressed,"" Goodlatte said.

But it is unlikely to be a sweeping answer in the House, lawmakers said.

""I don't know if we'll have comprehensive reform or we will have it piece-by-piece. But that Senate bill may not even pass the Senate itself,"" Ros-Lehtinen said.

Schumer spoke to NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Ros-Lehtinen was interviewed on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Goodlatte was on ""Fox News Sunday.""

“His choice of itinerary and his request for help were an absolute surprise for us. We did not invite him,” a Russian official told the newspaper.

However, Western countries suspect that the Russians asked Snowden to come to their consulate in Hong Kong, where he was hiding from U.S. authorities after leaking information about the NSA’s widespread spying. The Russians sent an invitation through the Chinese, “who were glad to get rid of him,” a Western source told Kommersant.

While Snowden contacted the Russian government in Hong Kong before getting on the Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Moscow was not his planned final destination, Russian government sources told the newspaper.

Snowden was supposed to fly to Havana after a 22-hour layover in Moscow, and connect to either Bolivia or Ecuador. However, he did not board the flight, to the chagrin of nearly the entire Moscow press corps who found his reserved seat 17A empty.

The United States pressured Cuba to prohibit the flight from landing if Snowden was on board, several sources told the newspaper. Cuba was one of the countries that the United States threatened with “unfavorable consequences” if it accepted Snowden, a source close to the State Department was quoted as saying by Kommersant.

A Russian official told Kommersant that before flying to Moscow, Snowden spent two days at the Russian consulate in Hong Kong. Snowden told the Russians that he planned to ask for political asylum in a Latin American country and presented a ticket to Havana, with a 22-hour layover in Moscow, dated June 23. He said that his life was in danger and asked for help, citing international conventions for refugees.

Snowden also celebrated his 30th birthday at the Russian consulate on June 21, according to an unnamed source close to the NSA leaker.

Russian officials would not comment publicly about the issues raised in the Kommersant piece.

David Kirkpatrick is the Times reporter who wrote the story that forced the paper’s Editorial page editor to defensively declare on Monday that it has not chosen to endorse Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. The editor said that the paper had a reporter on the ground who was witnessing the attacks.

That admission is even in Kirpatrick’s story, which, as Breitbart News reported, has received considerable blowback for attempting to “whitewash the Benghazi tragedy.” The Times alleges that there was no al-Qaeda involvement in the attacks that killed four Americans (contradicting the paper’s own reporting), that murdered U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens had “little understanding” of the region, and that the terrorists were motivated by an anti-Muhammed YouTube video:

Soon scores, if not hundreds, of others were racing to the scene. Some arrived with guns, some with cameras. The attackers had posted sentries at Venezia Road, adjacent to the compound, to guard their rear flank, but they let pass anyone trying to join the mayhem. Witnesses said young men rushing inside had left empty pickup trucks from Ansar al-Shariah, but also all the other big militias ostensibly allied with the government. There is no doubt that anger over the video motivated many attackers. A Libyan journalist working for The New York Times was blocked from entering by the sentries outside, and he learned of the film from the fighters who stopped him. Other Libyan witnesses, too, said they received lectures from the attackers about the evil of the film and the virtue of defending the prophet.

Kirkpatrick tweeted Monday night that the Times had “a reporter on the scene talking to the attackers during the attack.” His tweet prompted those on Twitter, including a former U.N. spokesperson for George W. Bush, to wonder if the Times knew who the attackers were and whether the reporter who was on the ground witnessed the murder of a U.S. Ambassador without calling for help:

Loiko Has Covered Wars', 'Crises', 'Daily Life In Russia', 'The Former Soviet States For The Los Angeles Times Since']",Russian foreign minister accuses U.S. of double standard on Syria,"MOSCOW -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Washington of applying a double standard in its approach to Syria and said its evidence that President Bashar Assad’s regime used chemical weapons is unconvincing.

“It is very odd to hear … my good friend, U.S. State Secretary John Kerry, claiming that the U.S. side presented Russians with irrefutable evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria,” Lavrov told students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Monday. “We were shown some data which contained nothing concrete: neither geographical coordinates, nor names nor proof that the probes were taken by professionals.”

Lavrov said the United States used a double standard in dealing with Syria and the Middle East in general.

“It is a personal issue based on a personal dislike for some authoritarian dictator, whereas dictators for whom there is no dislike are not talked about because they are assistants and allies for our Western partners,” he said. “Terrorists should not be divided into good and bad; it is absolutely unprofessional and shortsighted.”

Lavrov warned that a planned U.S. strike against Assad would jeopardize the prospects for a so-called Geneva 2 conference on Syria.

“If, to our common regret, the action declared by the U.S. president takes place … it will push the prospects of this forum far away, if not for good,” Lavrov said.

On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called Washington’s accusations against Assad’s regime “utter nonsense.”

Russia is sending another navy reconnaissance vessel toward the Syrian coast to assist a group of five boats already based in the Mediterranean.

“Russia is stepping up our navy presence in the area but we will not fight for Assad in this conflict,” Igor Korotchenko, editor in chief of the journal National Defense, said in an interview. “Moscow is just trying to prevent negative global consequences of this strike and primarily for U.S.-Russian relations, which are already at their worst in years.”

Korotchenko said that a U.S. strike would mark a significant new turn in the growing political confrontation between Russia and the United States.

“The fallout from this strike will be far more global than just dramatically aggravating the situation in the Middle East,” he said. “After this strike the Kremlin may irrevocably rethink its dealings with the U.S.A. and may bury for the foreseeable future all prospects of any partnership and any cooperation with Washington.”

Russian lawmakers say they intended to apply pressure on their U.S. counterparts before Congress votes on a strike against Syria. The speaker of the Russian parliament’s lower house, Sergei Naryshkin, told Putin that Russian lawmakers are asking U.S. lawmakers to take a balanced stand in their vote.

As unlikely as it may seem that members of Congress would be swayed by Russian arguments, Naryshkin insisted that his colleagues had influenced the debate on Syria in other countries.

“Last week we addressed … lawmakers of [European] countries and it turned out useful as parliaments of a number of European countries are taking a very balanced and sound position,” Naryshkin said in televised remarks during a Kremlin meeting with Putin on Monday. “So I think this special kind of work with U.S. congressmen could be of use.”

Putin approved the initiative, calling it “timely and right.” He added: ”I think your U.S. colleagues could have a better understanding of what the position of the Russian Federation is based on.”

http://news.yahoo.com/top-us-general-negotiations-done-afghan-deal-135914437.html,,[],Top US general: negotiations done on Afghan deal,"BAGRAM AIR FIELD, Afghanistan (AP) — America's top military officer said the U.S. has no intention to renegotiate a security deal with Afghanistan and that a full withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country at the end of 2014 could reverse gains made by the fledgling Afghan forces in their war against the Taliban.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters late Tuesday that although he is not yet planning a so-called ""zero-option"" to remove all U.S. forces at the end of 2014, a failure to sign the deal it could make it an ""unfortunate possibility.""

The U.S. wants it signed by Dec. 31, but Afghan President Hamid Karzai has so far refused to do so. It could keep thousands of U.S. troops here for up to a decade.

The agreement aims to help train and develop the Afghan National Security Forces, and allow for a smaller force to go after stubborn remnants of al-Qaida and other groups that Dempsey said still pose a threat to regional and global security.

Afghan forces were holding their ground, he said, but still need help.

Without a foreign presence, he said ""the development of the security forces will be impeded, will be slowed, and in some parts of the country I suspect could be reversed.""

After a year of negotiation, a deal was struck on the agreement last month and Karzai presented it to a national assembly known as a Loya Jirga for approval. The assembly not only endorsed the deal but demanded that Karzai sign it by the end of this month — which would have complied with an American request to allow time for planning a post-2014 presence.

""What was very clear is that over the course of an exhausting, really, negotiation over many months there was a text that was agreed upon. And that text was considered to be closed, at some point, and presented to the Loya Jirga,"" Dempsey told reporters at this base north of the capital. ""It's not our intention to reopen the text and to renegotiate that which had been already discussed.""

Story continues

Karzai says he wants his successor to sign it after the April 5 elections and has added new conditions since it was brokered. He says will sign only if the U.S. ends airstrikes and raids on Afghan homes and does more to help broker peace with the Taliban.

He has also lashed out at the United States, accusing it of making threats.

In an interview published Tuesday by the French daily Le Monde, Karzai said the U.S. was acting like a colonial power.

""The threats they are making, 'We won't pay salaries, we'll drive you into a civil war.' These are threats,"" Karzai was quoted as saying.

But Dempsey said: ""It's not a threat. I just simply think that in any negotiation you reach a point when you've made the requirements known. And militarily, by the way, those requirements are actually quite clear.""

Dempsey, who was here for a quick visit with U.S. troops ahead of the holidays, said he has not yet started making plans for a full withdrawal of all U.S. troops at the end of 2014, when a NATO mandate ends and all foreign combat forces leave the country.

""First of all I am still not planning for a zero option, although I do consider it to be an unfortunate possibility given the current impasse at achieving the bilateral security agreement,"" Dempsey said.

But he added that ""on the other hand we were encouraged by the vote of confidence from the Loya Jirga, which spoke, at least it was suggested that they spoke, on behalf of the majority of the Afghan people, so we are not planning a zero option although we clearly understand it could be a possibility.""

Allies such as Germany also want the agreement signed to allow NATO to prepare its own agreement for allied forces. Germany and other countries have said they will not stay without the United States. Germany currently has 3,300 forces here and has pledged about 800. The U.S. has 46,000 troops in Afghanistan and its allies have another 26,000.

German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who arrived in Afghanistan Wednesday to meet with his country's troops in Mazar-i-Sharif, said it was important for Karzai to sign as soon as possible to give the international contingent time to prepare, Germany's dpa news agency reported.

""I don't want to give a timeframe at this juncture when we've past the point logistically when it becomes impossible — that wouldn't be tactically smart,"" he said, but waiting until after elections was ""certainly too late.""

Dempsey agreed that delays would affect the coalition.

""I hope it's resonating, that we probably are a little more agile than our NATO partners who have their own political systems, their own dynamics, their own resource-budget cycles, and I think that the real risk in delaying is that we'll begin to affect the coalition,"" he said.

Dempsey described 2015 as a ""significant year of transition"" as Afghanistan stands up on its own with a newly-elected government.

""As in any government it will take time for that government that is elected, the newly elected government to establish itself, to settle itself, to begin to govern, and you know that is a level of uncertainty,"" he said, adding that Afghan forces ""will need a bit of support through that period.""

(CNN) —

Diplomatic tensions between the United States and Venezuela showed no signs of slowing Monday as the State Department announced that two Venezuelan diplomats had been expelled.

Orlando Jose Montanez Olivares and Victor Camacaro Mata were declared personae non gratae and ordered to leave the country in response to the South American nation’s decision to kick out two U.S. officials last week, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters.

“Around the world, when our people are thrown out unjustly, we’re going to take reciprocal action,” she said. “We need to do that to protect our own people.”

The expulsion of the Venezuelan diplomats comes after Venezuelan officials – just hours before announcing President Hugo Chavez’s death last week – said they were expelling two U.S. Embassy officials and accused them of plotting to destabilize the country.

“In the day or days that followed there was some pretty heated rhetoric coming in our direction,” Nuland said Monday. “I think I called it at one point a page from the old ‘Chavista’ playbook that we were hoping was going to change. … There is work that we would like to do together, particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, economics and energy relations, but it’s going to take a change of tone from Caracas.”

The expelled Venezuelan diplomats have left the United States, Nuland said. Camacaro worked in the Venezuelan Consulate in New York, and Montanez worked at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, she said.

The expelled U.S. officials, both air attaches at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, were accused of having meetings with members of the Venezuelan military and encouraging them to pursue “destabilizing projects,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said.

“We will not allow any foreign interference in our country,” Jaua said last week.

Nicolas Maduro, then vice president and now Venezuela’s interim leader, also suggested as he criticized the U.S. Embassy officials last week that someone had deliberately infected Chavez with cancer.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell denied the accusations.

“This fallacious assertion of inappropriate U.S. action leads us to conclude that, unfortunately, the current Venezuelan government is not interested an improved relationship,” he said.

It isn’t the first time that diplomatic tensions have surged between the two countries.

Last year the State Department declared Venezuela’s consul general in Miami persona non grata – Latin for unwelcome or unacceptable person – and expelled her from the United States. In 2008, Venezuela expelled the U.S. ambassador to the South American country. A day later, the United States said it was expelling the Venezuelan ambassador.

Nearly two years after the U.S. troop withdrawal, Iraq is in the midst of a deepening security crisis as an al-Qaeda affiliate wages a relentless campaign of attacks, sending the death toll soaring to its highest level since 2008.

In the latest violence, nine car bombs tore through markets and police checkpoints in Baghdad on Sunday, killing dozens of people.

The bloody campaign has virtually erased the security gains made in the past five years. More than 5,300 Iraqis have been killed this year.

Sunday’s attacks occurred just three days before Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is scheduled to arrive in Washington, where he will take part in meetings at the White House and on Capitol Hill. At the top of his agenda is a request for more U.S. help in the fight against the al-Qaeda affiliate, whose scope has grown to encompass neighboring Syria as well.

“We need to increase the depth and width of our cooperation, to be more agile and reflect the seriousness of the situation in Iraq,” Iraq’s ambassador to Washington, Lukman Faily, said in a telephone interview. “In our discussions, we will highlight the urgent need for the approval and quick delivery of military sales.”

View Graphic A single month's death toll from violence in Iraq.

At least 40 people died Sunday in attacks on mostly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name. In addition, a suicide bomber plowed his car into a group of soldiers in the northern city of Mosul, killing 14, according to a local police official.

More than 600 people have been killed in Iraq this month, after extraordinary bloodshed left 880 dead in September.

The surge in violence is largely, though not exclusively, due to attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, an outgrowth of al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group is trying to undermine the Iraqi state through a relentless campaign of car bombings, assaults on security forces and assassinations. ISIS has also carried out several jailbreaks, freeing militants whom American and Iraqi forces worked for years to capture.

Shattering of calm

Iraq once looked as though it could be stabilizing. After a horrific sectarian war engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007, the United States sent a surge of troops and began enlisting Sunni fighters to turn against al-Qaeda. When the U.S. military withdrew at the end of 2011, militant groups were on their heels and monthly civilian death tolls were in the dozens rather than the hundreds.

That period of relative safety lasted into 2012, but it began to unravel as Syria’s anti-government protest movement developed into a civil war fought along sectarian lines.

Many radical Sunni fighters in Iraq and Syria have now united under the banner of ISIS. The militants consider the two nations to be different fronts in a single war with an ambitious goal.

“They want a caliphate,” said Jessica Lewis, research director at the Institute for the Study of War, who has investigated the resurgence of al-Qaeda in Iraq. She was referring to the Islamic political system that ruled most Muslims after the death of the prophet Muhammad.

One of the group’s most important victories came in September 2012, when militants freed about 100 inmates from a prison in Tikrit. The infusion of manpower helped the organization intensify operations this past spring, Lewis said.

ISIS launched an even more devastating attack on the notorious Abu Ghraib prison on July 21, freeing more than 500 convicts who could bolster the group’s capabilities further in the coming months.

“My best estimate based on [the Tikrit] example is that we’re going to see another huge growth step in operational capability in the new year,” Lewis said.

Sectarian mistrust

The rise of ISIS has coincided with political dysfunction in Baghdad. During Iraq’s recent years of relative calm, Maliki has consolidated power in a way that has left many Sunnis feeling disenfranchised under the Shiite-­led government. Sunni leaders complain bitterly that he has used his control of Iraq’s security forces to sideline political opponents under the pretense of combating terrorism.

In the vast deserts of Anbar province in western Iraq, the government has deployed thousands of troops to patrol its nearly 400-mile-long boundary with Syria.

But the border has become largely theoretical, and militants have moved across it with ease. In the atmosphere of sectarian mistrust that pervades Iraq, the Shiite-­majority federal forces have not coordinated well with the province’s mainly Sunni tribes and local police, according to Anbar’s governor, Ahmed Khalaf al-Dulaimi.

Anbar has suffered at least seven major attacks in the past week, including assassinations of local political leaders, the siege of a government electricity office and assaults on checkpoints.

The largest operation was an Oct. 20 attempt to storm a police compound in the city of Fallujah that includes a prison. The assault by 25 men armed with guns and mortars was ultimately repulsed, according to a police official involved in the response, but the battle lasted five hours and left four police officers dead.

On the other side of the sectarian divide, Iraq’s various Shiite militias, some of which receive funding and strategic direction from Iran, appear to be stepping up operations. Public funerals throughout southern Iraq memorialize militia members who have died fighting for the regime in Syria, and there are growing signs that some militias are bringing the fight back to Iraq.

In the southern Shiite-

majority provinces of Basra and Dhi Qar, at least 12 members of the Sunni Sadoon tribe have been killed in recent weeks, according to a senior Basra police official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Dozens more members of the tribe in Dhi Qar have reported receiving death threats, and at least eight families have fled their homes, according to Haider Salman, a municipal council leader.

In Basra, the threats against Sunnis are so serious that Sheik Abdul Kareem al-Khazraji, who heads the government authority that administers Sunni religious sites, ordered mosques to close their doors because of the risk of attacks on large gatherings of worshipers.

“We are directing people to pray at home, to protect their lives,” Khazraji said.

To the north, militias have been active in Shiite-dominated pockets of Diyala province. Six Sunnis were killed in Muqdadiyah, according to a tribal leader in the area who identified himself as Sheik Abu Muhammad.

Such incidents are haunting for Iraqis who recall the violence of the last decade. The killing rose exponentially in 2006 when attacks on Shiite religious sites prompted militias to retaliate with campaigns of sectarian killing and intimidation.

The bloodshed this year has not reached those terrible peaks. But al-Qaeda’s leaders in Iraq again seem determined to use horrific violence to provoke retaliation by the government and Shiite militias. Sunday’s attacks targeted predominantly Shiite areas in Baghdad. In recent weeks, car bombs in Baghdad have targeted not only day laborers and markets, but also funerals and even a playground full of children.

As the death toll mounts, Iraq is approaching national elections in April. In past years, militants have typically stepped up attacks before elections in an attempt to intimidate voters and create an atmosphere of fear. The result has been beneficial for campaigns defined by sectarian and ethnic politics.

“Imagine Iraq as a ship in the middle of a storm,” Maliki said in a televised interview in early October, “and some of the cabin crew ask the captain to control the movement of the ship. How can he do this with all of the high waves?”"

The first was his handshake with Cuban leader Raul Castro; the second was the “selfie” he posed for with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Taking the second one first, critics said it was disrespectful for the president to be clowning around with the two PMs in the middle of a funeral. Well, it wasn’t a funeral; it was a memorial service that, for much of its long duration, was filled with laughter and crowds of dancing South Africans celebrating the life of their departed leader. Agence France-Presse photographer Roberto Schmidt, who took the photo of the three leaders snapping an iPhone picture of themselves, was appalled at the reaction to his image.

Schmidt said: “The world leaders were simply acting like human beings, like me and you. I doubt anyone could have remained totally stony faced for the duration of the ceremony, while tens of thousands of people were celebrating in the stadium.... I see nothing to complain about, and probably would have done the same in their place.”

The handshake with Castro was even less remarkable. If one watches the video of the moment, it can be seen that Obama is making his way to his seat past a line of already-seated dignitaries. Castro just happened to be first in the row. It would have been exceedingly awkward and truly significant if Obama had refused to shake the man’s hand.

Nevertheless, the usual cranks on the right were appalled.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) even made the wildly off-base, but predictable, comparison to pre-World War II British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain shaking hands with Adolf Hitler. This is the same McCain who gave a handshake and a slight bow to Libya’s now-deposed and deceased crackpot dictator Moammar Kadafi a few years ago.

Raul Castro is an old man running a fading regime. He’s not even the Castro anybody cares about - Fidel. More than half a century of boycotting Cuba has not brought the communist government down or freed many political prisoners. In the meantime, presidents have been shaking plenty of dictatorial hands with blood on them - most notably a long line of Chinese leaders.

Maintaining a belligerent stance against Cuban commies is no longer an issue with staying power for conservatives. Even in Florida’s Cuban community, the young people do not care anymore. They would prefer more handshakes and a plan for Cuba’s future.

Actually, the most remarkable thing about the handshake was the lack of reaction. Most Americans were not disturbed. Most are ready for the kind of reconciliation Mandela preached. It’s another indication that militant conservatives are lagging way behind in understanding that the times they are a-changin’."

Washington (CNN) - As North Korea increases its alarming threats against South Korea and the United States the past few weeks, a new national survey suggests that Americans are listening.

And a CNN/ORC International poll also indicates that for the first time, a majority of the public is pessimistic that the situation involving North Korea's missile program can be solved by diplomatic and economic means alone.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

According to the survey, 41% of Americans now characterize North Korea an immediate threat to the United States, an all-time high for that measure.

""If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wanted to get the attention of the American public, his strategy is starting to work,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""The 41% who now consider North Korea an immediate threat to the United States is up 13 percentage points in less than a month.""

Another 41% say that North Korea is a long-term threat to the U.S and 16% say the isolated regime is not a threat.

North Korea has issued a catalog of alarming threats against the South and the U.S. in the past several weeks, sharpening its rhetoric after the U.N. Security Council imposed stricter sanctions for Pyongyang's latest underground nuclear test, which took place in February. The strong words have put the region on edge.

South Korea said Sunday that it believed Pyongyang could conduct a missile test this week after recently moving the necessary components to the coast.

According to the poll, only 46% of the public says the crisis can be successfully resolved with diplomatic or economic means alone, with 51% disagreeing.

""For the first time, Americans are pessimistic that the situation involving North Korea can be resolved using only economic and diplomatic means,"" says Holland. ""On previous occasions when tensions with North Korea were running high, most Americans thought that diplomacy would be enough, although that number has dropped over the years as those tensions have re-emerged time after time.""

Should the U.S. use troops to defend South Korea if that country is attacked by the north?

The survey indicates that six in ten would support a military response to an attack on South Korea, with a majority of all demographic groups approving that action.

The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International, from April 5-7, with 1,012 adults nationwide questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

President Barack Obama has won backing from key figures in the U.S. Congress in his call for limited U.S. strikes on Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad for his suspected use of chemical weapons against civilians.

The ship, Moskva, will take over operations from a naval unit in the region that Moscow says is needed to protect national interests. It will be joined by a destroyer from Russia's Baltic Fleet and a frigate from the Black Sea Fleet.

""The Cruiser Moskva is heading to the Gibraltar Straits. In approximately 10 days it will enter the east Mediterranean, where it will take over as the flagship of the naval task force,"" the source said.

Moscow has been Assad's most powerful ally, protecting him from consecutive U.N. security resolutions aimed at pressuring him to end violence. Russia insists the conflict must be solved through political dialogue in which Assad must take part.

Nonetheless, President Vladimir Putin, in an interview released on Wednesday, did not rule out approving a military operation if clear evidence showed Damascus had carried out the attacks, but said any attack would be illegal without U.N. support.

Last week, the Defence Ministry said new warships, including the Moskva, were being sent to the Mediterranean but described the movements as routine deployments.

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said Russia has no intention of getting dragged into any military conflict over Syria.

Earlier this week, Interfax reported that Russia was also sending a reconnaissance ship to the region but that it would operate separately from the naval unit.

Updated at 11:48 a.m. ET on 8/25



Washington (CNN) – Two key members of congressional foreign affairs panels say they expect the United States to strike Syria following reports of chemical weapons attacks in that country last week, though other lawmakers interviewed Sunday cautioned that unilateral action would be misguided.

""I think we will respond in a surgical way and I hope the president, as soon as we get back to Washington, will ask for authorization from Congress to do something in a very surgical and proportional way. Something that gets their attention, that causes them to understand that we are not going to put up with that kind of activity,"" Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on ""Fox News Sunday.""



But Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs panel, said President Barack Obama may not need to wait for congressional authorization.

""Congress needs to be involved but perhaps not initially,"" Engel said. ""Perhaps the president could start and then Congress needs to resolve it and assent to it. We cannot sit still. We've got to move and we've got to move quickly.""

Another Democrat, however, said the United States should only intervene militarily in Syria with the backing of an international coalition.

“This has to be an international operation, it can’t be a unilateral American approach,” Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

“We can’t let ourselves get into a situation where this becomes a springboard for a general military operation in Syria to try and change the dynamic,” Reed said. “That dynamic is going to be long term, very difficult, and ultimately established by the Syrians, not by foreign powers.”

Rep. Mike McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CBS he didn’t think Americans “have an appetite to put troops on the ground in Syria.”

The situation in Syria escalated dramatically last week after reports the government there used chemical weapons in civilian areas.

Opposition groups say over a thousand people died in the attack with thousands more affected by the gas.

CNN cannot independently verify the causality claims.

Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister said Sunday that the government will allow United Nations inspectors to visit the site of the alleged attack, but that may be too late.

""If the Syrian government had nothing to hide and wanted to prove to the world that it had not used chemical weapons in this incident, it would have ceased its attacks on the area and granted immediate access to the UN – five days ago. At this juncture, the belated decision by the regime to grant access to the UN team is too late to be credible,"" a senior Obama administration official said Sunday.

Over 100,000 people are estimated to have perished so far in Syria's civil war.

Schumer Debate persists over whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor

(CNN) —

The fragile U.S.-Russia relationship – already frayed by disagreements over Syria, Iran and nuclear arms – showed another sign of strain Sunday, as American lawmakers blasted the country’s President Vladimir Putin for allowing NSA leaker Edward Snowden to land in Moscow while evading U.S. espionage charges.

Snowden, who has admitted leaking top-secret information about government surveillance programs, left Hong Kong on Sunday and later touched down in Moscow, according to Wikileaks, which helped him travel. While Russia is not believed to be his final destination – Ecuador’s prime minister said Snowden applied for asylum in his country – lawmakers on Sunday were quick to fault Putin for harboring a man the U.S. government desperately wants back.

“Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran, and now, of course, with Snowden,” Sen. Chuck Schumer said on CNN’s State of the Union. “That’s not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.”

That relationship was already showing signs of strain at last week’s Group of Eight conference in Northern Ireland, where global leaders pressured Putin on his country’s support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which extends back to the Cold War and Assad’s father. At a joint appearance that followed a bilateral meeting last week, Putin and President Barack Obama were tense and unsmiling and offered no indication their deep disagreements about the way forward in war-torn Syria were any closer to being resolved.

Why would Snowden head for Ecuador?

Later in the week, Obama publicly pressured Russia to join the United States in slashing its supply of nuclear weapons, saying both nations needed to “move beyond Cold War nuclear postures.”

Obama delivered his remarks at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, which for decades symbolized the East-West divide.

On Sunday, however, the divide between the United States and Russia persisted. Schumer, a New York Democrat, suggested on CNN that Putin personally approved Snowden’s landing in Moscow on Sunday.

“Very few are the areas in which he does cooperate (with the U.S.) these days. I think this action, Putin allowing Snowden to land in Russia and then go somewhere else, is going to have serious consequences for the U.S.-Russian relationship,” Schumer said.

His characterization of Russia’s stance was echoed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, an infrequent ally of Schumer’s, who spoke on “Fox News Sunday.”

“I hope we’ll chase him to the ends of the earth, bring him to justice and let the Russians know there will be consequences if they harbor this guy,” said Graham, who represents South Carolina.

“They want to be part of the world community, the (World Trade Organization). They want a good relationship with the United States. They should hold this felon and send him back home for justice,” Graham said. Russia joined the World Trade Organization last August after nearly two decades of negotiations. Before being admitted, it was the largest economy not represented at the global trade body.

As lawmakers spoke Sunday, it remained unclear where Snowden’s final destination would be, though he was not expected to remain in Russia. Snowden’s U.S. passport has been revoked, according to a source familiar with the matter, setting up any travel out of Russia to become a major diplomatic flashpoint.

“Persons wanted on felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States,” State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

Earlier in June, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would consider a request for political asylum from Snowden, but that such a request from the NSA leaker had not yet been made.

Peskov, in an indication of the Kremlin’s stance, also wrote on Twitter, “The U.S. security services were breaking the laws of their country by tapping phone calls and conducting Internet surveillance.”

Wikileaks’ Assange urges support for Snowden, slams Obama

“Snowden, same as Assange, is a human rights activist,” he continued, referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, currently holed up at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he’s been granted asylum.

Asked Sunday whether he believed Putin had advance knowledge of Snowden’s travel plans, Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, “That wouldn’t surprise me.”

“Russia is a country that wants to get back on the world stage, and I don’t think they really care if they do it in a way that’s in the best interest of good citizenship around the world,” Rogers said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” citing Putin’s stance on Syria and nuclear disarmament.

“I’m sure they would love to have a little coffee and a few conversations with Mr. Snowden,” continued the Michigan Republican, referring to the Russians. “That’s why this is so serious and why we need to be so aggressive in making sure that people understand the difference between somebody who betrays their country and gives secrets away that will protect American lives at the expense of whatever he hopes to gain in the company of the Russians.”

Rogers’ remarks underscored the debate between those who believe Snowden committed an act of treason and those who view him as a hero promoting greater government transparency. The debate has created unlikely alliances in Washington, where some Democrats find themselves on the same side as Republicans – and opposite their base – in calling for Snowden’s arrest.

An empty debate? Why little will happen to change how we snoop

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, was loudly booed and heckled at a conference of progressives Saturday when she asserted Snowden had broken the law. Earlier, she drew a distinction between lawmakers like herself, who oversee the nation’s security, and privacy-minded citizens.

“I know that some of you attribute heroic status to that action,” she said, referring to Snowden’s leaks. “But, again, you don’t have the responsibility for the security of the United States. Those of us who do have to strike a different balance.”

“I don’t think this man is a whistle-blower,” another California Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “Whatever his motives are, and I take him at face value, he could have stayed and faced the music. I don’t think running is a noble thought.”

That view was countered by Sen. Rand Paul, a libertarian-minded Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few U.S. lawmakers to praise Snowden. While he warned Snowden would be discredited if he “cozies up to the Russian government,” Paul suggested the former CIA employee had lived up to his duty as a citizen by exposing what he felt were government misdeeds.

“I would say that Mr. Snowden hasn’t lied to anyone. He did break his oath of office, but part of his oath of office is to the Constitution,” Paul said on CNN, adding: “He was simply coming forward and telling the truth – that your government was lying.”

The world is seeing as a handful of mujahideen under the leadership of Mullah Omar are defeating one of the most powerful super powers in the history of the world. …When the U.S. attacked Afghanistan [in October 2001], the people of intellect were wondering how long it would take for America to suffer its inevitable defeat and who would be leading its army when it would eventually drag its defeated tail out of Afghanistan.

The excerpts also show a juxtaposition between the rise of poverty and want in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev in the 1980s and the rise of traditional poverty indicators under Obama during this time in office. Whereas Gorbachev had to introduce a “war-food system of food distribution for his citizens,” America has witnessed a poverty increase from 37.3 million in 2007 to 46.9 million in 2010, according to Azan.

Moreover, the article touches on the “severe public discontent” under Gorbachev and the movements calling for “separation” which erupted in parts of the Soviet Union at that time. In the same way, the article claims there are “various movements” likewise calling for separation in the U.S. now. According to Azan, “around 30 states [are] calling for separation.”

Although the figure of “30 states” is wrong, the overarching goal of the article may still prove successful–that goal is to show that Obama, like Gorbachev before him, is a weak man who’s losing his grip on this own country while simultaneously facing defeat abroad.

The tagline is simple–Obama is weak like Gorbachev, the U.S. is being defeated like the U.S.S.R."

Snowden, Mr. Kucherena — the Russian lawyer helping the former intelligence contractor with his asylum request — was asked to explain what was in the brown paper shopping bag he had left behind.

Mr. Kucherena, a supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin who reportedly sits on the public council of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B., told the press scrum that he had brought his client a change of clothes and English translations of books by three Russian authors — Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Anton Chekhov and Nikolai Karamzin — that might help Mr. Snowden, an American, learn about the nation around the airport he has been trapped in for the past month.

Advisor Anatoly Kucherenka seemed to be really enjoying himself as he told press #Snowden wouldn’t be leaving. //t.co/1OdGIB8RX8 — Tom Barton (@TomBartonJourno) 24 Jul 13

Perhaps inevitably, journalists with a taste for the absurd wondered just what Mr. Snowden might learn about modern Russia from the first two authors, whose great works of fiction and drama portrayed human dilemmas a century before the era of Total Information Awareness.

Snowden’s lawyer gave him Dostoevsky, Chekhov, fresh clothing. “You shld know who Raskolnikov was” lawyer told him, he says on Russian TV — Michael Birnbaum (@michaelbirnbaum) 24 Jul 13

Writing in The New Republic, Julia Ioffe observed, “Kucherena said he brought Snowden a copy of Dostoyevsky’s ‘Crime and Punishment,’ and some Chekhov ‘for dessert.’ It’s time, he said, for the young man to ‘learn about our reality.’ The reality that lies before Snowden, however, is not that of a Petersburg slum or a cherry orchard.”

That left the question of what Mr. Snowden’s lawyer thought a would-be citizen might learn about life in Mr. Putin’s Russia by reading Karamzin, the court historian to Czar Alexander I who began his 12-volume “History of the Russian State” in 1816.

Quite a lot, perhaps.

As the Harvard professor emeritus Richard Pipes explained in the introduction to his translation and analysis of Karamzin’s “Memoir on Ancient and Modern Russia,” this conservative Russian thinker’s work offers a glimpse of a world in which “many Russians believed that autocracy was the only regime capable of providing the country with stability and assuring it of great power status: any alternative to it spelled chaos.”

Mr. Pipes told The Lede in an e-mail that Karamzin was “a prominent Russian conservative historian, poet and novelist.”

Between 1816 and 1826 he published in 12 volumes The History of the Russian State in which he extolled the role that the tsars played in making Russia a great power. It was the first coherent account of Russia’s past. Inasmuch as Putin is both a conservative and a nationalist, he very likely admires Karamzin’s History.

In his introduction to Karamzin’s “Memoir,” Mr. Pipes noted that it was written “for Alexander I in 1810-11 to discourage him from proceeding with his liberal reforms.” He added: “Karamzin’s argument was purely pragmatic: history has shown that Russia thrived under autocracy and declined whenever the country departed from it. Proof of this contention he found in the collapse of the Kievan state and the resultant conquest of Russia by the Mongols, as well as in the so-called Time of Troubles of the early 17th century when the country disintegrated following the expiration of the Rurik dynasty.”

In one passage from the Pipes translation of “Memoir,” Karamzin argued:

Autocracy has founded and resuscitated Russia. Any change in her political constitution has led in the past and must lead in the future to her perdition, for she consists of very many and very different parts, each of which has its own civic needs; what save unlimited monarchy can produce in such a machine the required unity of action?"

The exercises come in the wake of a recent nuclear test in North Korea

South Korea's military is already in a state of heightened alert

Ahead of annual, routine military exercises between South Korea and the United States, North Korea issued its usual caustic objections Saturday.

It threatened ""miserable destruction,"" if ""your side ignites a war of aggression by staging the reckless joint military exercises ... at this dangerous time.""

Though customary, the stark posturing by North Korea stands in the shadow of an underground nuclear test two weeks ago that was preceded by the launch of a long-range missile capable of transporting a warhead.

The detonation of the nuclear charge was the third in Pyongyang's history and the first under supreme leader Kim Jong Un's rule. South Korea's military reacted with fierce military drills, including a public display of newly deployed cruise missiles with pinpoint accuracy.

It has been on heightened readiness ever since.

The test also triggered a global wave of condemnation, including from Beijing, and plans for new sanctions against Pyongyang.

North Korea issued the objections to exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle scheduled for March and April to U.S. commander James D. Sherman, state run news agency KCNA reported.

The message was delivered over the phone in English, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.

It also condemned the threat of new sanctions over North Korea's recent actions.

A United Nations military commission informed Pyongyang of the upcoming routine exercises, according to a joint statement from U.S. and South Korean military officials.

The commission also told North Korea that they are ""not related with the current situations on the Korean Peninsula.""

Around 10,000 U.S. forces will participate in Foal Eagle from March 1 to April 30. Key Resolve will involve 10,000 South Korean troops and 3,500 U.S. troops in exercises March 11 to 21.

Key Resolve will include U.N. troops and neutral supervisors."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/09/09/Putin-takes-advantage-of-kerry-blunder,2013-09-09 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],Putin Takes Advantage of Kerry Blunder,"In what looks like an off-the-cuff blunder, Secretary of State John Kerry might have accidentally given Russian President Vladmir Putin the opportunity to muddy the international diplomatic waters and buy his friends in Syria some time.

During a press briefing on Monday, Kerry said that Assad could avoid American air strikes by giving up all his chemical weapons within a week. Within hours, the State Department was forced to walk Kerry’s new red line back with the claim that he was making a “rhetorical argument about the impossibility and unlikelihood of Assad turning over chemical weapons he has denied he used.”

It seems, then, reasonable to conclude that Kerry spoke out of turn. Kerry was not authorized to offer Syria an “out” or a new ultimatum. But Kerry’s hypothetical hyperbole appears to have already backfired.

In an obvious desire to make Kerry pay for his flub and throw a wrench in Obama’s determination to go to war with Syria, Putin has seized upon Kerry’s hypothetical and called on Syria to accept Kerry’s offer and turn over all of its chemical weapons. No one believes Assad would ever willingly give up his chemical weapons, but should he agree to an offer the Obama administration did not mean to make, it could stall American action for weeks and even months.

Syria is already warming to the idea.

This complication could be a major blow to all of the Obama administration’s prepared plans to punish Assad for using the weapons and to change the balance of power in the ongoing Syrian civil war. Public opposition to Obama’s war is already surging. Weeks or months from now, after the torturous international diplomatic process that no one believes would end with Assad giving up the chemical weapons that keep him in power winds down, it is doubtful Congress or the American public would be ready to stomach a renewed push for war.

But now that Putin has suggested Syria say “yes” to an offer Kerry was sure no one would accept, the Associated Press is reporting that the State Department will take a “hard look” at Russia’s proposal.

Just like Obama’s unscripted “red line” comment that started this debacle, it looks as though another off-teleprompter administration blunder has shoved America’s foreign policy into a corner.

http://news.yahoo.com/china-military-sends-air-patrols-defense-zone-033423305.html,,[],"China scrambles jets to new defense zone, eyes U.S., Japan flights","By Ben Blanchard and Roberta Rampton BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China scrambled jets on Friday in response to two U.S. spy planes and 10 Japanese aircraft, including F-15 fighters, entering its new air defense zone over the East China Sea, state news agency Xinhua said, raising the stakes in a standoff with the United States, Japan and South Korea. The jets were scrambled for effective monitoring, Xinhua cited air force spokesman Shen Jinke as saying. The report gave no further details. Japan and South Korea flew military aircraft through the zone, which includes the skies over islands at the heart of a territorial dispute between Japan and China, the two countries said on Thursday. Washington sent two unarmed B-52 bombers into the airspace earlier this week and U.S. officials confirmed on Friday that U.S. flights were ""routinely"" transiting the zone. ""These flights are consistent with long standing and well known U.S. freedom of navigation policies,"" Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said. ""I can confirm that the U.S. has and will continue to operate in the area as normal."" One U.S. defense official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the routine operations included reconnaissance and surveillance flights. Xinhua earlier said China had sent several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft into the new air defense zone. China last week announced that foreign aircraft passing through it - including passenger planes - would have to identify themselves to Chinese authorities. The Chinese patrol mission, conducted on Thursday, was ""a defensive measure and in line with international common practices"", Xinhua reported Shen as saying. The aircraft, including Russian-designed Su-30 fighter jets, conducted routine patrols and monitored targets in the zone, Shen said. ""China's air force is on high alert and will take measures to deal with diverse air threats to firmly protect the security of the country's airspace,"" he said. However, Defence Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said it was ""incorrect"" to suggest China would shoot down aircraft which entered the zone without first identifying themselves. He did not elaborate. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Friday he did not know if Chinese planes were in the zone but added there was no change to Japan's sense of alertness. Ties between China and Japan have been strained for months by the dispute over the islands in the East China Sea, called the Diaoyu by China and the Senkaku by Japan. Washington takes no position on the sovereignty of the islands but recognizes Tokyo's administrative control and says the U.S.-Japan security pact applies to them. Europe's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, said the European Union was concerned about China's decision to establish the new air defense zone as well as its announcement of ""emergency defense measures"" if other parties did not comply. ""This development heightens the risk of escalation and contributes to raising tensions in the region,"" Ashton said. ""The EU calls on all sides to exercise caution and restraint."" CRITICISM China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang criticized Ashton's remarks, saying China hoped the EU could treat the situation ""objectively and rationally"". ""Actually, Madam Ashton should know that some European countries also have air defense identification zones,"" Qin said. ""I don't know if this leads to tensions in the European regional situation. European countries can have air defense identification zones. Why can't China?"" Asked to clarify China's expectations for what information airlines were expected to report, Qin said: ""International law does not have clear rules on what kind of flight or airplane should apply"", adding that each country made its own rules. ""Therefore, China's method does not violate international law and accords with international practice,"" he said. China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that since the zone had come into force there had been no impact on the safe operation of international civilian flights, although it added that China ""hoped"" airlines would cooperate. Japan's two biggest airlines have defied the identification order since Wednesday at the request of the Japanese government. Although there are risks of a confrontation in the zone, U.S. and Chinese military officials have stepped up communication with each other in recent years and are in regular contact to avoid accidental clashes. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will visit China, Japan and South Korea next week, and will try to ease tensions over the issue, senior U.S. officials said. ""We decline to comment on Chinese flights, but the United States will continue to partner with our allies and operate in the area as normal,"" a Pentagon spokesman said. China's Defence Ministry has said that it was aware of the U.S., Japanese and South Korean military aircraft in the zone and had tracked them all. Ties between China and Japan, often tense, have increasingly been frayed in recent years by regional rivalry, mutual mistrust over military intentions and what China feels is Japan's lack of contrition over its brutal occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two. In a show of support for the military, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a base in Jinan in eastern China, where he said ""military training is critical to beef up the PLA's (People's Liberation Army) war capacities"", according to the Xinhau news agency. Xi did not make direct mention of the East China Sea air defense zone. ""Though life is becoming better, history can't be forgotten and those who made sacrifices for (the) new China's founding must be remembered,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying in a separate report. The Global Times, an influential tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, praised the government for its calm response in the face of ""provocations"", saying China would not target the United States in the zone as long as it ""does not go too far"". But it warned Japan it could expect a robust response if it continued to fly military aircraft in the zone. ""If the trend continues, there will likely be frictions and confrontations and even a collision in the air ... It is therefore an urgent task for China to further train its air force to make full preparation for potential conflicts,"" it wrote in an editorial on Friday.

Not so much,"CARACAS, Venezuela -- Does Edward Snowden know what he’d be getting into if he ends up gaining asylum here? Many Venezuelans doubt it.

The former National Security Agency contractor remains in Russia seeking at least temporary asylum. But leaders in Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua have to varying degrees said they would be willing to take him in if he can work out a way to get to those countries.

Venezuelans interviewed in recent days say they have more pressing concerns than taking in Snowden, who is wanted by the U.S. government on espionage charges for having leaked details of the government’s efforts to monitor email and voice communications.

“It would be better for Venezuela if he stayed far away,” said 57-year-old Caracas bus driver Sergio Chacon.

“But if they do bring him, all I ask is that he keep his mouth shut and not live off the money of Venezuelans,” Chacon said. “I believe his only intention would be to bother people.”

Said real estate agent Beatriz Monterola, 69: “The government offered asylum just to stick it to the U.S., but Snowden would only bring more headaches than the ones we already have.”

Snowden has been stuck in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport since June 23. On July 9, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro became the first foreign leader to formally offer him asylum, a move that was later matched by the two other countries. All three are all left-leaning governments and frequent critics of U.S. foreign policy.

Some analysts have suggested Maduro was trying to divert Venezuelans’ attention from problems on the home front, including rampant violent crime, scarcities, high inflation and a stagnant economy.

“The asylum offer was a failed attempt to try to change the political agenda,” said political scientist Jose Vicente Carrasquero. “But when people suffer for their basic subsistence, it’s not so easy to divert their attention.”

Yelicer Hernandez, a 33-year-old apartment building concierge in an upscale Caracas neighborhood, said he was willing to give Maduro the benefit of the doubt.

“If President Maduro offers him asylum, it’s so [Snowden] can find a secure place to live, and we will welcome him here,” Hernandez said.

But several people interviewed at random this week in Caracas had no idea who Snowden was. And among those who did, many were concerned that Venezuela would be needlessly involving itself in an international dispute with an uncertain outcome.

“It’s up to the U.S. and Russia to resolve the situation of this guy in the airport,” said 23-year-old university mathematics student Arturo Marcano.

Computer student Maria Cristina Perez, 22, said Snowden’s arrival might only aggravate Venezuelans’ problems.

“The United States is a powerful country that could carry out reprisals for giving asylum to someone they consider a traitor,” she said. “An economic blockade would make scarcities more acute when we have enough problems as it is.”

Columnist Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez wrote in El Universal, a Caracas newspaper that frequently opposes government policies, that offering asylum to Snowden was hypocritical because the government pressures opposition politicians, judges and news media in Venezuela.

“Who are they to sermonize to the rest of the world on human rights?” Lansberg-Rodriguez wrote.

Caracas hairdresser Jose Molina, 28, said some Venezuelans had become political refugees in other countries to escape persecution at home merely for having opposed the government.

“Everyone has the right to ask for asylum when their life is in danger, but this Mr. Snowden committed a crime, betrayed his country, and should face the consequences,” Molina said.

Andres Schmucke wrote a humorous column in El Universal wondering how Snowden would cope with rampant crime and scarcities.

“He could spend the mornings looking for flour and toilet paper,” Schmucke wrote. “Ha! Welcome to Venezuela, gringo!”

Washington (CNN) – President Barack Obama has responded to critics who disagree with his handling of the situation in Syria, saying he's more concerned about the end goal - no chemical weapons in Syria - than about ""style points.""

In an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" Obama downplayed the controversy over Vladimir Putin's opinion piece in The New York Times last week, saying ""this is not a Cold War"" and that he welcomes the Russian president's involvement in the issue.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

As for the public perception of his own management of the U.S. response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, Obama said, ""Folks here in Washington like to grade on style.""

""And so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear - they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy,"" he continued. ""We know that, 'cause that's exactly how they graded the Iraq War - until it ended up… blowing up in our face.""

Asked by ABC's George Stephanopoulos whether the recent events changed his view of former President George W. Bush, Obama said, ""No, no. What it says is that I'm less concerned about style points. I'm much more concerned about getting the policy right.""

Obama got some of his most candid criticism last week from an ally, Republican Sen. Bob Corker. The senator told CNN's Dana Bash that the president has lost his credibility and is ""very uncomfortable being commander in chief.""

And following a deal reached between the U.S. and Russia on Saturday for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons to international control, two Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, said the Syria deal ""does nothing to resolve the real problem in Syria"" and allows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to ""go on slaughtering innocent civilians and destabilizing the Middle East.""

Talking about his relationship with Putin, Obama said he doesn't think his Russian counterpart ""has the same values that we do"" and that Putin has a ""different attitude about the Assad regime."" But, he said, both countries ""have an interest in preventing chaos"" and ""preventing terrorism.""

""This is not a contest between the United States and Russia. I mean, the fact of the matter is that if Russia wants to have some influence in Syria post-Assad, that doesn't hurt our interests,"" he said.

""And I think there's a way for Mr. Putin, despite me and him having a whole lot of differences, to play an important role in that,"" he continued. ""And so I welcome him being involved. I welcome him saying, 'I will take responsibility for pushing my client, the Assad regime, to deal with these chemical weapons.'""

On Iran, Obama said recent negotiations over Syria could still deter Tehran from building nuclear weapons, even though the U.S. did not use force to address the chemical weapons crisis in Syria.

The president confirmed that he and the new Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, have communicated indirectly through letters. Obama believes Iran understands that the nuclear issue is far more significant to U.S. security interests than are chemical weapons in Syria.

""A nuclear arms race in the region is something that would be profoundly destabilizing,"" he said. ""And so I - my suspicion is that the Iranians recognize they shouldn't draw a lesson that we haven't struck to think we won't strike Iran. On the other hand … what they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically.""

""Negotiations with the Iranians is always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy,"" he added. ""But you know, my view is that if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort, that in fact you can strike a deal."""

http://news.yahoo.com/secret-must-rely-locals-abroad-080315565--politics.html,,[],Secret Service must rely on locals abroad,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In the hours before President Barack Obama arrived at a Johannesburg soccer stadium to honor Nelson Mandela, the White House staff was in the dark on key details. Where would the president and Michelle Obama sit? When was Obama supposed to speak? Who else would be on stage when he did?

The result was an array of confusion and security risks that typically would not be tolerated by the Secret Service in the United States, underscoring how the agency is often at the mercy of foreign governments to make arrangements when the president travels overseas.

While there were metal detectors and x-ray machines at the stadium, they were not used on the initial crowds streaming in for the ceremony, according to Associated Press reporters on scene. Many people walked through with little or no screening. Inside the massive stadium there were few signs of the heavy security that routinely would accompany an event with the president and other world leaders.

The VIP section where Obama and dozens of other dignitaries sat, including former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, was protected by a short pane of protective glass that covered only those sitting in the first row of seats. Obama and his wife were seated several rows back. Large crowds were allowed to gather in front of where Obama sat, with no visible security nearby.

And when Obama made his way to the stage to deliver his speech, the South African sign-language interpreter who stood an arm's length away was a schizophrenic prone to violence. The interpreter has since been derided as a fraud and allegedly has a criminal background.

Secret Service officials say the South African government was responsible for the decision to place interpreter Thamsanqa Jantjie just inches from some of the most powerful people in the world during a four-hour memorial service.

""Program items such as stage participants or sign-language interpreters were the responsibility of the host organizing committee,"" said Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. ""For the purposes of this memorial service, this would include vetting them for criminal history and other appropriate records checks.""

Story continues

Brian Dube, a spokesman for the Ministry of State Security, declined to answer questions Saturday about what security measures were in place at the soccer stadium and what sort of background checks and screening were performed on Jantjie. Dube said those issues are part of the investigation into the hiring and use of the bogus interpreter, and he did not know when the investigation would be concluded.

Dube spoke a day after South Africa's government was confronted with a new, chilling allegation about Jantjie: He was reportedly accused of murder 10 years ago. Officials said they were investigating the revelation by the national eNCA TV news station. But they were unable, or unwilling, to explain why a man who says he is schizophrenic with violent tendencies and says he started to hallucinate during Tuesday's memorial service was allowed to get within arm's length of Obama and other world leaders.

Donovan said prearranged security procedures were in place Tuesday and agents were ""in close proximity,"" a standard security practice wherever the president is. He declined to discuss specific security details of Obama's trip to South Africa.

The Secret Service is charged with keeping the president, vice president and their families safe. And presidential trips, whether across the country or around the world, are meticulously planned with every imaginable detail within the agency's control managed and scheduled.

But once the president leaves the United States, the Secret Service isn't always entirely in control.

Joe Hagin, a former deputy White House Chief of Staff for former President George W. Bush, said that to some degree the Secret Service is at the mercy of a host government.

""There's a lot of diplomacy involved in one of these trips,"" said Hagin, now a partner at Command Consulting Group in Washington. ""The White House is very demanding. But there's a fine line in what you can demand and what you can't.""

Hagin said some security issues are simply nonnegotiable, including allowing the president to ride in any vehicle that hasn't been flown in by the Secret Service. The Secret Service also won't allow the president to leave his security detail.

""You manage the risks; you can never fully mitigate them,"" Hagin said.

It was apparent from Obama's arrival in South Africa that security was not up to Secret Service standards. Roadways are typically shut down for the president's motorcade. But the highway between the military base where Air Force One landed and the suburban Johannesburg hotel where he spent time before the memorial service was filled with morning rush hour traffic, forcing the motorcade at times to slow to a crawl.

If Secret Service officials aren't satisfied with security protocols for a foreign trip, the agency can and has advised against going, said Joseph LaSorsa, a retired Secret Service agent.

Hagin said that was the case when then President Ronald Reagan wanted to travel to Egypt for the funeral of Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated in Cairo in 1981.

""Reagan wanted to go and the Secret Service said no,"" said Hagin, who also worked in the White House under Reagan.

When Pope John Paul II died in Rome in 2005, Hagin said, the decision to have Bush travel to the Vatican was ""an easy one.""

LaSorsa, who is now a security consultant, said if anyone is to blame for allowing Jantjie on the dais Tuesday, it is the South African government staff member who selected him.

""I don't really see this as a Secret Service issue. It just highlights the risk of international travel,"" Hagin said.

Washington and Paris say forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were behind the attack in which more than 1,400 are estimated to have been killed, and that they are considering air strikes to try to deter him from using such weapons again. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relevant countries should ""think thrice"" before acting and exercise ""extreme caution"". "" should return to the United Nations Security Council framework to seek consensus and appropriately handle the Syria issue,"" Wang told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in a telephone call late on Sunday night. China and the United States should take the lead in upholding the U.N. charter to ""preserve and protect the basic norms of international relations and oppose any use of chemical weapons"", Wang said, according to a statement on the Foreign Ministry's website. The remarks come after Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Barack Obama at a G20 summit in Russia on Friday that a military strike could not solve the problem and that a political solution was the correct way out. China has repeatedly called for an impartial investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors into the attack in Syria, and has warned against pre-judging the results. It has also said that whoever used chemical weapons had to be held accountable. U.N. inspectors are likely to hand in their report later this week while the U.S. Congress debates whether to allow limited strikes on Syria. French President Francois Hollande, increasingly under pressure at home and among European partners to seek a U.N. mandate before any military intervention in Syria, suggested on Saturday he could seek a resolution at the Security Council despite previous Russian and Chinese vetoes. Kerry said the White House is ""listening carefully"" to Hollande's comments, but that Obama had not made a decision. Chinese state media said on Monday Obama's ""all-guns-blazing campaign to lobby"" for armed intervention did not hold up and that a military strike on Syria would be a violation of international law. ""It is high time to let reason prevail over recklessness,"" the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary, which reflects official thinking. Apart from its Security Council veto, China has also been keen to show it is not taking sides and has urged the Syrian government to talk to the opposition and take steps to meet demands for political change. It has said a transitional government should be formed. (Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Paul Tait)"

Loiko Has Covered Wars', 'Crises', 'Daily Life In Russia', 'The Former Soviet States For The Los Angeles Times Since']",Kremlin: Edward Snowden revokes request for Russian asylum,"MOSCOW -- Edward Snowden has withdrawn an application for asylum in Russia, apparently deciding that he couldn’t abide by President Vladimir Putin’s insistence that he stop leaking U.S. secrets, a Kremlin spokesman said Tuesday.

“True, Snowden did voice a request [to be allowed] to stay in Russia,” presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “At the same time, having found out yesterday about Russia’s position outlined by President Putin ... he rejected his intention and his request to get a chance to stay in Russia.”

The Kremlin spokesman reiterated Putin’s position, announced Monday, that the former U.S. National Security Agency contractor must stop activities “aimed at damaging our American partners” if he wanted to be granted asylum in Russia.

“As far as we know he is not going to give those up,” Peskov said.

Putin also said that, regardless of Snowden’s application, Russia would not turn him over to U.S. authorities for prosecution.

According to the WikiLeaks organization, which is helping Snowden, the fugitive has applied for asylum in 20 other countries. Among them, according to WikiLeaks, is Venezuela, whose president, Nicolas Maduro, was wrapping up a two-day visit to Moscow on Tuesday. There has been speculation that Maduro might allow Snowden to accompany him back to Caracas.

However, Maduro told reporters that he was not aware of an asylum request. He said that instead of taking Snowden home with him, he would return to Venezuela with “numerous agreements related to investments in the oil and gas sphere.”

At the same time Maduro -- a persistent critic of the United States who has inherited the mantle of the late President Hugo Chavez -- praised Snowden for telling “the big truth to prevent wars.”

The other countries listed by WikiLeaks were: Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Spain and Switzerland.

Most of those countries have extradition agreements with the United States.

Leonid Kalashnikov, deputy head of the foreign relations committee of the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said that Putin, like his counterpart in Ecuador, doesn’t want to quarrel with the United States over Snowden.

“The way the Kremlin presents it, Putin wants to save face before the nations by not bowing to the United States. But at the same time, he doesn’t want to sacrifice what positive aspects still remain in U.S.–Russian relations over the fugitive,” Kalashnikov said. “I am very sorry for Snowden, who keeps being rejected by the countries he was counting on for protection.”

“His situation is dire but not hopeless, as the Kremlin will now do its best to find a safe place for him in a third country,” Kalashnikov added. “The Kremlin can’t afford to risk Snowden being intercepted by the United States in the process, because then Moscow will discredit itself in the eyes of the rest of the world.”

Gordon'],"U.S. Will Ease Sanctions if Iran Halts Nuclear Program, Official Says","But while the atmospherics in the talks have improved, administration officials are concerned that the window for negotiations may close if some way is not found to freeze Iran’s nuclear program. Some experts say it has already advanced to the point that it has the technological capability to make a bomb.

Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview that Iran had the technical know-how and sufficient quantities of uranium enriched to 20 percent to produce a crude nuclear explosive in two or three months if it made the political decision to become a nuclear weapons state. It would take considerably longer for Iran to develop the means of delivering such an explosive by a ballistic missile, he added, but the nuclear threshold would have been crossed.

At the same time, American lawmakers have reacted to advances in Iran’s program by considering the imposition of even tougher economic sanctions, which Obama administration officials fear might harm the climate for negotiations.

“We’re looking for ways to put additional time on the clock,” said the administration official, who declined to be identified publicly under the administration’s diplomatic protocol for briefing reporters.

American officials would not provide details of the steps they wanted Iran to take to halt its nuclear program. But the administration official said such steps would cover the level of enrichment, Iran’s stockpiles of nuclear material and the capabilities of Iran’s nuclear facilities as well as verification. Just how long the suspension would last also remains to be negotiated, but six months is one time frame that has been discussed."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/world/asia/biden-peers-into-north-korea-at-tense-border.html,2013-12-08 00:00:00,['Mark Landler'],Biden Looks Into North Korea at Border,"According to American officials, the Iranian nuclear deal, negotiated with major-power partners that included China, has made Mr. Xi somewhat open to the argument that pressure, combined with an offer of dialogue, can be a recipe for new diplomacy with North Korea.

The Chinese did not release details about the meeting.

There have been signs that China is losing patience with North Korea, which under Mr. Kim has often been dismissive of China’s warnings about provocations that could destabilize the region. In September, China announced that it planned to strengthen export controls on materials and equipment for the country’s nuclear programs. Mr. Xi, officials said, is also more assertive about pressing North Korea than was his predecessor, Hu Jintao.

But significant gaps remain. China continues to invest in North Korea and has resisted some past efforts to impose punishing sanctions. Chinese officials also continue to call for the United States to return to multilateral talks with North Korea, which the Obama administration has resisted until the North takes concrete steps to dismantle the country’s nuclear programs.

Iran, the American official cautioned, is not a “strict template” for North Korea because the North already possesses nuclear weapons, while Iran, which says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, is still short of that threshold.

In the case of Iran, the six major powers negotiating with it have been unified on the use of escalating oil and financial sanctions to drag it to the bargaining table; Iran’s leaders recently agreed to freeze elements of its nuclear program temporarily while both sides search for a comprehensive agreement. In the case of the so-called six-party talks with North Korea, however, China remains an outlier. The other parties involved are Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States.

American officials said China had watched the recent reports of a purge in North Korea with concern, especially since the relative who is said to have lost his state and party positions is a man with whom Chinese leaders have built a relationship.

American officials would not discuss what the Chinese told Mr. Biden about reports that Mr. Kim relieved his powerful uncle, Jang Song-thaek, of his posts and executed two of his aides. Mr. Jang is married to the sister of Mr. Kim’s deceased father, Kim Jong-il."

The 2009 document, a memorandum of understanding between the NSA and its Israeli counterpart, says the U.S. government regularly hands over intercepted communications that have not first been reviewed by U.S. analysts and therefore may contain phone calls and emails of American citizens.

The agreement allows for the possibility that intercepts given to Israel might include the communications of U.S. government officials, in which case Israel is supposed to destroy them immediately. Other data on U.S. citizens who aren’t in the government, however, can be kept by Israel for up to a year, according to the document, first published Wednesday by Britain’s Guardian newspaper.

NSA officials declined to answer questions but issued a statement saying, “Whenever we share intelligence information, we comply with all applicable rules, including the rules to protect U.S. person information.”

It’s no secret that the U.S. and Israel cooperate closely against intelligence targets of mutual interest, such as Syria and Iran. But providing Israel unfiltered electronic intelligence feeds raises questions about why American officials would trust Israel to respect the privacy of U.S. citizens.

The practice also raises the specter of Israel using U.S. intelligence to carry out operations of which the U.S. disapproves. The Obama administration has condemned, for example, the assassinations of several Iranian nuclear scientists that many analysts believe Israel had a hand in.

“One of the biggest concerns in all intelligence-sharing relationships is that the partner would use the data to take action that would result in killing somebody or doing something outside the scope of what our government might consider appropriate,” said a former senior NSA official, who, like others interviewed, asked not to be named in discussing classified information. “The worry is they might go off and bomb somebody and assassinate somebody.”

A second former senior U.S. intelligence official said the sort of intercepts shared with Israel would focus on communications in the Middle East and would not include many Americans. But almost any eavesdropping anywhere in the world tends to capture at least some American communication, the former official said. The former officials requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing intelligence.

The implications are unsettling, said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “You can imagine a scenario in which somebody tries to get on a plane and is told by some foreign airline, ‘We have you on a list,’” or you try to get a visa and you’re told, ‘Unfortunately we can’t give you one,’” he said.

The agreement requires Israel to consult an NSA liaison officer when it comes across data on Americans, and to adhere to U.S. rules for handling U.S. citizen information that are designed to protect privacy, a process known as “minimization.” That would include, for example, blacking out the names of any Americans in intelligence reports derived from the intercepts. But it’s unclear how that requirement is monitored or enforced because the agreement expressly states that it is not legally binding.

Advertisement

The sharing of raw intercepts with Israel is particularly notable because U.S. officials say Israel aggressively seeks to spy on the U.S. government, unlike Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, allies who are part of a long-standing agreement to share signals intelligence with the United States.

Jonathan Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, is serving a life sentence in prison after being caught spying for Israel in the 1980s. Secret U.S. intelligence budget documents revealed last month by Snowden list Israel as one of the most aggressive countries seeking to spy on the U.S., alongside China, Russia, Iran and Cuba.

Advertisement

The Guardian quoted from other NSA documents it did not publish in which U.S. officials expressed concern about the intelligence-sharing arrangement, citing their worry about trusting Israel.

“One of NSA’s biggest threats is actually from friendly intelligence services, like Israel,” an unnamed NSA official is quoted as writing in one document. “There are parameters on what NSA shares with them, but the exchange is so robust, we sometimes share more than we intended.”

Advertisement

The reason that risks are taken with Israel, the second former official said, is because Israel and the U.S. have many mutual foreign policy interests, and Israel in some cases has greater expertise in Middle Eastern languages and cultures.

“Managing the intel-sharing relationship is always kind of a quid pro quo,” the official said. “One country may have access to certain communications that we can’t otherwise get, so there are decisions made at fairly high levels whether or not it’s worth it to share.”

Kerry expressed hope the new Iranian government would provide information on the whereabouts of the 65-year-old Robert Levinson and pushed back on the argument that the U.S. has stopped looking for the retired FBI agent.

“To suggest that we have abandoned him or anybody has abandoned him is simply incorrect, and not helpful,"" he told ABC’s “This Week.” “I think the Iranian government has the ability to help us here, and we hope they will.""

Meanwhile, Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Levinson is not being held by the government and that he has “no idea” about who might have him.

Still, Zarif said his country “will certainly discuss” Levinson’s return should he be found.

The Associated Press reported last week that Levinson was working for the CIA to investigate the Iranian government, amid the U.S.’ longstanding position that he was a private citizen who traveled to an Iranian island on business.

Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain raised doubts Sunday about how much Iran knows about Levinson but said he was confident that his country is doing all it can to learn what has happened.

He also suggested on CNN’s “State of Union” that the Obama administration has not been totally forthcoming with information about Levinson and that the CIA “did not tell the truth to the Congress"" about the ordeal.

Kerry acknowledged the lack of progress in finding Levinson, who was last known to be on an unauthorized CIA mission on the Iranian island in 2007.

“There hasn't been progress in the sense that we don't have him back,"" he said. ""We're looking for proof of life. We're working on several processes that I'm not free to talk about. But there are a number of different channels that are being worked aggressively. … I can't tell you what happened or how the sequence was.”

On Friday, Levinson's family released a statement on the situation.

""Bob is a courageous man who has dedicated himself, including risking his own life, in service to the U.S. government,"" the statement read. ""But the U.S. government has failed to make saving this good man's life the priority it should be. There are those in the U.S. government who have done their duty in their efforts to find Bob, but there are those who have not.""

In March 2007, Levinson flew to Kish Island, an Iranian resort awash with tourists, smugglers and organized crime figures. Days later, after an arranged meeting with an admitted killer, he checked out of his hotel, slipped into a taxi and vanished.

In an extraordinary breach of the most basic CIA rules, a team of analysts -- with no authority to run spy operations – paid Levinson to gather intelligence from some of the world’s darkest corners.

The CIA was slow to respond to Levinson’s disappearance and spent the first several months denying any involvement. When Congress eventually discovered what happened, one of the biggest scandals in recent CIA history erupted.

Behind closed doors, three veteran analysts were forced out of the agency and seven others were disciplined. The CIA paid Levinson’s family $2.5 million to pre-empt a revealing lawsuit, and the agency rewrote its rules restricting how analysts can work with outsiders.

But even after White House, FBI and State Department officials learned of Levinson’s CIA ties, the official story remained unchanged.

Details of the unusual disappearance were described in documents obtained or reviewed by the AP, plus interviews over several years with dozens of current and former U.S. and foreign officials close to the search for Levinson. Nearly all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive case."

Pollak'],Clarence Page Points to Obama's Hypocrisy on Syria,"Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page is one of President Barack Obama’s more reliable defenders–or, more accurately, a reliable critic of Obama’s critics. Yet Page asks a key question in his column Sunday: “Would a younger Obama vote for his new military action?” The answer, Page suggests throughout, is “no”–and highlights the hypocrisy in Obama’s stance.

Noting broad public and congressional opposition to a Syria strike, Page recounts how Obama built his political reputation and his presidential campaign on his vehement opposition to the Iraq War, which was then being justified to the public by President George W. Bush in terms similar to those that Obama is using to justify military action in Syria today:

In a speech at a Chicago anti-war rally in October 2002 that would prove pivotal to his 2008 presidential rise, Obama, than an Illinois state senator, famously made a case against President George W. Bush’s Iraq War that ironically describes why so many people oppose Obama’s proposed Syria attack. He did not oppose all wars, Obama forcefully pointed out, but he opposed “a dumb war. A rash war.” No question that Saddam Hussein was “a brutal man,” said Obama back then, “… who butchers his own people to secure his own power.” But Obama also pointed out that Saddam “… poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States.”… The circumstances in Syria are different. Iraq, for example, did not have the weapons of mass destruction that our bogus intelligence reports said they had. By contrast, on Aug. 21 a poison-gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus, Syria’s capital, killed more than 1,400 civilians. But the “clear rationale,” clear goals and “strong international support” that separates smart policy from “dumb” wars is lacking….

Page goes on to note that Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made a poor case in the Senate and House last week, particularly in their fumbling attempts to reassure elected officials that the limited strike that Obama seeks on Syria will not lead to “mission creep” that takes the U.S., unprepared, to a boots-on-the-ground war.

“Team Obama did not want to speculate about that. But those are the kind of questions I think Sen. Obama would have asked,” he concludes."

In a lengthy and wide-ranging email message, Mullah Mohammad Omar called on Afghans to boycott elections scheduled for early 2014 and urged Afghan police, soldiers and paramilitary personnel to turn their guns on foreign troops -- as well as Afghan government troops cooperating with U.S.-led coalition forces.

In a separate development, individual members of the Afghan High Peace Council -- a group appointed by President Hamid Karzai to negotiate with Taliban elements -- said Tuesday they’ve held secret talks with the Taliban to try to bring momentum to a peace process that’s foundered since its inception.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the statements were a deliberate lie designed to upstage his group’s important Eid message. “The High Peace Council wants to keep its office open and money flowing, which is why they are spouting such propaganda,” Mujahid said. “We don’t intend to talk with the puppet Kabul government. We don’t have contact with them, not individual talks, not group talks.”

The one-eyed Omar, who has a $10-million bounty on his head, has made a practice in recent years of distributing a message shortly before Eid al-Fitr, a three-day Islamic holiday celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan when devout Muslims pray and fast.

Omar said in the five-page letter that the Taliban recently set up an office in Doha, the capital of Qatar, to hasten the departure of foreign forces from Afghanistan and to form an inclusive government based on “Islamic principles.”

“We do not think of monopolizing power,” he wrote. “Those who truly love Islam and the country and have commitment to both ... this homeland is theirs.”

Omar also welcomed humanitarian organizations to Afghanistan as long as they don’t push “non-Islamic ways” on Afghans. In May, a suicide attack on the Red Cross compound in Jalalabad was widely condemned and prompted the aid group to pull back on its operations in Afghanistan. The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack, in which an Afghan guard was killed.

Omar’s message was particularly critical of the planned 2014 elections, which he called a “deceiving drama” all but decided in Washington. “Participation in such elections is only a waste of time, nothing more,” he said.

His stance is consistent with the Taliban’s attitude toward past Afghan elections, during which the group directed gunmen to target candidates and block roads leading to polling stations.

Omar’s message, tone and arguments suggest the group is out of touch, some analysts said. “As always, they’re trying to fuel panic and fear in people with this message,” said Abdul Wahid Taqat, a Kabul-based military analyst. “They know they’re not popular and couldn’t win an election, so they boycott.”

The group’s relatively welcoming message to international humanitarian groups is an attempt to win popularity among ordinary people that won’t work, Taqat added.

“If the Taliban respected humanitarian organizations, it wouldn’t kill innocent women and children every day,” he said. “These people don’t respect humanity, children, religion and Islam, how they can welcome humanitarian organizations? Whatever Mullah Omar has said in his Eid message is baseless.”

Members of Karzai’s inner circle said they’d held discreet discussions with the militant group on the possible framework for more formal peace talks. “There have been individual talks with the Taliban,” said Habibullah Fauzi, a High Peace Council member. “Talks have taken place many times.”

The opening of a Taliban political office in June in Qatar was mired in controversy, with Karzai highly critical of the office’s sign, flag and name, which he said was falsely meant to suggest that the group was a legitimate national representative.

Omar, who is suspected of living in Pakistan, has made no public appearances or speeches since he fled Afghanistan in late 2001 after U.S. forces invaded and toppled the Taliban. Afghanistan’s de facto head of state from 1996 to 2001, he is considered the Taliban’s spiritual leader.

Despite his elevated status within the militant group, relatively little is known about him other than descriptions that he’s tall, shy and reluctant to speak with foreigners.

But by attributing such an order to its top leader, North Korea tried to add weight to its threat.

“We believe they are taking follow-up steps,” said Kim Min-seok, spokesman of the South Korean Defense Ministry, referring to increased activities of the North Korean military units. ""South Korean and American intelligence authorities are closely watching whether North Korea is preparing its short, medium, and long-range missiles, including its Scud, Rodong and Musudan.”

He did not elaborate. But government officials and South Korean media said that there had been a surge in vehicle and troop movements at North Korean missile units in recent days as the United States and South Korea has been conducting joint military drills. The national news agency Yonhap quoted an anonymous military source as saying that North Korean vehicles had been moving to Tongchang-ri near the North’s western border with China, where its Unha-3 rocket blasted off in December.

North Korea might be preparing for an engine test ahead of a long-range rocket test, the source was quoted as saying. Scud and Rodong are the North's mainstay short- and medium-range missiles. The Musudan, deployed around 2007 and displayed for the first time during a military parade in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, in 2010, is a road-mobile intermediate-range ballistic missile with a range of more than 1,900 miles, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.

In an angry reaction to the sanctions that the United Nations imposed after North Korea’s launching of a three-stage rocket in December and its third nuclear test last month, the North has repeatedly threatened to strike Washington, as well as the American military bases around the Pacific and in South Korea, with nuclear-armed long-range missiles."

USA TODAY

When President Obama calls a foreign leader, the White House and the other country often release readouts of the conversation -- and sometimes they are very different.

Take Monday's call between Obama and French President Francois Hollande about news reports that the National Security Agency has conducted intelligence gathering in France.

The Hollande readout was much more critical.

Olivier Knox of Yahoo News, who translated the French statement, pointed out some of the differences in tone.

For example, the White House readout says: ""The United States and France are allies and friends, and share a close working relationship on a wide range of issues, including security and intelligence.""

The French readout: ""The Head of State shared his deep disapproval regarding these practices, which are unacceptable between allies and friends, because they violate the privacy of French citizens.""

A French newspaper said the NSA gathered more than 70 million French phone records during a recent 30-day period.

Also from the two readouts:

The United States said that Obama and Hollande ""discussed recent disclosures in the press -- some of which have distorted our activities and some of which raise legitimate questions for our friends and allies about how these capabilities are employed.""

The French said Hollande asked Obama for ""a full accounting (of the reported spying) as well as all of the information that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden might have in his possession.""

From Yahoo News:

""It's not unusual for world leaders to stress different aspects of a telephone conversation, but even by those standards the conversation prompted by Snowden's latest leaks is remarkable.

""Shocked, shocked France is hardly a stranger to spying — experts say Paris developed its sizeable nuclear arsenal by stealing U.S. atomic secrets. And its networks across Africa and the Middle East share valuable information with their American counterparts, U.S. officials say. ...

In Syria, the answer appears to be right about now, at least from the Obama administration’s perspective.

Which brings us to the obvious follow-up question: Then what?

The administration appears convinced that President Bashar Assad’s government used chemical weapons in a large-scale attack on civilians, crossing a “red line” that President Obama drew some months ago. Even opponents of U.S. involvement in Syria -- including The Times’ editorial board -- have acknowledged that the use of chemical weapons is intolerable. In order to deter the use of such toxins, anyone who takes such a desperate step has to suffer consequences.

In Assad’s case, though, the only thing he values is his hold on the Syrian government. The same probably could be said of any despot who gasses opponents; it’s the tactic of someone desperately clinging to power. That means the only consequence that matters is one that removes that hold.

My colleague Ken Dilanian had an instructive piece Tuesday that underlines this point. The carefully calibrated punishments meted out on despots and terrorists in past years by the United States haven’t done much to change their behavior; witness the airstrikes on Iraqi weapons facilities in 1998, which didn’t exactly rein in Saddam Hussein. Even former Libyan strongman Moammar Kadafi, who was supposedly scared straight by airstrikes on his living quarters in 1986, was still supporting terrorist attacks such as the one that blew up a commercial airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.

The United States has gained plenty of experience in deposing governments in recent years, often at an enormous cost for all concerned. And while we’ve been quite effective when it comes to removing heads of state, we’ve had mixed results at best when it comes to installing stable replacements.

In Syria, it’s conceivable that the United States could limit its response to delivering a blow to Assad’s military that’s so damaging, he can’t hold off the opposition forces. I’m not sure what that would look like, but it might involve a sustained air campaign against Assad’s heavy weaponry, air force and air defenses.

Just for the sake of argument, let’s assume we could do that and then stand back while Syrian rebels gradually wear down Assad’s forces. We would be making a statement about the use of chemical weapons, but in the end, Syria would be taken over by ... who knows? That’s one of the reasons the Obama administration has been so hesitant to throw in with the rebels.

And still, if the United States doesn’t respond to Assad gassing a rebel city -- should that war crime be confirmed -- what’s to stop the next dictator from (literally) putting down the opposition with toxins? Every nation around the globe has an interest in keeping that particularly nasty genie trapped in a bottle, and not just for humanitarian reasons. The more such weapons creep toward respectability, the more they will be produced, which means the easier they will be for terrorists and anti-democratic forces to find through black-market channels.

The death toll from Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons -- about 350, according to Doctors Without Borders -- is a tiny fraction of the German civilians killed when Allied forces in World War II firebombed Dresden, or the Japanese civilians killed by U.S. atomic weapons, or the Jewish civilians killed in Nazi concentration camps. Happily, the world has come to view (and the Geneva Conventions confirm) that civilians are not legitimate targets. The fact that the death toll in Syria hasn’t reached the proportions of yore is no reason to shrug it off; doing so would just ensure that the civilian casualties rise.

Nor is it much help to note how many more civilians have died in Syria from conventional weapons. As much as we might like to deter civil wars, the United States’ interests really kick in when forces resort to weapons of mass destruction.

So the case for doing something seems clear. What that action should be, however, is anything but.

Israel is asking the Obama administration not to arm Syrian rebels unless it can carefully screen them to ensure no weapons would fall into the hands of terrorists groups, the Israeli ambassador to the United States tells CNN.

""If it were decided to provide lethal assistance, we ask those groups be carefully vetted,"" Ambassador Michael Oren said Wednesday. He declined to offer specifics but broadly indicated the matter has come up in recent weeks - in the general time frame of visits to Israel by President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

Neighboring Jordan and Turkey have expressed similar concerns.



U.S. officials believe that a number of militant groups - including the al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked group - as well as Iranian-backed militias and Hezbollah units are operating in Syria and have even infiltrated the opposition.

The Israelis are particularly concerned that al-Nusra now controls territory near the Israeli border, where it would pose a threat if it gained control of rockets and mortars that might be initially supplied to the opposition.

In making its case to the White House, Israel has also pointed out that after thousands of Libyan weapons went uncontrolled as that regime fell, many turned up in the Sinai and Gaza regions within days, posing a threat to Israel.

U.S. officials have maintained that all options for Syria are on the table but have privately indicated arming the rebels is not something likely to be decided upon soon, in part because of the opposition from neighboring countries.

A senior U.S. official tells CNN that U.S. intelligence personnel have been conducting some ""vetting"" of opposition forces in Jordan and Turkey, but that mainly is being to facilitate the receipt of non-lethal aid and to conduct some limited training."

Pakistani officials said that they were releasing seven Taliban prisoners to facilitate the peace process, while Afghan officials said they had requested the releases and welcomed the move.

Afghan officials complained, however, that Pakistani officials had backed down on the expected release of one Taliban prisoner, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, formerly the top military commander of the insurgents’ movement. Afghan officials have long sought Mr. Baradar’s release, viewing him as crucial to restarting peace talks.

Separately, Afghan officials confirmed Saturday that the day before they had exchanged 11 Taliban prisoners to obtain the release of a female member of the Afghan Parliament, who had been kidnapped by the insurgents last month, according to an Afghan official involved in the prisoner exchange, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media."

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-cancels-putin-summit-amid-snowden-tensions-201838010.html,,[],Obama cancels Putin summit amid Snowden tensions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Already faltering, President Barack Obama's five-year effort to reboot U.S.-Russian relations finally crashed Wednesday, as the White House abruptly canceled his planned face-to-face summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

The effort to upgrade the relationship has fallen victim to the rapidly shrinking common ground between the former Cold War rivals, including extreme differences over the Syrian civil war, Russia's domestic crackdown on civil rights and — the final straw — the asylum granted to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

The U.S. and Russian foreign and defense ministers will sit down in Washington later this week, but Obama canceled his planned early September summit in Moscow with Putin because of what the White House called a lack of ""recent progress"" on a wide array of critical issues. Such steps are not taken lightly, and the decision will almost certainly herald a new frostiness in already chilly ties.

""We have informed the Russian government that we believe it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared agenda,"" the White House said in a statement, citing deep differences over missile defense, arms control, trade, global security and human rights. ""Russia's disappointing decision to grant Edward Snowden temporary asylum was also a factor that we considered in assessing the current state of our bilateral relationship,"" it added.

The Kremlin responded quickly, voicing its own disappointment with the canceled summit and blaming it on Washington's inability to develop relations with Moscow on an ""equal basis."" Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, added that the decision was ""clearly linked"" to the Snowden case, a situation that he said wasn't of Russia's making.

While Snowden might have been the immediate catalyst for canceling the summit, the seeds of renewed U.S.-Russia discord were planted more than a year ago when Putin re-took the Russian presidency. On returning to power, he adopted a deeply nationalistic and more openly confrontational stance toward the United States than had his chosen successor Dmitry Medvedev, whose 2008-2012 tenure roughly overlapped Obama's first term in the White House.

Story continues

Where Medvedev abstained in a U.N. Security Council vote that authorized NATO airstrikes in Libya, Putin has refused repeated entreaties from Washington to allow the world body to impose even minimal sanctions on President Bashar Assad's Syria. At the same time, Putin's government has continued to supply its ally Assad with weapons. And it has not delivered on pledges to coax Assad into sending representatives to talks with the opposition aimed at finding a political solution to the Syrian conflict.

Obama sought to cultivate Medvedev as a friend of the United States, making significant changes to Bush administration plans for European missile defense to try to ease Russian concerns about that project, signing a new arms control treaty and famously sending then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva where she proclaimed a ""reset"" in U.S.-Russia relations.

Putin, however, seems to want none of the coziness that a ""reset"" would bring and has actively sought to undo previous agreements on cooperation. Under Putin, Russia has stepped up its negative rhetoric on missile defense, ended two decades of democracy and civil society training by the U.S. Agency for International Development and banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans.

Andrew Kuchins, a political scientist and expert on Russian politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said he thinks the reset has been on hold for a while.

""We hit the peak at the end of 2010, and then things started going downhill gradually in 2011,"" Kuchins said. ""Then, when the announcement was made that Putin was coming back as president in the fall of 2011, the downfall of the reset got a little steeper. ""

But he said he does not think that Putin wants to ""trash"" the U.S.-Russia relationship and doesn't think relations are as bad as they were after the Georgia war in the fall of 2008 and 2009. In 2008, Georgia and Russia fought a brief war after Georgia launched an intense artillery barrage on the capital of South Ossetia, and Mikhail Saakashvili, the president of the former Soviet republic, forged a deeper relationship with the U.S.

""That was a pretty dangerous moment for the relationship,"" Kuchins said. ""Right now, I don't see such a dangerous moment in the relationship, but we have some fundamental disagreements on nuclear security, missile defense, Syria. I don't think the Russians are taking positions just to counter us, undermine us. But they have some fundamental differences. They have a different way of looking at some things.""

Ivo Daalder, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and now president of The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said some positive steps have come from the reset, including Russia's willingness to help the U.S. transport military materiel in and out of Afghanistan.

""There still is cooperation on areas like Iran where Russia voted four times in the U.N. Security Council to impose new sanctions,"" Daalder said. ""There is cooperation on North Korea — Russia has voted for new sanctions. And those are material, positive steps in the relationship that have been the result of the reset.""

But he said that a reset also suggests a future relationship and that despite meetings Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and former National Security Adviser Tom Donilon have had with Russian officials, there has been little progress on Syria, nuclear arms reduction and missile defense issues.

In April, Obama asked Donilon to hand-deliver a letter to Putin, proposing new ways to cooperate. Ushakov, Putin's foreign affairs adviser, said Obama's letter was ""quite constructive"" and contained specific proposals regarding arms control and economic cooperation.

But Daalder said Russia's responses to the letter have been ""either nonexistent or negative.""

Putin and Obama last met in June, on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of Eight industrial nations.

Putin said then that he believed the U.S. and Russia had an ""opportunity to move forward on most sensitive directions.""

Obama said then that the two nations were poised to increase trade and investment and had pledged to continue to work together to counter potential threats of proliferation and to enhance nuclear security.

""I think this is an example of the kind of constructive, cooperative relationship that moves us out of a Cold War mindset,"" Obama said.

That was just seven weeks ago.

On Tuesday, a day before he canceled his meeting with Putin, Obama said on NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" that there have been times where the Russians ""slip back into Cold War thinking and a Cold War mentality.""

http://news.yahoo.com/analysis-obama-lobbies-personally-syria-vote-223628615.html,,[],Analysis: Obama lobbies personally for Syria vote,"By Jeff Mason and Richard Cowan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After putting a decision to launch military strikes on Syria into the hands of Congress, President Barack Obama is doing what his critics have long accused him of failing to do: reaching out, personally and aggressively, to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. While top lieutenants including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry lobby their former congressional colleagues, Obama is making individual calls himself to members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to press his case for action. What Obama has not done since he made his announcement on Saturday is appeal to the public, which both Democrats and Republicans say will be crucial as polls show little enthusiasm for U.S. military action anywhere. The stakes for the president are high - and the arguments being made in support of a 'yes' vote from Congress are making them even higher. A vote against strikes to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for alleged use of chemical weapons, officials argue, could undermine Obama's standing in the Middle East as his administration seeks to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, broker peace between Israelis and Palestinians and stabilize a region already in turmoil. ""A rejection of this resolution would be catastrophic, not just for him but for the institution of the presidency and the credibility of the United States,"" Senator John McCain said after meeting with Obama at the White House on Monday. Mindful of those stakes, the White House has employed a ""flood the zone"" strategy, according to an administration official, using an American football term for an offensive move where players flood an area of the field to overwhelm the opposing team's defenders. The evidence of that strategy: an onslaught of briefings, calls and meetings with lawmakers from both political parties. On Monday National Security adviser Susan Rice, Kerry, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and the top U.S. military officer, Martin Dempsey, held an unclassified briefing call for Democratic House members, and Obama met with McCain and fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. On Tuesday Obama will meet with the chairs of key national security committees in Congress and Kerry, Dempsey, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel will testify to the Senate foreign relations committee. ""In all calls and briefings, we will be making the same fundamental case: The failure to take action against Assad unravels the deterrent impact of the international norm against chemical weapons use,"" a senior administration official said. ""It risks emboldening Assad and his key allies - Hezbollah and Iran - who will see that there are no consequences for such a flagrant violation of an international norm. Anyone who is concerned about Iran and its efforts in the region should support this action,"" he said. CONSULTATION, AFTER THE FACT Obama has stepped up his interactions with lawmakers this year, holding dinners and building relationships that critics say he lacked. But any goodwill he has obtained from that effort is limited, and one Republican aide noted on Monday that Obama had only come to Congress after already articulating a decision that strikes were necessary. ""They're certainly doing more, but it's after the fact. They already made a decision on what they want to do,"" a senior Senate Republican aide told Reuters. Running parallel to the White House contacts with Congress are conversations that senior Democratic and Republican senators are holding in an attempt to get a resolution passed in the full Senate. The aide said the Democratic chairmen of relevant Senate committees were consulting with the highest-ranking Republicans on those panels to try to work out language that could pass the Senate next week. Passage in the Republican-controlled House remains much more problematic, with lawmakers expressing skepticism about U.S. involvement in another war as well as the effectiveness of the limited strikes that Obama has proposed.

In some of the most aggressive language used yet by the administration, Mr. Kerry accused the Syrian government of the “indiscriminate slaughter of civilians” and of cynical efforts to cover up its responsibility for a “cowardly crime.”

Mr. Kerry’s remarks at the State Department reinforced the administration’s toughening stance on the Syria conflict, which is now well into its third year, and indicated that the White House was moving closer to a military response in consultation with America’s allies.

Administration officials said that although President Obama had not made a final decision on military action, he was likely to order a limited military operation — cruise missiles launched from American destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea at military targets in Syria, for example — and not a sustained air campaign intended to topple Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, or to fundamentally alter the nature of the conflict on the ground."

Having announced over the weekend that he'll seek congressional approval for military strikes against the Assad regime, the Obama administration is now trying to rally support among Americans and persuade members of Congress with an array of views on Syria.

Sen. John McCain, Obama's White House opponent in 2008, will be joined for the talks later Monday by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who like McCain has argued that Obama must not only punish the Syrian regime with surgical missile strikes but must seek to change the course of the civil war and oust President Bashar Assad from power.

Obama has said he wants limited military action to respond to an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that the U.S. says included sarin gas and killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of whom were children.

McCain and Graham, both Republicans, represent the most aggressive faction in Congress and have called on Obama to launch more comprehensive strikes with an aim of destroying President Bashar Assad's air power, his military command and control, Syria's ballistic missiles, and other military targets while at the same time increasing training and arming of opposition forces.

On the other side of the spectrum, some Republican and Democratic lawmakers don't want to see military action at all.

Members of the House Democratic caucus were to participate in an unclassified conference call Monday with Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The White House is engaging in what officials call a ""flood the zone"" persuasion strategy with Congress, arguing that failure to act against Assad would weaken any deterrence against the use of chemical weapons and could embolden not only Assad but also Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Story continues

Obama's turnabout decision to seek congressional authority on Syria sets the stage for the biggest foreign policy vote in Congress since the Iraq war.

On Sunday, Kerry said the U.S. received new physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that shows sarin gas was used in the Aug. 21 attack. Kerry said the U.S. must respond with its credibility on the line.

""We know that the regime ordered this attack,"" he said. ""We know they prepared for it. We know where the rockets came from. We know where they landed. We know the damage that was done afterwards.""

On Capitol Hill Sunday, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in private to explain why the U.S. was compelled to act against Assad. Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough also made calls to individual lawmakers.

In addition to Monday's meetings and briefings, further sessions were planned for Tuesday and Wednesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans a meeting Tuesday, according to its chairman, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. The Senate Armed Service Committee will gather a day later, said Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the panel.

""The American people deserve to hear more from the administration about why military action in Syria is necessary, what it will achieve and how it will be sufficiently limited to keep the U.S. from being drawn further into the Syrian conflict,"" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, reflecting a more cautious approach to a military strike.

McCain said Obama asked him to come to the White House specifically to discuss Syria.

""It can't just be, in my view, pinprick cruise missiles,"" the Arizona Republican told CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

In an interview with an Israeli television network, he said Obama has ""encouraged our enemies"" by effectively punting his decision to Congress. He and Graham have threatened to vote against Obama's authorization if the military plan doesn't seek to shift the momentum of the 2 ½ year civil war toward the rebels trying to oust Assad from power.

Obama is trying to convince Americans and the world about the need for action.

So far, he is finding few international partners willing to engage in a conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the past 2½ years and dragged in terrorist groups on both sides of the battlefield.

Only France is firmly on board among the major military powers. Britain's Parliament rejected the use of force in a vote last week.

Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said Monday the information the U.S. showed Moscow to prove the Syrian regime was behind the chemical attack was ""absolutely unconvincing.""

With Navy ships on standby in the eastern Mediterranean ready to launch missiles, Congress on Sunday began a series of meetings that are expected to continue over the next several days in preparation for a vote once lawmakers return from summer break, which is scheduled to end Sept. 9.

Senior administration officials gave a two-hour classified briefing to dozens of members of Congress in the Capitol on Sunday.

Lawmakers expressed a range of opinions coming out of the meeting, from outright opposition to strident support for Obama's request for the authorization to use force.

Among Democrats, Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan said he'd approve Obama's request and predicted it would pass. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland said he was concerned the authorization might be ""too broad."" Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, the senior Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the administration still has ""work to do with respect to shoring up the facts of what happened.""

Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington said she was concerned about what Congress was being asked to approve. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said the war resolution needed tightening.

""I don't think Congress is going to accept it as it is,"" Sessions said.

USA TODAY

Snowden is charged with leaking classified information under the Espionage Act

U.S. lawmakers say Snowden must be returned to USA

Hong Kong said extradition request didn%27t fully comply with Hong Kong law

MOSCOW — NSA leaker Edward Snowden has asked for political asylum in Ecuador after fleeing Hong Kong for Russia, the Ecuador Foreign Ministry said Sunday.

Russian news site RT reported that Snowden was to leave Moscow on Monday for Havana, and then move on to Caracas, Venezuela. But the Ecuador ministry and WikiLeaks, a website that divulges state secrets and is assisting Snowden, said he will try to get to Ecuador instead.

A Russian security source indicated on Monday that Moscow had no basis to extradite Snowden.

""Snowden has not committed any unlawful act on Russian territory,"" RIA Novosti quoted an unnamed security source as saying on Monday morning. ""Russian law enforcement has no order to detain him, so there is no basis to do so.""

Earlier the White House urged Russia to consider ""all options available,"" according to National Security Council Spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden cited by Associated Press.

Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino has confirmed, meanwhile, that Snowden had requested asylum in his country, and pledged that his request would be considered in the shortest time possible, according to televised remarks carried by the Latin-American channel Telesur.

RIA Novosti reported at about 2:00 a.m. Monday morning that Ecuador's Ambassador to Russia, Patricio Alberto Chavez Zavala was seen leaving Sheremetyevo's transit zone, with several people getting into his car.

Interfax reported that Snowden has not been able to leave the airport because he does not have a Russian visa. He was accompanied by WikiLeaks representative Sarah Harrison, a British citizen who does have a Russian visa, according to Interfax.

""(Snowden) is bound for a democratic nation via a safe route for the purposes of asylum,and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisers from WikiLeaks,"" the group said in a statement.

Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, told Australian Sydney Morning Herald that Snowden will be met by ""diplomats from the country that will be his ultimate destination"" in the airport, who'll accompany him on a further flight to his destination.

A Russian lawmaker commented on Monday that the Snowden affair would have little effect on Russia-US relations.

""It won't improve these relations, but it won't harm them,"" RIA Novosti quoted Leonid Kalashnikov, first deputy head of the State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee as saying. Kalashnikov added that Russia should give Snowden citizenship and asylum. ""Why should he fly to Ecuador? This isn't about a political refugee, but about a humanitarian one.""

Snowden was allowed to leave Hong Kong just hours after Obama administration officials announced they filed a formal petition with Chinese authorities seeking Snowden's arrest and return to the United States.

An unofficial intermediary for the Hong Kong government told Edward Snowden that he was free to leave the city, according to Albert Ho, a local legislator who said on Monday that he was part of the former NSA contractor's legal team.

Ho said the message was passed to Snowden after Ho met with a senior government official on Friday to discuss whether Hong Kong would extradite Snowden to the U.S. and whether he might be detained at the airport if he tried to leave on his own.

He said Snowden originally planned to leave Saturday evening, but then hesitated as he tried to confirm the identity of the intermediary who had given him the all clear. Ho said he thought the person might have been an official from the Chinese government.

""I have reasons to believe that ... those who wanted [Snowden] to leave represented Beijing authorities,"" Ho said. ""Beijing would not step foward to the front stage because it would affect Sino-U.S. relations.""

On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder had pressed the request for Snowden's arrest directly with Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen.

A U.S. official told the Associated Press that Snowden's passport was revoked before he left Hong Kong. Hong Kong's immigration department stated that so far no notification has been received from the United States government about the issue.

Snowden's travel plans could be complicated, but airlines or countries are allowed to overlook a withdrawn passport if a senior official so orders, the AP reported.

""We will continue to discuss this matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel,'' U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said Sunday.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said the U.S. government must exhaust all legal options to get Snowden back.

""Every one of those nations is hostile to the United States,"" Rogers, R-Mich., said on NBC's Meet the Press.

""When you think about what he says he wants and what his actions are, it defies logic,"" said Rogers, who repeated his assertion that Snowden's leaks of secret government surveillance programs had damaged U.S. national security.

The Hong Kong government said Snowden, 30, was allowed to fly out ""on his own accord"" because the U.S. extradition request announced Saturday did not fully comply with Hong Kong law.

Hong Kong said in a statement that it allowed Snowden to leave because documents provided by the U.S. government for extradition did not ""fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law,"" and the U.S. had not yet provided the additional information requested to consider the U.S. request for a provisional arrest warrant.

After the announcement Saturday of the extradition request, an Obama administration official told USA TODAY that Hong Kong risked harming relations with the two sides if it did not comply with its legal obligations. Regina Ip, a legislator and Cabinet member in Hong Kong, said, ""I don't think we need to be concerned about any consequences.""

Snowden has been the focus of a criminal investigation since he acknowledged earlier this month that he was the source of materials detailing surveillance programs that collected telephone records for millions of Americans and a separate operation that targeted the Internet communications of non-citizens abroad who were suspected of terrorist connections.

He has been charged in U.S. federal court with espionage.

The South China Morning Post meanwhile reported that Snowden had provided information to show that the NSA had hacked into the Hong Kong system of Pacnet, which runs undersea telecommunications cables around the Pacific, and into 63 computers and servers at Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of China's most elite schools.

""The NSA does all kinds of things like hack Chinese cellphone companies to steal all of your SMS data,"" Snowden told the newspaper.

More:Snowden background check may have been flawed

Snowden, who was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton as an NSA systems analyst in Hawaii, fled to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong last month with top-secret documents and court orders on government surveillance operations.

Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said she was not surprised that Snowden would seek safe haven in Cuba or Venezuela, ""two regimes that have a longstanding history of giving refuge to fugitives from U.S. law.""

""The cruel irony is that there are no press freedoms in either Cuba or Venezuela, yet Snowden who supposedly stands for transparency in government seeks refuge in police states like these two countries,"" she said.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review’s Statisical Yearbook for 2012 says that number is up sharply, with 66% more no-shows than in 2008.

The asylum system appears to be a magnet for abuse by those who make a claim to get into the country and then vanish. As Breitbart News reported, last week one border crossing near San Diego saw a sudden flood of asylum requests that resulted in the checkpoint being shut down.

The numbers from the DoJ indicate a growing crisis in the system the United States uses to grant asylum to international refugees, as the immigration courts are overwhelmed by cases from Mexican immigrants that rarely result in asylum being granted.

In raw numbers, Mexican immigrants made 9,206 asylum claims in 2012 but were only found by the immigration courts to have 126 claims worthy of being granted. Compare those numbers to immigrants from a country like China–often accused of human rights violations–11,197 asylum claims were made, 4,705 of which were granted.

There is no breakdown in the report by nationality for the people who make an asylum claim but don’t bother to show up in court, but in 2012, 29% of all asylum applicants released on bond or their own recognizance were “failure to appears.”

The cost in court time for frivolous claims is also staggering. For the past five years, cases involving Mexican immigrants rank #1 in the amount of immigration court cases completed in terms of both normal decisions and appeals. However, in terms of the number of actual asylums that were granted, Mexico has never ranked higher than #17 and didn’t even make the list of the top 25 grantees from 2008-2010.

Over 65% of the asylum cases completed in the immigration courts in 2012 involved nationals from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, or Guatemala, with Mexicans being the vast majority of all cases completed at 42%. Additionally, 67% of all immigration court proceeding are completed in Spanish.

Syrian National Coalition%27s stand is in direct conflict with the peace talks push by the U.S.

Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Syrian government to attend the proposed peace talks

Iran%2C a chief ally of Syria%27s Bashar Assad regime%2C may attend the negotiations

ISTANBUL — The Syrian opposition said Wednesday it welcomes the promise of increased U.S. involvement in finding a solution to two years of war, but that it would not accept peace talks if top members of the regime of Bashar Assad are involved.

The stand of the country's leading opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, is in direct conflict with the peace talks that the Obama administration are seeking to help organize next month in Geneva.

Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Syrian government Wednesday to attend the proposed peace talks that would also include Russia, a chief patron of Syria that has refused to support rebel demands that Assad be forced out in return for peace.

""We hope the U.S. will lead the international role to solving the conflict,"" said Khaled Saleh, spokesman for the Syria National Coalition. ""The coalition welcomes any solution as long as it meets the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people but it must start with the departure of Assad.""

Saleh repeated that the rebellion needs the United States and other Western nations to impose a no-fly zone over Syria to stop Assad's warplanes as well as strategic military strikes on government positions. Kerry on Wednesday threatened to give non-lethal aid, such as medical kits and food, to the rebels if Assad did not join talks.

The back-and-forth seems to indicate that Kerry's endeavor on behalf of President Obama will satisfy none of the principals involved in the conflict. Kerry met with Arab leaders in Jordan on Wednesday to win backers for the peace talks.

The finer details of the proposed Geneva talks have yet to be ironed out while the presence of Iran, a chief ally of the Assad regime, has not been ruled out. Speaking in Cairo, Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations-Arab League mediator, said that both the opposition and regime are preparing to take part in the conference.

Diplomacy has so far failed to stop the violence in a conflict the United Nations says has cost the lives of more than 80,000 people and forced more than 1 million to flee Syria's borders. SNC members will gather in Istanbul on Thursday for a three-day meeting to elect a president and decide if it will attend the Geneva conference.

Speaking with USA TODAY last week, interim SNC President George Sabra said he held little hope for the joint U.S.-Russian diplomatic effort and would not commit to attending talks before seeing who would be invited from the regime's side. Russia has made statements that Assad's regime was overreaching in its attempts to stay intact, but it has not said it would seek to force the leader out.

""Assad is threatening the entire region as we've seen in Turkey and Lebanon recently and I think Russia is starting to recognize it is making a mistake,"" Saleh said. The (Geneva) conference is an example of that.""

Analysts said the call for talks represents a change in U.S. policy by not insisting that Assad agree to vacate his position immediately.

""The goal of the U.S. is to help bring about a solution by bringing the regime and the opposition together,"" said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. ""This is a major shift — the U.S. no longer insisting on Assad's departure as a precondition to talks.""

""It's important because what John Kerry is trying to do now is to convince America's regional allies and the allies of the opposition, in particular Turkey and Qatar, to at least convene in Geneva and to convince the political opposition to take it seriously and form a negotiating team to go to Geneva,"" he said. ""The U.S. is acting now because it's afraid that war could expand into regional war."""

U.S., Russia reach agreement on seizure of Syrian chemical weapons arsenal

GENEVA — The United States and Russia agreed Saturday on an outline for the identification and seizure of Syrian chemical weapons and said Syria must turn over an accounting of its arsenal within a week.

The agreement will be backed by a U.N. Security Council resolution that could allow for sanctions or other consequences if Syria fails to comply, Secretary of State John F. Kerry said.

Kerry said that the first international inspection of Syrian chemical weapons will take place by November, with destruction to begin next year.

Senior administration officials had said Friday the Obama administration would not press for U.N. authorization to use force against Syria if it reneges on any agreement to give up its chemical weapons.

The Russians had made clear in talks here between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kerry that the negotiations could not proceed under the threat of a U.N. resolution authorizing a military strike. Russia also wanted assurances that a resolution would not refer Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the International Criminal Court for possible war-crimes prosecution.

President Obama has said that the unilateral U.S. use of force against Syria for a chemical attack last month remains on the table. But consideration of that action, already under challenge by a skeptical Congress, has been put on hold pending the outcome of the Geneva talks.

The discussions here began this week following a Russian proposal Monday, quickly agreed to by Assad, to place Syria’s chemical arsenal under international control and eventually destroy it.

Kerry and Lavrov, negotiating behind closed doors with teams of disarmament experts, have said little about the talks that began Thursday. But administration officials in Washington provided some details on the condition that they not be identified or quoted directly.

The officials insisted that any agreement must be verifiable and include consequences for non-compliance. Short of a threatened use of force, it is not clear what those consequences would be.

The question of U.N. authorization for using force in Syria came up less than 24 hours after the Russians first made their proposal. France quickly drafted a resolution that threatened to consider “further necessary measures” — code words for military force — if Syria makes a deal and then breaks it. The draft, negotiated with the United States and Britain, was met with public statements from Lavrov and Russian President Vladi­mir Putin that they would not negotiate under threat.

Washington and London have now backed off the use-of-force provision, and a revised French draft being circulated at the U.N. Security Council has weakened it. Instead, the draft calls for continuous review of “Syria’s compliance . . . and, if Syria does not comply fully, to impose further measures” that are unspecified.

The draft still includes a provision to refer Syrian authorities to the International Criminal Court, but that provision could also be removed in subsequent reworkings as the Geneva negotiations continue.

The senior officials said they expected a U.N. resolution in some form to pass within weeks of a Geneva agreement.

One possible course of action, they said, is the internationally verified transfer of Syria’s chemical stockpiles to Russia, where they eventually would be destroyed.

The Kerry-Lavrov discussions hit snags Friday over ways to ensure all chemical stockpiles are identified, an official familiar with the talks said, but a second official said the two sides were “coming closer to agreement.”

Meeting in Washington with Kuwaiti Emir Sabah Ahmed al-Sabah, Obama said he had told the visiting leader that he hopes the U.S.-Russian discussions “bear fruit.”

“But I repeated what I've said publicly, which is that any agreement needs to be verifiable and enforceable,” Obama said.

Both Kerry and Lavrov called the talks productive, and they will continue Saturday. And they agreed to meet in about two weeks when both will attend the U.N. General Assembly’s annual gathering in New York.

“Now that the Assad government has joined the Chemical Weapons Convention, we have to engage our professionals together” with U.N. officials, Lavrov said Friday, “to design a road which would make sure that this issue is resolved quickly, professionally, as soon as practical.”

Assad sent a letter Thursday to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon saying that on Monday he will sign the international accord banning chemical weapons.

The Geneva talks are aimed at creating a blueprint for identifying and seizing chemical weapons that the United States claims the ruling Syrian government used to gas to death more than 1,400 people last month.

Kerry and Lavrov said successful diplomacy on chemical weapons could help revive negotiations they jointly proposed months ago between the Syrian government and the opposition fighting to unseat Assad.

A possible follow-up peace conference “will obviously depend on the capacity to have success here,” Kerry said after he and Lavrov met Friday morning with Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. and Arab League envoy to Syria.

Syria, which is not a party to the Geneva talks, denied until this week that it had chemical weapons. Under Russian pressure, Assad agreed to acknowledge the stockpiles and join the international weapons ban. Both Syria and Russia have said that the Aug. 21 attack, in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, was carried out by rebels, not the government.

The site of the attack was visited last month by U.N. investigators who are due to brief Ban on their findings Sunday. Ban told a gathering of women’s groups Friday that the inspectors have obtained “overwhelming” evidence that the attack took place, according to a U.N.-based diplomat.

“I believe that the report will be an overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used, even though I cannot say it publicly at this time,” Ban said in comments he apparently thought were confidential but that were captured on an internal television feed.

Ban did not say who was responsible for using chemical weapons or what nerve agent was used.

But the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unreleased results, said that “the report will clearly say it is sarin” gas and that “it clearly hints that the regime is the perpetrator.”

Ban is scheduled to present the findings to the Security Council on Monday.

Sokolski']",Let’s Be Honest About Israel’s Nukes - The New York Times,"Mr. Obama, like his predecessors, pretends that he doesn’t know anything about them. This taboo impedes discussions within Washington and internationally. It has kept America from pressing Egypt and Syria to ratify the chemical and biological weapons conventions. Doing so would have brought immediate objections about American acceptance of Israel’s nuclear weapons.

What sustains this pretense is the myth that America is locked into covering up Israeli nuclear bombs because of a 1969 agreement between President Richard M. Nixon and Israel’s prime minister, Golda Meir. For Mr. Nixon, it was mainly about gaining Israeli support in the cold war. He and Mrs. Meir understood the need to discourage the Soviets from providing their Arab allies with nuclear weapons. A declared Israeli nuclear arsenal would have led to pressure for Moscow to do so. But such cold war reasons for America to stay mum evaporated decades ago. Everyone knows the Israelis have nuclear bombs. Today, the main effect of the ambiguity is to prevent serious regional arms-control negotiations.

All other countries in the region are members of the nonproliferation treaty, but there are still unresolved issues. Syria was caught building an illicit nuclear reactor in 2007, which Israel swiftly bombed. Mr. Assad still has not allowed international inspectors to fully investigate that obliterated reactor site. And Syria’s ally Iran is suspected of trying to assemble its own weapons program to challenge Israel’s nuclear monopoly. Indeed, many analysts believed that Mr. Obama’s decision to issue a “red line” barring the use of chemical weapons in Syria was in fact driven by the perceived need to demonstrate that he was prepared to use force against Iran if it moved further toward nuclear weapons.

This witches’ brew was supposed to become the subject of an international conference, mandated in 2010 by the unanimous vote of the members of the nonproliferation treaty, including the United States. But that conference hasn’t happened, in part because of White House ambivalence about how it might affect Israel.

In April, the American assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation, Thomas M. Countryman, expressed hope that the conference would be held by this fall. And earlier this month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, urged all parties to set a conference date “as quickly as possible.” He also argued that it should include Israel and Iran. Russia attempted to include the conference in last week’s agreement, but Secretary of State John Kerry resisted. It is not going to go away."

(CNN) —

U.S. officials were pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the initial declaration that Syria has submitted to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog outlining its inventory of the munitions, a senior administration official said Saturday.

The official said the declaration was more complete than what the officials had expected the Syrians to put forth.

The news came hours after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced that Syria had handed over a list of what it says is its chemical arms stockpile.

“The Technical Secretariat is currently reviewing the information received,” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The handover occurred a day before the organization is to meet at The Hague in the Netherlands to discuss Syria.

The timing meets the terms set in a deal forged last week between the United States and Russia in Geneva to begin destroying Syria’s chemical arsenal.

Under the fast-tracked Geneva deal, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was to declare the weapons no later than Saturday.

The normal 60-day process for declaring arms was expedited to seven days “because of the extraordinary concern about Syria’s weapons,” said Michael Luhan, a spokesman for the organization.

“Until now, each country has been typical. The United States, Russia, Libya, India, none have been in a state of war or conflict,” Luhan said Friday.

His organization planned to begin reviewing Monday, he said.

“We have to go through it in detail and plan how to conduct the on-the-ground inspection mission, to verify the accuracy of the declaration and put seals on all the materials to make sure they are secure,” Luhan said.

The stakes over halting the Syrian civil war heightened after an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that U.S. officials estimate killed 1,400 people.

The United States and other Western nations blame the regime for the attack. Russia and Syria say they think rebels used the weapons.

Citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons, U.S. President Barack Obama called for authorization from Congress to use military force in Syria.

As the United States threatened force to degrade Assad’s ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks, a diplomatic opportunity arose between Russia and the United States to put Syria’s stockpile under international control.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hammered out a deal in Geneva last week compelling Syria to accept the agreement. Syria has agreed to it.

Speaking ahead of next week’s U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, Kerry said Thursday that while “the complete removal of Syria’s chemical weapons is possible here, through peaceful means,” urgency is needed.

The U.N. Security Council must be prepared to act next week, Kerry said, citing a U.N. chemical weapons report about the attack.

While the report did not assign responsibility for the attack, Kerry said it offered “crucial details,” making the case implicating Assad “only … more compelling.”

Russia called the report “distorted” and said it was based on insufficient information.

Even as diplomatic efforts were continuing, U.S. officials have not dropped their threat to use force and are wary, saying Syria could be using the diplomacy as a stalling tactic.

“Time is short,” Kerry said. “Let’s not spend time debating what we already know.”

Also on Saturday, the Syrian opposition coalition rejected an offer made by Iran to broker a peace deal between rebels and the government, calling it “ridiculous and desperate.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who is also planning to attend the U.N. General Assembly meeting, said he can help bring peace to Syria, a long-time Iranian ally torn by civil war.

In a Washington Post op-ed on Thursday, the recently elected Iranian president called for an end to “the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart.” And he signaled his desire for better engagement with the West.

Given Iran’s closeness to Syria’s government, it seems unlikely rebels would consider Rouhani an independent broker. But Rouhani’s tone is far less fiery than that of his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And Rouhani’s promise of more positive engagement with the world during his election campaign appeared to propel him to victory.

“The Syrian National Coalition considers Iran’s offer as ridiculous amid all the bloodshed that Iran participated with the (Bashar) al-Assad regime, through political, economic support and military support during the past two and a half years.”

Rouhani, 65, has promised more positive engagement with the world.

But the Syrian opposition coalition said Iran is part of the problem.

“There is no doubt that Rouhani’s offer is a desperate attempt to prolong the crisis and increase the complexity,” the coalition said in a statement.

The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011, a period in which harsh government crackdowns against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.

Another 2 million people have fled their homeland, and more than 4.25 million have been displaced within Syria, the United Nations says.

More violence

Government forces killed at least 26 people Saturday in Hamas suburbs, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees. CNN could not independently verify the claim.

While President Obama has made no secret of his desire to withdraw American troops as rapidly as possible, the plans for a postwar American presence in Afghanistan have generally envisioned a residual force of thousands of troops to carry out counterterrorism operations and to help train and equip Afghan soldiers.

In a conference call with reporters, the deputy national security adviser, Benjamin J. Rhodes, said that leaving no troops “would be an option that we would consider,” adding that “the president does not view these negotiations as having a goal of keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan.”

Military analysts have said it is difficult to conceive of how the United States might achieve even its limited post-2014 goals in Afghanistan without any kind of troop presence. That suggests the White House is staking out a negotiating position with both the Pentagon and with Mr. Karzai, as he and Mr. Obama begin to work out an agreement covering the post-2014 American role in Afghanistan."
http://news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-begin-grapple-syria-215018877--politics.html,,[],Lawmakers begin to grapple with Syria question,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of Congress, abruptly handed exactly the war powers many had demanded, grappled Saturday with whether to sign off on President Barack Obama's plan to punish Syria for an alleged chemical weapons attack. Now with a stake in the nation's global credibility, lawmakers were seeking more information about the possible consequences of striking a region without knowing what would happen next.

The debate over what action, if any, Congress might approve is in its infancy as lawmakers prepare for a public hearing Tuesday by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But the first contours began emerging within hours of Obama's announcement.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he doesn't believe Syria should go unpunished for the Aug. 21 attack near Damascus. ""But we need to understand what the whole scope of consequences is,"" he said by telephone. ""What the president may perceive as limited ... won't stop there.""

Arguing for a strategy that seeks to end Syrian President Bashar Assad's rule, Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina issued a joint statement saying that any operation should be broader in scope than the ""limited"" scope Obama described.

""We cannot in good conscience support isolated military strikes in Syria that are not part of an overall strategy that can change the momentum on the battlefield, achieve the president's stated goal of Assad's removal from power, and bring an end to this conflict, which is a growing threat to our national security interests,"" the senators said.

""Anything short of this would be an inadequate response to the crimes against humanity that Assad and his forces are committing. And it would send the wrong signal to America's friends and allies, the Syrian opposition, the Assad regime, Iran, and the world - all of whom are watching closely what actions America will take,"" they said.

Lawmakers of both parties had, for days, demanded that Obama seek congressional authorization under the War Powers Act. Until Saturday, the president showed no willingness to do so and the military strike appeared imminent. Then, from the White House Rose Garden, Obama said he would strike Syria in a limited way and without boots on the ground. But, he added, he would seek congressional approval first.

Story continues

""All of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote,"" Obama said. ""And in doing so, I ask you, members of Congress, to consider that some things are more important than partisan differences or the politics of the moment.""

With that, Obama dropped the question of Syria, the nation's credibility and the balance of government power in the very laps of lawmakers who had complained about his go-it-alone-style — but were less clear about how they would want to deal with a horrific chemical attack that the administration said killed 1,429 people, including 426 children. Other estimates of the death toll were in the hundreds.

By evening Saturday, the White House sent Congress its draft of a resolution to authorize Obama to use military force. The draft does not lay out a specific timeline or course of military action but gives Obama approval to use the military as he determines ""necessary and appropriate"" to meet its objective of preventing further chemical attacks. It also affirms the administration's view that, ultimately, only a negotiated political settlement can resolve the crisis in Syria.

An aide to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, confirmed that the speaker's office had received the draft.

A hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plus classified and unclassified briefings for senators were being scheduled, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Saturday. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the hearing would take place Tuesday.

Both the Senate and the House planned a vote on the matter no later than the week of Sept. 9.

There's little doubt that Obama as commander in chief could retaliate against Syrian targets without approval from the American people or their representatives in Congress. He did it two years ago in Libya, but in that case, the U.S. led a NATO coalition.

Congress' constitutional power to declare war was refined and expanded by the 1973 War Powers Act, which requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of initiating military action and bars U.S. armed forces for fighting for more than a maximum of 90 days without congressional approval. President Richard Nixon vetoed that bill, but Congress overrode the veto.

Even with that power, Congress hasn't formally declared war since World War II.

Every subsequent conflict involving U.S. forces, including military conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Panama, Iraq, the Caribbean island of Grenada, Kosovo and Libya were undeclared, even though in most cases Congress did vote approval short of a war declaration — sometimes after the fact. The Korean War was fought under the auspices of the United Nations, the one in Kosovo, by NATO.

With Syria, Israel's safety was a key concern. Dealing a blow to Iranian-backed Syria could mean a retaliatory strike against a key ally staunchly backed by many lawmakers, and some said that any president would need the weight of Congress behind him in such a situation.

""The potential for escalation in this situation is so great that I think it's essential that the president not be out there on his own,"" Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said Saturday in an interview.

But that's a different question than whether to carry out such a strike. Like Cornyn, Thornberry said he wanted to know what the goals would be— and the consequences. In town halls held over the recess, he said, constituents asked him why what happened in Syria should matter to them.

""The president has to convince us,"" Thornberry said.

What to do about Syria is a politically perilous question for lawmakers, and one that has scrambled loyalties. Still uncomfortably fresh is the memory of the Iraq war and the Bush administration's justification — since disproven — that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction.

Liberals who voted in October 2002 against giving Republican President George W. Bush the broad authority to invade Iraq over weapons of mass destruction are echoing Obama's push for punitive strikes against Syria.

Some Republicans who in the past embraced Bush's military doctrine of pre-emptive action — and repeatedly rejected Democratic attempts to end decade-plus conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan — have rhetorically grabbed 1960s peace signs in warning against the implications of U.S. intervention in the Mideast conflict.

If Obama intended to make the debate less about his leadership and more about the policy, the move to seek authorization didn't work on Rep. Peter King.

King, a New York Republican and a member of the House's intelligence committee, suggested that the president was undermining the authorities of future presidents and seeking a political shield for himself by going through Congress.

""The president doesn't need 535 members of Congress to enforce his own red line,"" King said.

Washington (CNN) - America's top diplomat dismissed concerns Sunday that the Obama administration was not being skeptical enough while the U.S. negotiates with Iran over its continued enrichment of uranium, activity widely assumed to be supporting a nuclear weapons program.

Secretary of State John Kerry emphatically told David Gregory on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday that ""we are not blind, and I don't think we're stupid"" when it comes to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's past claims that he could game the Western world in brokered talks while his nation continued to pursue its nuclear ambitions.

Kerry's remarks came the morning after three days of intensive talks about Iran's nuclear program concluded early Sunday in Geneva, Switzerland, without an agreement. While the key players, including Kerry, insisted the process continues to move in the right direction, the talks raised fears among U.S. allies that Iran was presenting a disingenous front and has no real intention of slowing its march toward weaponizing its nuclear technology.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is not involved in the talks, warned last week that an agreement would be ""the deal of a century for Iran"" but a ""very dangerous and bad deal for peace.""

With new talks scheduled for November 20, Kerry's Iranian counterpart signaled that progress had been made and the two sides are getting closer and closer to reaching an accord.

""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said.

Kerry trumpeted the historic nature of the talks, calling them ""serious business.”

""This is the first time that the P5 had come together with this kind of a serious set of possible options in front of it with a new Iranian government,"" Kerry said.

The talks involve the P5+1: the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - the countries with permanent seats on the UN Security Council - plus Germany.

Still, in his interview with Gregory, Kerry maintained a healthy dose of skepticism, falling back on the oft-sounded catchall that the administration ""has taken no option off the table.""

""This is a new overture, and it has to be put to the test very, very carefully,"" Kerry said.

""There will not be a relaxation of the pressure,"" he added. ""Nobody has talked about getting rid of the current architecture of sanctions. The pressure will remain."""

http://news.yahoo.com/iran-nuclear-talks-hit-snag-u-sanctions-move-152811100.html,,[],"U.S. sanctions move angers Iran, Russia sees threat to nuclear deal","By Fredrik Dahl and Steve Gutterman VIENNA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A breakthrough agreement to end the standoff over Iran's nuclear program appeared to face its first major difficulty on Friday with Russia warning that expanding a U.S. sanctions blacklist could seriously complicate the deal's implementation. Russia, which, along with the United States, is among the six world powers that negotiated the November 24 interim accord with Tehran, echoed Iranian criticism that it violated the spirit of the deal and could ""block things"". The United States on Thursday blacklisted additional companies and people under existing sanctions intended to prevent Iran from obtaining the capability to make nuclear weapons. Iran denies any such aims. Diplomats said Iran, in what appeared to be a response, interrupted technical talks in Vienna with the six nations over how to implement the agreement, under which Tehran is to curb its atomic activities in return for limited sanctions easing. The developments highlighted potential obstacles negotiators face in pressing ahead with efforts to resolve a decade-old dispute between the Islamic Republic and the West that has stirred fears of a new Middle East war. Western diplomats said the inconclusive outcome of the December 9-12 expert-level discussions should not be seen as a sign that the deal hammered out nearly three weeks ago was in trouble. But Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Iran's semi-official Fars news agency in reaction to the U.S. decision that it was evaluating the situation and would ""react accordingly"", adding, ""It is against the spirit of the Geneva deal."" Russia also made its concerns clear. ""The U.S. administration's decision goes against the spirit of this document,"" said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, referring to the Geneva agreement between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany. ""Widening American 'blacklists' could seriously complicate the fulfillment of the Geneva agreement, which proposes easing sanctions pressure."" In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said she did not think the blacklistings announced on Thursday had made the negotiations more difficult. ""No, I don't. I think it was always going to be very complicated,"" Harf told reporters, adding the United States had told Iranian officials in Vienna that more designations were coming. DEAL OPPONENTS Russia built Iran's first nuclear power plant and has much better ties with Tehran than Western states. It supported four rounds of U.N. Security Council sanctions aimed at reining in Tehran's nuclear program but has criticized the United States and Europe for imposing additional sanctions. U.S. officials said the blacklisting move showed the Geneva deal ""does not, and will not, interfere with our continued efforts to expose and disrupt those supporting Iran's nuclear program or seeking to evade our sanctions"". The new measure, the first such enforcement action since Geneva, targeted entities that are suspected of involvement in the proliferation of materials for weapons of mass destruction and trying to evade the current sanctions. Some U.S. lawmakers want further sanctions on the Islamic state. But the administration of President Barack Obama has campaigned to hold off on new measures for now to create space for the diplomatic push to settle the nuclear dispute. Iran's ambassador to France said expanding the blacklist played into the hands of those opposing the deal - including hardliners in Iran irked by the foreign policy shift and apprehensive that they are losing influence over Iran's most powerful man, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ""This agreement has opponents both inside Iran and outside Iran,"" Ali Ahani told reporters at a meeting of business and political leaders in Monaco. ""We are determined to keep to our commitments, but we have to be sure that on the other side they are serious, and that we can show to our people that we can trust them and that the West is a viable partner."" ""The contents of this accord are quite clear. It was decided not to add sanctions. This type of decision blocks things,"" added Ahani, speaking on behalf of Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who pulled out of the World Policy Conference after his mother was taken ill. 'NOT PANICKING' The Geneva deal was designed to halt Iran's nuclear advances for six months to buy time for negotiations on a final settlement. Scope for diplomacy widened after Iran elected the pragmatic Hassan Rouhani as president in June. He had promised to reduce Tehran's isolation and win sanctions easing. Under the agreement, Iran will restrain its atomic activities in return for some easing of the international sanctions that have battered the major oil producer's economy. But one diplomat said the Iranian delegation in Vienna suddenly announced late on Thursday - hours after Washington made its blacklisting decision public - that it had received instructions to return to Tehran: ""It was quite unexpected."" An EU diplomat said he did not believe the decision was linked to the issues under discussion in Vienna, but rather ""their reaction to moves in the U.S. on sanctions"". The hope was that it was a temporary problem: ""The Iranians have been committed to making this work. We are not panicking."" Iranian officials were not available for comment. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he expected the implementation talks to resume in the coming days. ""We have been hard at it in Vienna ... we are making progress but I think that they're at a point in those talks where folks feel a need to consult and take a moment,"" he said during a visit to Israel. ""There is every expectation that the talks are going to continue in the next few days and that we will proceed to the full implementation of that plan."" A spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who coordinates the discussions with Iran, also said they were expected to resume soon. ""After four days of lengthy and detailed talks, reflecting the complexity of the technical issues discussed, it became clear that further work is needed,"" Michael Mann said.

President Barack Obama's gestures at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in Johannesburg were widely scrutinized on the world's stage Tuesday.

First, Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro as the U.S. president approached the podium at the soccer stadium to address Mandela's mourners. The brief exchange, captured on video and photographs, sparked an immediate reaction online and on TV, with cable news pundits and Twitter users debating the significance of warmth shown between leaders of countries that have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1959.

The handshake also drew some sharp GOP criticism. Sen. John McCain likened it to shaking hands with Adolf Hitler.

""Why should you shake hands with somebody who's keeping Americans in prison?"" McCain told Public Radio International, adding: ""Neville Chamberlain shook hands with Hitler.""

""This wasn't a preplanned encounter,"" an Obama aide told Yahoo News on Tuesday. ""Above all else, today is about honoring Nelson Mandela, and that was the president's singular focus.""

At another point, President Obama posed for a ""selfie"" from his seat at the memorial with British Prime Minister David Cameron and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. First lady Michelle Obama, seated to the group's left, did not participate.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/24093997,,[],"Russia deal an 'important step', says Obama","US President Barack Obama has welcomed an agreement between the US and Russia which says Syria's chemical weapons must be destroyed or removed.

He said that America has a duty to keep the world free of the fear of chemical weapons.

America and Russia agreed a deal to remove or destroy all of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014, otherwise military action could still take place.

China, France, Britain and the UN all say they're satisfied by the agreement.

A statement from the US warned that they expected Syria ""to live up to its public commitments"".

An outline of the US-Russian document says that Syria must provide details of its weapons within a week.

This happened after three days of intensive talks about how to respond to the suspected chemical weapons attacks that killed hundreds of people in Syria last month.

The US had been considering firing missiles at Syrian weapons factories but Russia favoured a handover of illegal gas and firearms instead.

The main points

America's Secretary of State John Kerry agreed a plan with Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, that they'll now handover to the United Nations.

It has several main points:

The Syrian government must hand over a full list of the weapons it has within a week.

Syria must give UN weapons inspectors immediate access to all their factories.

All chemical weapons must be destroyed or removed from the country by mid-2014.

If Syria's government fails to do any of the above then the UN could impose punishments on them, including the possibility of military action.

Britain's Foreign Minister William Hague has welcomed the deal and France, which was the only country willing to join the US in taking military action against Syria, has also backed it.

Different ideas

America and Russia have had very different ideas about how to respond to the suspected poisonous gas attacks that killed hundreds of Syrians in Damascus last month. American thinks Syria's president Bashar al-Assad was responsible but he's denied it.

But after the Syrian president announced on he was willing to hand over the weapons on Thursday talks between Russia and America were stepped up to try and achieve a peaceful outcome.

USA TODAY

Federal authorities filed the extradition request for Snowden on June 14

Snowden is charged with leaking classified information under the Espionage Act

A one-page criminal complaint against Snowden was unsealed Friday

The U.S. government has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Edward Snowden, the former government contractor accused of espionage for leaking classified information about two secret surveillance programs run by the National Security Agency.

A Justice Department official, who is not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that the U.S. will seek to bring Snowden to the U.S., where he faces charges of theft and espionage. A criminal complaint was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia on June 14 and was unsealed Friday.

A senior administration official also not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY that the United States is asking Hong Kong to act quickly on the request or risk complicating relations between the two for failing to hand Snowden over as required by international law.

Snowden, who turned 30 on Friday, has been the focus of a criminal investigation since he acknowledged earlier this month that he was the source of materials detailing surveillance programs that collected telephone records for millions of Americans and a separate operation that targeted the Internet communications of non-citizens abroad who were suspected of terrorist connections.

Snowden, who was employed by Booz Allen Hamilton as an NSA systems analyst in Hawaii, fled to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong last month with top-secret documents and court orders on government surveillance operations.

A formal extradition request to bring Snowden to the United States from Hong Kong could drag through appeal courts for years and would pit Beijing against Washington at a time China is trying to deflect U.S. accusations that it carries out extensive surveillance on American government and commercial operations.

A one-page criminal complaint against Snowden was unsealed Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., part of the Eastern District of Virginia where his former employer, government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, is headquartered, in McLean. He is charged with unauthorized communication of national defense information, willful communication of classified communications intelligence information and theft of government property. The first two are under the Espionage Act and each of the three crimes carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on conviction.

The complaint is dated June 14, five days after Snowden's name first surfaced as the person who had leaked to the news media that the NSA, in two highly classified surveillance programs, gathered telephone and Internet records to ferret out terror plots.

Snowden told the South China Morning Post in an interview published Saturday on its website that he hoped to stay in the autonomous region of China because he has faith in ""the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate.""

A prominent former politician in Hong Kong, Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, said he doubted whether Beijing would intervene yet.

""Beijing would only intervene according to my understanding at the last stage. If the magistrate said there is enough to extradite, then Mr. Snowden can then appeal,"" he said.

Lee said Beijing could then decide at the end of the appeal process if it wanted Snowden extradited or not.

If formal extradition is pursued, Snowden could contest it on grounds of political persecution.

Hong Kong lawyer Mark Sutherland said that the filing of a refugee, torture or inhuman punishment claim acts as an automatic bar on any extradition proceedings until those claims can be assessed.

""Some asylum seekers came to Hong Kong 10 years ago and still haven't had their protection claims assessed,"" Sutherland said.

Hong Kong lawmakers said that the Chinese government should make the final decision on whether Snowden should be extradited to the United States.

USA TODAY

Note: An earlier version of this post had a mistaken headline.

Things aren't exactly warming up between the Obama administration and Vladimir Putin, even as President Obama arrived in St. Petersburg for the G-20 summit.

Putin called Obama Secretary of State John Kerry a liar over Kerry's testimony this week before Congress.

The question may be al-Qaeda's influence on the Syrian rebels, an issue Kerry has downplayed.

Speaking to his human rights council Wednesday, Putin said, ""This was very unpleasant and surprising for me. We talk to them (the Americans), and we assume they are decent people, but he is lying and he knows that he is lying. This is sad.""

Putin has criticized Obama administration claims that Bashar Assad's government attacked the rebels with chemical weapons.

Last month, Obama canceled a summit meeting with Putin after a series of U.S.-Russian disputes, including Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.

As for the new flap over Kerry's testimony, the Associated Press reported:

""It was unclear exactly what Putin was referencing, but Kerry was asked Tuesday while testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee if the Syrian opposition had become more infiltrated by al-Qaeda.

""Kerry responded that that was 'basically incorrect' and that the opposition has 'increasingly become more defined by its moderation.' ...

""In testimony Wednesday, Kerry said he didn't agree that 'a majority (of the opposition) are al-Qaeda and the bad guys.' Extremists amount to 15 to 25% of the opposition, he said, including al-Nusra and many other groups that are 'fighting each other, even now.'""

Asked about Putin's comments, National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes said, ""Well, we certainly would side with Secretary Kerry in that back-and-forth.""

State Dept. spokeswoman Jen Psaki called Putin's comment ""preposterous"" and said Kerry is a decorated combat veteran who has had more than words aimed at him, according to the Associated Press."

State Department issued warnings because of possible attacks

Agency has warned against traveling to many parts of the Middle East

Situation in Lebanon portrayed as especially dangerous

The U.S. Department of State has issued warnings against traveling to Lebanon and Turkey because of the possibility of attacks against U.S. citizens.

The Friday warnings come after a State Department order for a drawdown of non-emergency government personnel and their families in Beirut, Lebanon, and Adana, Turkey.

So far this summer, the State Department has issued several warnings for travel throughout the Middle East, including to Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.

The warning for Lebanon says ""all travel"" should be avoided because the potential for a ""spontaneous upsurge in violence remains."" The warning for Turkey says U.S. citizens should avoid the southeastern part of the country. It does not specifically mention Istanbul, a popular destination in northwest Turkey.

John Rendeiro, vice president of global security and intelligence for International SOS, which provides assistance to travelers abroad, says the State Department seems to be making preparations for possible U.S.-led military intervention in Syria.

""This is sort of preparing in the event that there is a military strike and some kind of action in Syria that will lead to retaliation by Syria and its allies,"" he says. ""If they are taking measures warning their own employees about the threat, they have to notify the public about that.""

The State Department portrayed the situation in Lebanon, which shares a border with Syria, as especially dangerous for U.S. citizens.

Lebanese government authorities, the State Department warning says, can't guarantee the protection of visitors if violence should break out.

""Access to borders, airports, roads and seaports can be interrupted with little or no warning,"" the warning says. ""Public demonstrations occur frequently with little warning and have the potential to become violent. Family, neighborhood or sectarian disputes often escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with little or no warning. The ability of U.S. government personnel to reach travelers or provide emergency services may be severely limited.""

The State Department says that a number of extremist groups operate in Lebanon, including Hezbollah, which the U.S. government has designated a terrorist organization.

Hezbollah and other paramilitary groups have been known to detain foreigners for ""political motivations as well as for interrogation – sometimes for hours or longer,"" the warning says. Kidnapping is also a problem.

Travelers should particularly stay away from the border regions between Lebanon and Syria because the conflict in Syria has led to incidents there that have resulted in deaths in some cases, the warning says.

Lebanon's conflicts with Israel can also pose a problem for travelers.

""Rocket attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel have occurred in the past and remain a potential threat,"" the warning says. ""These attacks frequently provoke a military response from Israel. The rocket attacks and responses occur with no warning.""

As for Turkey, the State Department says that there have been no direct attacks on U.S. citizens but that travelers should still avoid demonstrations and large gatherings because they can escalate into violence.

The State Department says anyone who has to travel to the two countries should enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive updates and make it easier for the U.S. Embassy to stay in touch.

U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon, in particular, should ""keep a low profile, assess their personal security and vary times and routes for all required travel,"" the warning says."

Guardian%3A Obama asked for potential cybertargets

Cyberdefense a priority%2C U.S. government official says

Pentagon revising rules for cyberweapons

WASHINGTON – In a secret directive issued last year, President Obama ordered the government to draw up potential overseas cybertargets in the event the United States would be required to launch its own cyberattacks, according to a published report.

The Guardian newspaper in London published the directive, which was issued by the president last October. USA TODAY could not independently confirm the authenticity of the directive.

Last October, the White House released talking points about the directive, mostly pertaining to improving cooperation between industry and government to defend against cyberattacks.

Friday, a National Security Council spokeswoman did not confirm the contents of the memo, which The Guardian published on its website but said the directive was part of Obama's effort to make cyberdefense a priority.

""This directive establishes principles and processes for the use of cyberoperations so that cyber-tools are integrated with the full array of national security tools we have at our disposal,"" Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman, said in a statement.

The U.S. government has said it has developed offensive and defensive capabilities, and the order appears to be an effort to establish ground rules for their use.

It comes as the Pentagon is revising its own ""rules of engagement"" for using cyber-weapons.

The directive says the United States would seek approval from other countries if the cyber-operation would impact networks within their borders. The order as published by The Guardian says that by drawing up potential targets in advance, the United States will be better positioned to strike quickly if called upon to do so."

Obama said Tuesday he needs more evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria

%22Obama will never be obliged to do anything%2C%22 Syrian rebel supporter says

Obama said in August that a %22red line%22 for the U.S. would be chemical weapons use

BERLIN — Supporters of rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad expressed disappointment Tuesday at President Obama's insistence that the United States needs more facts about Assad's use of chemical weapons before ordering American response.

""Obama will never get the concrete evidence he wants unless there's a full U.N. investigation, to which Assad will not agree,"" said Abdulwahab Omar, a Syrian anti-Assad activist based in London.

""That means Obama will never be obliged to do anything,"" he said. ""You can call it a bluff. He tried to show that the United States would be prepared to intervene when things get serious, when in reality, the U.S. is not prepared to intervene unless its own interests are directly affected.""

At a news conference Tuesday at the White House, Obama said the United States has evidence chemical weapons were used in Syria but does not know who used them. Until that is clear, the U.S. would not make any decisions on how to respond, he said.

When reports surfaced last year that the Syrian army had deployed chemical weapons, Obama was pressed on whether the use of such weapons would prompt him to order some form of U.S. military intervention to stop it. Syrian rebels have been asking Western nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Syria as they did in Libya to prevent the slaughter of opposition forces there in 2011.

Obama said in August that a ""red line"" for the United States would be if ""we see a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around, or being utilized. That would change my calculus.""

The Syrian regime denies using weapons and says the rebels have used them.

Reports surfaced again last month that Syria has used chemical weapons against the rebels. Last week, the chief of intelligence for the Israeli Defense Forces said Israel had determined that Assad had used a form of nerve gas on civilians in rebel strongholds.

In response to questions from Congress, the White House said last week that it believed ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that the Syrian government used a small quantity of sarin gas in its battles with rebels.

On Tuesday, reporters asked Obama whether he would respond militarily if he were satisfied that Syria crossed his ""red line.""

""We would have to rethink the range of options before us,"" he said, and added that the use of chemical weapons is worrying because they could fall into the hands of anti-American factions.

Abdulwahab Omar believes that is the only red line Obama is concerned about.

""What he really meant is if chemical weapons are used in such a way that they might be considered a threat to U.S. interests,"" he said. ""The chemical attacks that have (been carried out) by the Assad regime are small-scale and only against Syrians — they did not have international consequences. As a result, Obama will not do anything.""

The Obama administration has said it supports an investigation by the United Nations to determine how the chemical weapons were used. But the U.N. has already initiated an investigation that stalled when Assad refused permission for investigators to enter the country.

""Proof can only be achieved through full, impartial investigations,"" Omar said. ""This is something that you cannot do in the war zone. The Assad regime will not allow it to happen.""

Omar says Obama is saving face and that if the United States had any real interest in aiding the fall of the Assad regime, it would have done so by now.

The U.N. says about 80,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict that began in March 2011.

""We are two years into this conflict. Pretty much every atrocity the regime can do, it has done. Mass killings, executions, the use of scud missiles, chemical weapons,"" he said. ""There's not much left for the regime to do that would bring the Obama administration's conscience out."""

The white-bearded chairman of the council, known as a loya jirga, told Karzai he miscalculated when the Afghan president demanded a delay in signing the agreement until next spring. Chairman Sibghatullah Mojaddedi lectured Karzai, warning that if he delays signing the agreement, “I’ll resign and leave the country.

“If he had listened to my advice, we wouldn’t have this problem today,” Mojaddedi, 89, a former Afghan president and longtime confidant and mentor to Karzai, said as the president sat stiffly a few paces away.

But Karzai remained adamant that he will not sign the accord until after the Afghan presidential election in April. That stubborn stance has infuriated U.S. officials, who Friday imposed a Dec. 31 deadline.

Karzai asked the council for more time to negotiate with the United States. “We’ll try to bargain more with the Americans on your behalf” and then sign the agreement much later, he said.

He asked for a chance to apply more political pressure so Afghanistan doesn’t capitulate on the agreement “for free,” that is, without forcing American concessions.

“If there is no peace, this agreement will bring misfortune to Afghanistan,” Karzai added in a somewhat elliptical reference to the potential impact of the accord.

Karzai did not indicate whether he ultimately will brush aside the loya jirga recommendation and defy the U.S. deadline. The Afghan president is notorious for delaying tactics that seek to extract concessions and keep himself at the center of events, especially as he enters a lame-duck period before his term ends in April.

The loya jirga’s bold defiance of Karzai presents an opportunity for the mercurial president to save face and back down on the brinkmanship that has put the security deal in serious jeopardy. Mojaddedi told Karzai bluntly: “If there is a problem in the future” with the agreement, “the jirga is responsible.”

Karzai convened the loya jirga, an informal but influential traditional assembly, to give himself political cover and deflect responsibility for signing a long-term commitment with the United States, according to many Afghan analysts. Karzai faces significant opposition from Afghan traditionalists who condemn any cooperation with foreigners, especially the United States.

Karzai remained defiant Sunday, telling the jirga’s 2,700 delegates that American soldiers continue to raid Afghan homes and kill civilians. He dug in his heels over that issue last week, just hours after agreeing with U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry on the text of the draft 24-page security pact.

President Obama responded with a personal letter to Karzai on Thursday that pledged U.S. troops would enter Afghan homes only in “extraordinary” circumstances and only if American lives were at direct risk.

Mojaddedi confronted Karzai after the president joined him on the stage, firmly reminding him that the U.S. had given written assurances on so-called U.S. night raids. The loya jirga voted to attach Obama’s letter to the text of the proposed Bilateral Security Agreement.

“I repeat: The United States cannot enter Afghan homes and kill people,” Karzai told the chairman, who turned to face him on the assembly stage. Mojaddedi, gesticulating forcefully, again told the man he called his “son and student” to accept U.S. assurances and sign now, not later.

Karzai muttered, “All right,” and abruptly left the stage.

In voting to approve the agreement, the loya jirga said in its formal declaration that Karzai should sign by the end of the year. The council recommended several additions to the pact, among them the release of 19 Afghans from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay and a stronger U.S. pledge to defend Afghanistan from any incursion from its neighbors, particularly Pakistan.

The loya jirga also voted to request that the U.S. military add a base to the nine bases that would be occupied by U.S. troops under the proposed security pact after combat forces depart Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

The base is in Bamian province in central Afghanistan, where the NATO-led military coalition has maintained a presence. Bamian is a population center for Hazaras, a Shiite Muslim minority whose members were massacred by the Taliban prior to the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the militant group. Afghan analysts said Hazara delegates proposed the additional base.

The agreement must still be approved by Afghanistan’s elected parliament. Karzai will decide when to present it to the legislature, which is expected to endorse it.

Approval by the loya jirga capped a fraught six-day showdown between Karzai and the United States that began with a phone call negotiation between Karzai and Kerry on Tuesday. It peaked with Washington threatening to leave no troops after 2014 — meaning a drastic cut in billions of dollars in military and development aid sent to Afghanistan.

That threat panicked many ordinary Afghans, as well as wealthy Afghan businessmen. Those concerns were reflected in the loya jirga membership. Most of the 50 loya jirga committee chairpersons who spoke Sunday urged Karzai to sign the pact quickly to avoid a collapse in security at a time when the Taliban insurgency remains potent.

If approved, the agreement would allow the U.S. to deploy military advisors to train and equip Afghan security forces, along with U.S. special-operations troops for counter-terrorism missions against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Obama will determine the size of the force.

Karzai “overreached” and miscalculated the true sentiments of the loya jirga and the Afghan people, Waliullah Rahmani, director of the Kabul Center for Strategic Studies, said in an interview. He said most Afghans recognize that the country cannot survive without U.S. military and cash assistance, along with the international commitment the post-2014 U.S. presence would bring.

“I don’t think President Karzai expected this,” Rahmani said. “He won’t be able to resist the national will of the Afghan people, as expressed today through the loya jirga.”

In some of the most aggressive language used yet by the administration, Mr. Kerry accused the Syrian government of the “indiscriminate slaughter of civilians” and of cynical efforts to cover up its responsibility for a “cowardly crime.”

Mr. Kerry’s remarks at the State Department reinforced the administration’s toughening stance on the Syria conflict, which is now well into its third year, and indicated that the White House was moving closer to a military response in consultation with America’s allies.

Administration officials said that although President Obama had not made a final decision on military action, he was likely to order a limited military operation — cruise missiles launched from American destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea at military targets in Syria, for example — and not a sustained air campaign intended to topple Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, or to fundamentally alter the nature of the conflict on the ground."

(CNN) —

It has long been said that in war, “truth is the first casualty.”

It is generally accepted, however, that the United States, the world’s leading democracy, should try to make truth-telling a common practice when it goes to war.

When Gen. David Petraeus was U.S. commander in Afghanistan in 2010 he issued guidance to his troops, one of the key points of which was to “be first with the truth.” The guidance explained, “Avoid spinning, and don’t try to ‘dress up’ an ugly situation. Acknowledge setbacks and failures, including civilian casualties, and then state how we’ll respond and what we’ve learned.”

Tim Hetherington for CNN Peter Bergen

Yet, in Yemen where the U.S. has been fighting a small, undeclared war for the past four years, we have now arrived at the ironic point where America’s main enemy there, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is doing a better job of truth telling than the U.S.

In a video message released on Sunday, a leader of al Qaeda in Yemen apologized for an attack on a hospital in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa earlier this month in which civilians were killed.

According to the al Qaeda leader, the attackers were targeting the Yemeni Ministry of Defense, but one fighter made a mistake and attacked a hospital inside the defense ministry: “We confess to this mistake and fault. We offer our apologies and condolences to the families of the victims,” said the al Qaeda leader.

While al Qaeda has publicly – and, no doubt, self-servingly – apologized for killing civilians at the Yemeni hospital during the attack in Sanaa on December 5, at the same time American officials have said nothing publicly about a U.S. drone strike that took place a week later on a suspected convoy of militants in western Yemen on December 12.

The target of this strike turned out to be a wedding party and at least a half dozen civilians are reliably reported to have died.

This gets to a key problem of the secretive American drone program. Its clandestine and unaccountable nature means that when the U.S. does make a mistake, as it inevitably will, instead of apologizing and making some kind of compensation to the civilian victims of a botched strike – a common practice when the U.S. military inadvertently kills civilians in wartime – American officials instead say … nothing.

Or worse, they make claims that the program is somehow perfect and never kills civilians as Obama’s then top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, improbably claimed of the drone program in June 2011 when he said that for almost a year, “there hasn’t been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities we’ve been able to develop.” Brennan is now the CIA director.

Seeking to redress some of the problems in the drone program, on May 23 President Barack Obama gave a major speech about his counterterrorism policies in Washington in which he said, “Before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured – the highest standard we can set.”

Did Obama’s speech and the new policy it sought to inaugurate make any difference to the drone program? Short answer: Yes.

Since that speech the Obama administration has dramatically cut the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and has slightly slowed the number of strikes in Yemen.

There were 14 drone strikes in Pakistan during the past seven months; an average of one strike every 15 days. In the year before Obama’s speech, drone strikes happened every eight days. And there have been no reliably reported civilian casualties in Pakistan from drone strikes since Obama’s May speech, according to an analysis of the drone program by the New America Foundation.

The pace of drone strikes fell in Yemen after Obama’s speech, too, but not as much as it did in Pakistan. Since May 23, there have been 16, an average of about one strike every 13 days. During the previous year, a strike occurred about once every 10 days.

It’s worth noting that the civilian death rate has fallen steadily overall in both Pakistan and Yemen over the past several years, but the strike on December 12 in Yemen and the civilian casualties it caused is a reminder that there is definitely room for improvement.

What can be done?

One idea to make the drone program as accountable as possible is to set up an internal U.S. government body that is independent of the CIA and Pentagon that would conduct reviews of the drone strikes after they have occurred.

One could imagine, for instance, that a small, nonpartisan group of experts on security and law, similar to the group that Obama appointed to analyze the activities of the NSA, could review the aftermath of drone strikes to examine whether the victims of the strikes were in fact militants who posed some kind of threat to the United States. Such additional oversight would make CIA targeters and drone operators all the more diligent to avoid mistakes.

By Mick Krever, CNN

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday delivered his first English-language TV message to the American people in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

""I would like to say to American people: I bring peace and friendship from Iranians to Americans,"" he said.

Rouhani is in many ways the ""it"" man of this U.N. General Assembly, where Western leaders are trying to gauge whether his diplomatic overtures will translate into concrete policy changes.

He has recently exchanged letters with U.S. President Barack Obama, and there had been suspicion brewing in diplomatic circles that the two leaders would meet face-to-face, informally, at the United Nations in New York.

""There were some talks about it,"" Rouhani told Amanpour through a translator. ""And preparation for the work was done a bit as well.""

""The United States declared its interest in having such a meeting, and in principle Iran could have under certain circumstances allowed for it to happen,"" he said. ""But I believe we didn't have sufficient time to really coordinate the meeting to the full extent that we needed to.""

Two senior U.S. administration officials told CNN on Tuesday that the encounter was called off because it was considered ""too complicated"" for Iran back home.

Complicated domestic politics or not, the Iranian president made clear that he has full permission from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to negotiate with the West.

""I think that the president of Iran has the authority whenever the national interest of the country is involved,"" Rouhani told Amanpour. ""The supreme leader of Iran has said that should negotiations be necessary for the national interest of the country, he is in fact not opposed to it.""

""Now, if an opportunity was created today, had arisen today,"" the Iranian president said, ""and the prep work for that had been done, most probably the talks would have haven taken place, primarily focused on the nuclear issue or the developments on the Middle East. Therefore the supreme leader, I can tell you, has given permission for my government to freely negotiate on these issues.""

Rouhani stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who used his speeches at the U.N. to spew rhetoric; he was famous for his questioning of the Holocaust.

""I have said before that I am not a historian, and that when it comes to speaking of the dimensions of the Holocaust it is the historians that should reflect on it,"" Rouhani told Amanpour. ""But in general I can tell you that any crime that happens in history against humanity, including the crime the Nazis committed towards the Jews, as well as non-Jewish people, was reprehensible and condemnable as far as we are concerned."""

The videos are the first taken of Snowden since he was granted asylum in Russia.

""If we can't understand the policies and programs of our government, we can't grant our consent in regulating them,"" Snowden said in one of the videos posted Friday night.

Watch a video of Snowden receiving the award above, and see more videos from the event here.

Below, more from the AP on Snowden's award:

MOSCOW (AP) — The former National Security Agency systems analyst, Edward Snowden, said that the mass surveillance programs used by the United States to tap into phone and internet connections around the world are making people less safe.

In short video clips posted by the WikiLeaks website on Friday, Snowden said that the NSA's mass surveillance, which he disclosed before fleeing to Russia, ""puts us at risk of coming into conflict with our own government.""

A U.S. court has charged Snowden with violating the Espionage Act for disclosing those programs.

Snowden described them as a ""dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under sort of an eye that sees everything even when it's not needed.""

""They hurt our economy. They hurt our country. They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely,"" Snowden said.

The videos are the first of Snowden speaking since July 12, when the former NSA analyst was shown at a Moscow airport pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on Aug. 1. That decision has strained the relations between the U.S. and Russia, and President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Putin at a summit hosted by Russia in September.

Snowden said the U.S. government was ""unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they'll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth.""

In a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the U.S. military of deliberately underestimating the enemy's strength for political purposes, and given annually by a group of retired U.S. national security officers. Four former U.S. government officials who were at the ceremony told The Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.

American worker Warren Weinstein was kidnapped in Pakistan by al-Qaeda more than two years ago

Weinstein appealed to President Obama in a video released Thursday to negotiate his release

The video of Warren Weinstein was the first since two videos released in September 2012

ISLAMABAD (AP) — A 72-year-old American development worker who was kidnapped in Pakistan by al-Qaeda more than two years ago appealed to President Obama in a video released Thursday to negotiate his release, saying he feels ""totally abandoned and forgotten.""

The video of Warren Weinstein was the first since two videos released in September 2012. Weinstein, the country director in Pakistan for J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S.-based firm that advises a range of Pakistani business and government sectors, was abducted from his house in the eastern city of Lahore in August 2011.

In the video sent Thursday to reporters in Pakistan including The Associated Press, Weinstein called on the U.S. government to negotiate his release.

""Nine years ago I came to Pakistan to help my government, and I did so at a time when most Americans would not come here, and now when I need my government it seems that I have been totally abandoned and forgotten,"" Weinstein said during the 13-minute video. ""And so I again appeal to you to instruct your appropriate officials to negotiate my release.""

The video and an accompanying letter purported to be from Weinstein was emailed anonymously to reporters in Pakistan. The video was labelled ""As-Sahab,"" which is al-Qaeda's media wing, but its authenticity could not be independently verified. The letter was dated Oct. 3, 2013 and in the video Weinstein said he had been in captivity for two years.

In the video, Weinstein wore a grey track suit jacket and what appeared to be a black knit hat on his head. His face was partially covered with a beard.

Al-Qaeda has said Weinstein would be released if the U.S. halted airstrikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen and also demanded the release of all al-Qaeda and Taliban suspects around the world.

The White House has called for Weinstein's immediate release but has said it won't negotiate with al-Qaeda.

The videos last year showed Weinstein appealing for help from the Jewish community and Israel's prime minister."

(CNN) —

The United States and its allies aren’t “blind” or “stupid” when it comes to negotiations with Iran, Washington’s top diplomat said Sunday after nuclear talks with the Islamic republic broke up without an agreement.

“We are absolutely determined that this would be a good deal, or there’ll be no deal,” Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

“This is a new overture, and it has to be put to the test very, very carefully,” he added.

But Israel’s prime minister cheered the failure of the talks, saying the agreement reportedly on the table would have been a “jackpot” for Iran. Iran’s president, meanwhile, tried to reassure his parliament that he won’t trade away Tehran’s ability to produce nuclear fuel in any agreement to lift international sanctions.

After two days of foreign minister-level talks, negotiations between Iran and the five U.N. Security Council members plus Germany ended in Geneva, Switzerland, early Sunday. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, told reporters, “A lot of concrete progress has been achieved, but some differences remain.”

Negotiations are set to resume November 20, with Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif attending.

“I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that’s important,” Zarif said. “And that gives us the impetus to go forward.”

Iran insists its aims are peaceful

Iran has refused U.N. Security Council demands to halt its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to power nuclear reactors or in extremely high concentrations, to make an atomic bomb.

It insists it wants to build civilian power plants, but Western powers and Israel accuse it of harboring ambitions for a nuclear weapon. U.N. inspectors reported in 2011 that they could no longer verify the Iranian program was strictly peaceful.

Iran’s refusal to stop enriching uranium has led to sanctions that have crippled its economy, slashing its crude oil exports and triggering widespread inflation at home. But President Hassan Rouhani, whose overtures to the West since taking office in August raised hopes of a deal, said Sunday that Tehran has its own “red lines” that his government won’t cross.

“The rights of the Iranian nation and national interests are our red lines, and those rights include nuclear rights within the framework of international law, as well as enrichment on Iranian soil,” Rouhani told lawmakers, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.

But nonproliferation expert Joseph Cirincione told CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” that the outlines of a deal appear clear, and he expected one would be clinched “very soon.”

“We’ve seen some remarkable developments over the last couple days, including the normalization of U.S and Iranian dialogue,” Cirincione said. “We now take it for granted that the secretary of state should talk to Iran’s foreign minister, but that hadn’t happened in 34 years until last September.”

What’s on the table in talks

Two senior U.S. administration officials said that in the proposal on the table, Iran would agree to stop enriching uranium to a concentration of 20% – well above the level needed to fuel a nuclear power plant, though still far below what’s needed to produce a nuclear weapon. Tehran would render most of its existing stockpile of 20% enriched uranium unusable under the proposal.

In addition, it would agree not to use its advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can operate five times faster than older models used in its enrichment plants. And it wouldn’t activate a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which can be used to produce plutonium. That’s a demand that France in particular insisted upon, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said.

Iran’s nuclear capabilities

The officials said that in return, the P5+1 powers of the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany would unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas and consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals. Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said.

One of the officials said the deal was designed to delay the point at which Iran could develop a nuclear weapon while providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief. But Fabius told radio station France Inter on Saturday that while Paris wanted a deal, it wouldn’t agree to a “fool’s game” – and that the proposal on the table at that time was unsatisfactory.

“Thank God for France,” U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a leading Republican who is pushing for another round of sanctions on Iran, told CNN’s “State of the Union.” The Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, told ABC’s “This Week” that the United States “can’t want the deal more than Iranians.”

Graham: New sanctions on Iran needed

And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had criticized the negotiations last week, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Iran should have to dismantle its existing centrifuges and the Arak reactor as part of any agreement.

“Iran gives practically nothing, and it gets a hell of a lot. That’s not a good deal,” Netanyahu said. He said other Arab states shared his opinion.

“And you know, when you have the Arabs and Israelis speaking in one voice – it doesn’t happen very often – I think it’s worth paying attention to.”

Kerry: We know what we’re doing

Kerry told NBC that critics are underestimating the negotiators.

“Some of the most serious and capable, expert people in our government, who have spent a lifetime dealing both with Iran as well as with nuclear weapon and nuclear armament and proliferation, are engaged in our negotiation. We are not blind, and I don’t think we’re stupid,” Kerry said.

“I think we have a pretty strong sense of how to measure whether or not we are acting in the interests of our country and of the globe, and particularly of our allies like Israel and Gulf states and others in the region.”

The State Department dispatched a top Kerry deputy, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, to Jerusalem to discuss the Geneva talks with Israeli officials, a senior State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity.

For years, international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear-armed Iran could bring to the Middle East. Those fears, for example, include the possibility of a pre-emptive Israeli strike that could spark a broader conflict. In the past, Iran has threatened Israel with military attack.

They also include concerns that an Iranian bomb could spur other countries in the region to seek nuclear weapons of their own, leading to a spiraling arms race in the region.

Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, though it has never declared itself to be a nuclear power.

Pollak'],Clarence Page Points to Obama's Hypocrisy on Syria,"Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page is one of President Barack Obama’s more reliable defenders–or, more accurately, a reliable critic of Obama’s critics. Yet Page asks a key question in his column Sunday: “Would a younger Obama vote for his new military action?” The answer, Page suggests throughout, is “no”–and highlights the hypocrisy in Obama’s stance.

Noting broad public and congressional opposition to a Syria strike, Page recounts how Obama built his political reputation and his presidential campaign on his vehement opposition to the Iraq War, which was then being justified to the public by President George W. Bush in terms similar to those that Obama is using to justify military action in Syria today:

In a speech at a Chicago anti-war rally in October 2002 that would prove pivotal to his 2008 presidential rise, Obama, than an Illinois state senator, famously made a case against President George W. Bush’s Iraq War that ironically describes why so many people oppose Obama’s proposed Syria attack. He did not oppose all wars, Obama forcefully pointed out, but he opposed “a dumb war. A rash war.” No question that Saddam Hussein was “a brutal man,” said Obama back then, “… who butchers his own people to secure his own power.” But Obama also pointed out that Saddam “… poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States.”… The circumstances in Syria are different. Iraq, for example, did not have the weapons of mass destruction that our bogus intelligence reports said they had. By contrast, on Aug. 21 a poison-gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus, Syria’s capital, killed more than 1,400 civilians. But the “clear rationale,” clear goals and “strong international support” that separates smart policy from “dumb” wars is lacking….

Page goes on to note that Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel made a poor case in the Senate and House last week, particularly in their fumbling attempts to reassure elected officials that the limited strike that Obama seeks on Syria will not lead to “mission creep” that takes the U.S., unprepared, to a boots-on-the-ground war.

“Team Obama did not want to speculate about that. But those are the kind of questions I think Sen. Obama would have asked,” he concludes."

Special for USA TODAY

The State Department has warned U.S. citizens to defer travel or leave the country

Egyptian anger against the U.S. government has increased in recent weeks

Some Americans who have deep roots in Egypt aren%27t so quick to leave

CAIRO — When American Drew Brammer accidentally stayed out after the 7 p.m. curfew here Saturday, he became a little worried.

""I'm afraid if I walk out they'll be like, 'Where's your passport? We need to go to your house,' "" the English teacher from Oregon said via phone from a Cairo gym — where he got caught up in a political chat — not far from a security checkpoint.

Some Americans have fled the country amid the ongoing unrest this summer in Egypt, where nearly 900 were killed this week alone in clashes between security forces and protesters. Others have changed their plans to arrive, but some, like Brammer, are choosing to stay in a nation where residents are living under a constant state of emergency.

""Part of me kind of thinks that this will pass and I can just ride it out,"" said Brammer, 28, who teaches English in Egypt and also studies Arabic.

On Thursday, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to defer travel or leave the country because of ongoing political and social unrest. The agency urged Americans to follow local regulations, including the 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. government-imposed curfew.

Fresh turmoil began at the end of June when millions took to the streets to protest against then-president Mohammed Morsi. After the leader was ousted in early July, the State Department ordered all non-emergency embassy staff and their families to depart. A travel warning was also issued.

Some have heeded the caution. A group of American interns on scholarship here were told to leave, said Jessica Smelser, who recently graduated from George Washington University with a master's degree.

Smelser, scheduled to arrive in Cairo in mid-July herself, never made it to Egypt's capital.

""A week before I was about to leave, my university told me, 'You can't go there, and all the other students there are being evacuated.' ""

At first, Smelser was upset at the decision as she was forced to choose a different city in the Middle East for her internship, but after hearing about the increasing violence in Egypt and growing rage directed at the U.S., she says, ""I'm really glad they didn't let me go.""

""I stick out. I'm very pale, red hair,"" Smelser said, referring to potential threats against Americans. ""I don't look like I belong there.""

Anger against the U.S. government has increased in recent weeks as one political camp accused Washington of backing the Muslim Brotherhood while others said President Obama did little to stop the ouster of Morsi, an Islamist propelled to power by the group.

In late June, Andrew Pochter, 21, a student at Ohio's Kenyon College was killed in mob violence in Alexandria.

Days later, the Washington-based American Councils for International Education evacuated 18 students from the northern coastal city, according to the Associated Press. Fulbright program participants and Center for Arabic Study Abroad fellows were also evacuated, ABC News reported.

But some Americans who have deep roots in Egypt aren't so quick to leave. One of them, Abigail Toner, is almost six months' pregnant.

The 34-year-old, Long Island-born American has lived here for 2½ years. She works for an Egyptian company, is married to an Egyptian man and just moved with her husband across town into a new apartment.

""All these different things … have me here for now,"" Toner said. ""That doesn't mean my husband and I haven't been saying: What's the breaking point?""

Toner said she doesn't feel she is in personal danger, even as a woman in a country where reports of sexual harassment are high and there is widespread anger toward Americans.

""I'm not near any of the things that are going on,"" she said, referring to clashes and protests. ""Because I feel safe, I feel I can keep the baby safe.""

Yosra Brander can't say the same. ""I guess my worry is: It hasn't come into our neighborhood. But is it going to?"" she said.

A Muslim American from the Midwest, Brander moved to Egypt four years ago as a single mom with a job contract, no place to live and $2,000 in her pocket. Now she has an apartment, a husband and ""one of the best jobs you can get"" as a teacher at an international school.

""I've built a life here,"" she said. But in recent weeks, familiar places have turned into sites of violence.

A neighborhood Brander knows as a good place for buying school supplies became the scene of a shooting Friday. An appliance store she just shopped at was looted. And familiar sites have turned into killing zones, like the squares outside Cairo University and Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque, where security forces crushed sit-ins Wednesday.

""Everything is becoming ruined, and I don't want Egypt to get ruined,"" she said. ""I'm worried about what could happen, and nobody knows right now what could happen.""

On Saturday night, as the hours ticked on and security forces patrolled some of the streets, Brammer finally left the safety of the gym, even in light of the curfew. He made it home without any problems.

""The army checkpoint was way chill,"" he wrote in a text message just after midnight local time. ""There were kids playing soccer and riding bikes around it. ... They just said hi to me, and I walked by."""

USA TODAY

About 500 Marines will be based at an air base in southern Spain

Army unit will be based in Djibouti in east Africa

Marines will fly Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft

WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps and Army have developed quick-reaction forces to respond to attacks such as the one in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador.

The Marines will base 500 troops at Moron Air Force Base in Spain, about 35 miles southeast of Seville, said Capt. Eric Flanagan, a Marine Corps spokesman. They can be flown on short notice to African crises aboard six Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.

Those aircraft can take off and land like a helicopter and cruise at more than 300 mph. Two KC-130 tanker aircraft have been dedicated to refuel them in flight, which will expand their reach.

The unit is known as the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force for Crisis Response. It will act as a first responder to U.S. embassies in the region on behalf of U.S. Africa Command, Flanagan said. It will be on standby to help evacuate Americans from hot spots and to provide disaster relief and humanitarian missions.

The Army has developed the East Africa Response Force, which operates under the Combined Joint Task Force — Horn of Africa. Its headquarters are at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. The company-size unit is equipped with aircraft to conduct evacuations and rescue missions in the region.

""Soldiers have been on the ground in Djibouti to support this mission since April and have the capabilities they need to conduct it,"" said. Brig. Gen. Kimberly Field, deputy director of strategy, plans and policy for the Army.

The soldiers for the force come from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Infantry Division based at Fort Riley, Kan.

The Benghazi attack on Sept. 11, 2012, exposed the vulnerability of U.S. outposts in dangerous countries. Although Pentagon officials knew of the attack as it was happening, they lacked forces in the region capable of responding fast enough to help. The consulate was overrun by Islamist militants, killing Ambassador Christopher Stephens. A nearby U.S. facility was also attacked.

The light, quick forces deployed by the Marines and Army are designed to fill that gap in north and east Africa.

""Benghazi really throttled things up,"" Flanagan said. ""Everybody has looked at the threat and decided this is the new normal. We need something more responsive in the North Africa area.""

Benghazi proved that the Pentagon needs to respond quickly to ""flare-ups,"" said Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute and a defense industry consultant. The Marines are his choice for the job.

""This mission should be given to the Marines, because they have Osprey tilt-rotors that can get to fights fast and then land anywhere,"" he said. ""They also have amphibious warships that allow them to act without access to land bases. The Army doesn't have the right equipment for quick-reaction forces in the Mediterranean or Middle East.""

Peter Singer, director for the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution, said there have been about two embassy emergencies or evacuations each year for the past decade, making the Marine and Army quick-reaction forces necessary into the foreseeable future.

They're a ""good idea,"" Singer said. ""The response time at Benghazi was unacceptable. Period."""

Times reports.

A resettlement plan under discussion in Washington and other capitals is aimed at relieving pressure on Middle Eastern countries straining to support 1.6 million refugees, as well as assisting hard-hit Syrian families. The State Department is “ready to consider the idea,” an official from the department said, if the administration receives a formal request from the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which is the usual procedure. The United States usually accepts about half the refugees that the U.N. agency proposes for resettlement. California has historically taken the largest share, but Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia are also popular destinations.

U.N. refugee officials, along with diplomats and non-governmental relief groups, are scheduled to meet in Geneva this week to discuss potential resettlement plans. Germany has already agreed to take 5,000 refugees.

“It was probably inevitable that in this crisis, with these overwhelming numbers, governments would start moving in this direction,” Lavinia Limon, chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a Virginia-based advocacy and service group, told the L.A. Times. Limon added, “But there will be resistance.”

Congress is unlikely to warm up to the idea of agreeing to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees into the U.S. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who are currently pushing immigration reform bills, particularly aimed at Latinos who are in the country illegally, will need to explain why they may favor or oppose resettling thousands of Syrian refugees.

It should be noted that Congress resisted accepting Iraqi refugees in 2003 following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Between 1983 and 2009, the U.S. resettled a total of 76,205 Iraqis. Meanwhile, seventy percent of total refugees in the U.S. were on food stamps in 2009. Within that number, 95 percent of Iraqi refugees were food stamp recipients. Additionally, the report shows an unemployment rate of 46 percent in 2009 among Iraqi refugees. A total of 219 Syrian refugees were resettled in the U.S. between 1983 and 2009.

More importantly, President Obama’s administration supports Syrians who are attempting to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad, but the emergence of Islamic extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda among the Syrian opposition presents a serious security concern. The L.A. Times alludes to the potential danger with such a resettlement:

Homeland security officials require careful vetting of refugees, with multiple interviews and background checks before they are allowed to enter the country. Under normal circumstances, the screening process can take a year or longer. U.S. officials are likely to be extra careful with Syrian refugees. As Islamic militants take a more prominent role in the rebel forces, officials worry about fighters with Al Qaeda ties trying to enter the country. Two resettled Iraqis were convicted of trying to send arms to Al Qaeda from their home in Bowling Green, Ky.

New National Security Advisor Susan Rice and President Obama’s nominee for U.N. ambassador Samantha Power are both refugee advocates and will likely push for the resettlement."

Mr. Kerry made the announcement at a meeting with foreign ministers from Western and Middle Eastern nations that was convened here to decide how to help the opposition in Syria’s bitter civil war, which has killed more than 70,000 people.

A portion of the new American aid, the State Department said, will help provide additional “nonlethal” supplies to the military wing of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, an umbrella organization formed in November to unite the various rebel groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad for two years.

American officials did not specify the items to be sent, saying that will be determined in consultation with the coalition. But the Obama administration has been considering providing military equipment like body armor and night-vision goggles."

Why not pitch reality show with a Kardashian: Project Runway, where object is to get on one

Ecuador, Venezuala still asylum possibilities. Choose Venezuela: great beaches, B&Bs

Obeidallah: Take a page from Clapper, who misled Congress under oath: Just say you're sorry

Edward Snowden , you need help! And I'm here for you. I enjoy offering people suggestions -- which you may even be aware of if you read my e-mails when you were working at the NSA.

I don't know where you thought you'd end up after disclosing classified documents detailing our government's surveillance program, but I doubt you thought you'd be roaming the halls of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport checking out the wide range of restaurants there -- the Russian cuisine at ""Mama Rashas;"" maybe the Burger King or the restaurant in Terminal D called, ""Hippopotamus"" -- which, I think you'll agree, is a horrible name for a place that serves food.

It must drive you crazy to know that the airport even offers a fear-of-flying treatment center for people afraid to fly while you are still begging for just a seat in coach. I know you grow bored browsing for hours at the duty-free shop, wishing you had a plane ticket so you could at least buy tax-free caviar or vodka.

So Edward, I want to propose some creative suggestions that you may find helpful.

Dean Obeidallah

1. If you can't get out of airport, pitch a reality show about being stuck there. It could be an international version of ""Project Runway"" -- how to get on one. How hard could it be to get a Kardashian to sign on?

2. At this writing, you have applied for asylum in -- depending on whom you ask -- 21 countries . WikiLeaks claimed Friday that you have applied to six additional unidentified countries, and the Venezuelan president said that he was ready to take you, according to reports. Bolivia appears to be following suit. That would be a break, because with some of these other nations you clearly have no shot. It's not unlike when I was graduating high school with mediocre grades and applied to Harvard. Barring a clerical error, I was not getting in and I'd say it's the same for you. So say goodbye to countries like Germany, Italy, and Spain.

But it appears you've got ""safety school"" nations: Venezuela, Bolivia, maybe Ecuador. You may end up getting into several, but which do you pick?

Here's my take. Forget legal issues, like extradition treaties. What will really matter to your quality of life is what people have said about those two countries on Expedia.com and Trip adviser.

For example: Sure, Ecuador offers a quaint old section of its capital, Quito, which does look picturesque. But Venezuela offers more. For starters, TripAdvisor tells us about a great selection of bed-and-breakfasts in Caracas, the best rated being the Beuenavista Inn. People noted online that it's ""nice and cozy,"" close to the airport and has free Wi-Fi -- which, word has it , is something you would really treasure. And I'll bet you could get a great deal on Priceline for this place.

And listen, the city has terrific restaurants, with many raves for the Maute Grill -- a steakhouse with an extensive late-night menu, for those sleepless nights spent looking over your shoulder. Also if you get bored in Caracas, there are always the beautiful beaches of Playa el Aguan where few will recognize you because everyone looks different with their clothes off.

JUST WATCHED Snowden's name used to sell lingerie Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Snowden's name used to sell lingerie 02:10

JUST WATCHED What will Edward Snowden do next? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What will Edward Snowden do next? 01:53

But don't limit youself! Why not consider asylum in a few countries you have not applied to yet? For example: Egypt. Sure it seems a bit unstable now but who will notice you entering? Plus, I'm friendly with comedian/talk show host Bassem Youssef, the ""Jon Stewart of Egypt."" No promises, but I think I can get you on his show.

There's also Turkmenistan -- J-Lo just sang there last week, so apparently they will allow anyone enter the country.

3. Another option: Return to America and face the criminal charges against you. You could possibly win the case or be offered an acceptable plea deal.

Or you can follow the lead of James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence. When Clapper was questioned under oath by Congress in March about whether the National Security Agency collects ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans,"" he answered ""no...not wittingly."" Obviously the documents you leaked show that Clapper was being less than fully honest with Congress.

BUT, this week he defended his misleading answer to Congress by stating: ""My response was clearly erroneous - - for which I apologize.""

So just say you're sorry. It seems to have worked out well for Clapper, because congressional leaders are not calling for him to be criminally prosecuted. Instead, they are just focused on pursuing you for revealing details about the spying program that Clapper was hiding from Congress.

So, Edward, you have a lot of options. Give it some thought. Maybe while enjoying some ""pan seared pot stickers"" at the T. G. I. Friday's in Terminal F.

But don't take too long, because I sense that you're just like the friend you let stay on your couch while he gets his life in order. Soon the Russians will soon want you to crash somewhere else."
http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-meets-karzai-u-troops-2014-150844683--politics.html,,[],"Obama, Karzai: Afghans taking charge sooner than planned","President Barack Obama and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan agreed after talks at the White House on Friday to slightly speed up the process that calls for American and other NATO forces to leave that war-torn country by late 2014. But Obama hedged on the much-discussed possibility of a U.S. military presence after that benchmark date.

The training of Afghan forces and the battleground successes against Islamist insurgents have gone well enough to meet NATO-set withdrawal goals and “accelerate them somewhat,” Obama said at a joint press conference with Karzai.

“Make no mistake: Our path is clear and we are moving forward,” Obama said. “Next year, this long war will come to a responsible end.”

The American president, who campaigned on his plan to end America’s involvement in what is now the country’s longest war, said he would collect advice from the Pentagon and military commanders on the ground “in the coming weeks” on how quickly U.S. forces can come home without risking hard-earned security gains. He would then announce the next phase of the pullout “in the coming months.”

Obama hedged on one of the most serious points of contention between the uneasy allies: The prospects of leaving a residual force beyond 2014 that would train Afghan troops and conduct counterterrorism operations. He declined to discuss the possible size of such a deployment and pointedly left open the possibility that America might leave entirely if the Afghan government does not agree to give U.S. troops immunity from prosecution.

“From my perspective at least, it will not be possible for us to have any kind of U.S. troops presence post-2014” without such an arrangement, Obama said.

Karzai, who had previously been wary of supporting immunity, said the talks at the White House had removed lingering obstacles regarding the custody of detainees and the nature of NATO-led operations.

“I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised,” he said. As to how many forces should stay, Karzai added, “That’s not for us [Afghans] to decide.""

Story continues

There are about 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Afghan forces lead about 80 percent of security operations.

Was the war, which is now deeply unpopular with the U.S. public, worth fighting?

“It was absolutely the right thing,” said Obama, to invade Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist strikes to hunt down Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and to ensure Afghanistan could not be used as a base to strike America again.

“We achieved our central goal—or have come very close to achieving our central goal—which is to decapitate al-Qaida, to dismantle it, to make sure that they can’t attack us again,” he said.

“At the end of this conflict, we are going to be able to say that the sacrifices that were made by those men and women in uniform has brought about the goal that we sought,"" the president added.

Obama had been asked whether the war was worth the hundreds of billions of dollars and thousands of U.S., NATO and Afghan deaths since the October 2001 invasion, especially given the now-abandoned dreams of fostering a vibrant democracy.

“Have we achieved everything that some might have imagined us achieving in the best of scenarios? Probably not. This is a human enterprise and, you know, you fall short of the ideal,” Obama acknowledged. “Did we achieve our central goal, and have we been able, I think, to shape a strong relationship with a responsible Afghan government that is willing to cooperate with us to make sure that it is not a launching pad for future attacks against the United States?

“We have achieved that goal; we are in the process of achieving that goal,” he said.

Obama also gave his strongest show of support yet for Afghan-led reconciliation talks including the Taliban Islamist militia, giving his approval to the establishment of a Taliban office in Doha, Qatar, for the purposes of the negotiations.

When Obama campaigned for re-election on a promise to end the war, he vowed that ""the war in Afghanistan is ending"" at one of his final rallies.

""We are leaving. We are leaving in 2014, period,” Vice President Joe Biden said in his debate with Republican rival Paul Ryan.

Except … maybe not. The Obama administration has been negotiating with Karzai on a possible residual fighting force—a notion that’s always been part of the White House’s strategy, just not necessarily one that it has highlighted. When Obama traveled to Afghanistan in May 2012, a senior administration official told reporters that any fighting force left there after 2014 would focus on “very specific, narrow missions” like counterterrorism and training Afghan troops.

Before Friday’s talks, both sides seemed to be in a negotiating posture. Senior Obama national security aide Ben Rhodes got headlines this week by saying that Americans might leave entirely (White House press secretary Jay Carney said roughly the same thing in late November).

Karzai took a tough line on the issue in an early December interview with NBC News, saying he had written to Obama to say NATO-led forces would have to leave entirely unless the U.S. turns over hundreds of detainees held at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and a nearby facility.

Obama aides have long trumpeted the pullout from Iraq as a major foreign policy victory. But that came about in part because of the collapse of negotiations over maintaining an American presence there. The Iraqi government refused to give U.S. forces immunity from prosecution—a deal breaker for Washington. Just weeks ago, Karzai was noncommittal.

""We can consider that question. I can go to the Afghan people and argue for it,"" Karzai told NBC. ""But before I do that, the United States of America must make absolutely sure that they respect Afghanistan's sovereignty, that they respect Afghanistan's laws, that no Afghan is hurt or his or her rights violated by U.S. soldiers."""

""Arming the rebels -- that's an option,"" Hagel said at a Pentagon news conference.

Asked directly if the administration was reconsidering its opposition to that option, Hagel said ""yes.""

The comment cracks the door open, if only a little, to the U.S. getting more involved in the bloody Syria war.

President Obama, speaking separately at a press conference in the middle of a trip to Mexico, said Thursday that Hagel's remarks were ""what I've been saying now for months."" Obama said the U.S. still needs to ""look before we leap,"" and make sure any steps the country takes serve to advance the cause of regime change.

The administration last week revealed that U.S. intelligence found evidence that the regime used chemical weapons, specifically sarin, ""on a small scale"" in Syria. The White House, however, stressed that investigators would need to find out more about how that nerve gas was released before acting on that intelligence.

Obama has long called the use of chemical weapons in Syria a ""red line"" that could prompt U.S. action if crossed.

Hagel said Thursday that the U.S. must ""rethink all options,"" though ""it doesn't mean you do or you will"" use those options.

""These are options that must be considered with partners, with the international community,"" he said.

At the same news conference, British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said his government has not yet provided arms to the Syrian rebels but would not rule it out. He also said it appears the regime is ""largely in control of its chemical weapons"" sites.

The administration could be faced with several options if it chooses to get more involved in the Syria conflict. Some have called for the establishment of a no-fly zone, and even limited air strikes, but arming the opposition could represent a middle ground. Some lawmakers have been urging the administration for months to take that step.

Obama, in a press conference Tuesday, warned against ""rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence.""

He said it's important to move forward ""in a prudent way.""

Schumer, awakened from a nap in his office, bounded to the Senate floor, staff in tow. It was approaching 2 a.m. The New Yorker joined fellow Democratic Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who was presiding wearily over an almost empty chamber.

The two senators and six others, Republicans and Democrats, had finished writing the most comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws in a generation. Now the bill was ready to be introduced.

“I would like to thank everybody ... who worked so hard on this great legislation whose voyage begins now,” Schumer said.

On the marble stairs outside the chamber, the senators and bleary-eyed staff who had brokered the deal gathered around. They gave a thumbs-up. It was a picture-perfect moment.

That unity will be tested this week as the Senate opens debate on the historic bill and the eight senators face the sobering task of bringing more colleagues on board.

Immigration reform has eluded Congress in the decades since President Reagan signed the last substantial overhaul. But this time may be different. Top Republicans have begun to join Democrats in supporting a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally.

With a vote to start debate set for Tuesday, the legislation faces a gantlet of amendments that could attract needed Republicans or upset the delicate balance celebrated that night on the Senate steps.

“Look, I always thought there were land mines along here, and you just got to go through them,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who led the last failed attempt at immigration reform and is one of the key players in this one. “It’s not a smooth path.”

The bill has so far threaded past those land mines. How the bill’s authors handled them illustrates their determination to succeed as well as the risks that they could fail.

Border security has long been a partisan battleground.

Republicans want an impermeable southern border to prevent illegal entries; Democrats view that as an unrealistic goal that will stall other changes, including the path to citizenship for those lacking proper papers.

One crucial Republican in the bipartisan group, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, has never been completely satisfied with the border security agreement he worked out with the other senators.

The night before the bill was introduced in April, Rubio and his staff met with an influential critic. Chris Crane, president of the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a federal immigration and customs officers union, was told to come alone.

As written, the legislation provides $4.5 billion for more drones, 3,500 customs officers and a double-layer fence in some areas along the border, with the goal of stopping 90% of illegal entries. Once the plan is in place, immigrants who pay fines, work and learn English will be eligible in 10 years for permanent legal status. After 13 years, they can become citizens.

Crane had blasted the senators for not consulting his union. He believed the deal was riddled with loopholes that would prevent agents from deporting immigrants in the country unlawfully.

In Rubio’s office, along with a handful of staffers and Rubio, Crane argued for an enhanced exit system with biometric screening, such as checking the fingerprints of foreign travelers. About 40% of those in the country illegally stayed on expired visas.

Rubio mentioned that his fingerprints are scanned when he visits Disney World.

At Rubio’s urging, the Judiciary Committee added a provision that would launch a pilot biometric exit program at 30 of the nation’s busiest airports.

Senators are now seriously considering a proposal from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) to expand the exit system to all airports; opponents point out that the cost would be enormous.

Cornyn is just the type of Republican the bill’s authors want to bring on board. He’s a border-state senator familiar with the problems of the immigration system and sensitive to the growing Latino electorate. The chamber’s No. 2 Republican, he would provide momentum not just in the Senate, but in the House, where the conservative majority has been cool to the effort.

Advertisement

But some Democrats wonder if Cornyn is just dangling the possibility of support. He wants an additional $1 billion a year for more drones, 10,000 officers and other equipment. That is a nonstarter for Democrats and raises alarms for deficit hawks.

“It’s such an un-Republican idea to throw money at a problem,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the bill’s authors. “We’re not going to be able to add billions and billions of dollars in cost unless you can justify and find a way to pay for it.”

Advertisement

In exchange for the path to citizenship, deals were cut to stem future illegal immigration by dramatically expanding guest-worker programs, including for farm laborers and highly skilled professionals.

But these compacts reached in backroom talks between business and labor have come under fire from opponents who say they taint the bill, which has grown from 844 pages to 1,077.

Advertisement

Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is leading the Republican opposition, said, “I’m not sure that’s the right thing to do … to have some secret agreement reached with a group of people we hardly know trump the ability to do the right thing for the American people.”

One of those deals, for a new visa for low-skill jobs such as maids and gardeners, proved so volatile it almost blew up the immigration overhaul. And it remains a top roadblock in the House.

Advertisement

Senate Democrats also have demands that could torpedo the bill. Among the most fraught is their desire to allow gay Americans to obtain visas for foreign-born spouses, as heterosexual couples can.

The measure would keep a promise to gay rights advocates, but chase off Republican votes.

Democrats hope the Supreme Court will make that issue moot by striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act this month. If it doesn’t, they will face an agonizing choice.

It was a clear sign from the Kremlin that it has tired of the international standoff over Snowden, the 30-year-old former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed classified information about widespread U.S. surveillance of worldwide telephone and Internet contacts.

“Venezuela is waiting for an answer from Snowden,” Alexei Pushkov, head of the Russian parliament’s international affairs committee, said on Twitter. “This, perhaps, is his last chance to receive political asylum.”

In a separate tweet, Pushkov noted that Snowden “shouldn’t live in Sheremetyevo,” Moscow’s main international airport where the fugitive has been stuck in a transit area for two weeks.

Snowden arrived to Moscow on a flight from Hong Kong on June 23. But his U.S. passport had been revoked after Justice Department officials brought espionage charges against him and sought his extradition. That has prevented him from proceeding through passport control and officially entering Russian territory. The airport corridors and holding areas between the arrival gates and the immigration booths staffed by border guards comprise a diplomatic no-man’s land from which an undocumented person can neither enter nor depart.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced Friday that his country was offering “humanitarian asylum” to Snowden so that he can live without “persecution from the empire,” a reference to the United States.

On Saturday, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua told reporters in Caracas that his office had not yet been in contact with Russian authorities but expected to be in touch Monday.

For Snowden to leave for Caracas, diplomats at the Venezuelan Embassy in Moscow would have to provide him with travel papers before he could board flights headed for South America. There are no scheduled direct Moscow-to-Caracas flights and most connections are through the United States, Spain or other countries that would put Snowden at risk of arrest during a stopover. However, Aeroflot and Cuba’s Avianca have direct flights from Moscow to Havana, from where he could easily travel on to Caracas.

Venezuela is one of three countries that have offered asylum to Snowden. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced at the same time as Maduro his country’s willingness to take in the fugitive “if conditions allow,” and Bolivian President Evo Morales extended an offer Saturday. Morales said the move was in retaliation for European countries’ denying his plane entry to their airspace last week as he traveled back to La Paz from Moscow. Spain, Italy, France and Portugal reportedly had been informed by unknown U.S. sources that Snowden was on board Morales’ plane.

Pushkov’s comments on Twitter and in an interview with Voice of Russia radio appeared to signal the Kremlin’s desire for Snowden to move on. President Vladimir Putin last week said that Snowden was welcome to settle in Russia but only if he ceased leaking classified information that was damaging to “our American partners.” That prompted Snowden to withdraw his application for asylum in Russia.

U.S. officials are believed to have informed the countries to which Snowden directed asylum appeals -- 27 in all, according to WikiLeaks -- that sheltering the fugitive from U.S. prosecution would damage their relations with Washington and imperil trade and other mutually advantageous agreements.

Pushkov observed that Venezuela already has “a sharp conflict” with the United States and “it won’t be worse” for defying the U.S. extradition request and providing a safe haven for Snowden.

The planned removal of more than 40,000 troops and the closure of dozens of bases over the next year will shrink the protective umbrella for U.S. officials to keep tabs on construction work, training programs and other initiatives in the corruption-plagued nation. Only about 20 percent of the country will be accessible to U.S. civilian oversight personnel in 2014, according to an analysis conducted by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction and obtained by The Washington Post.

Instead of curtailing those projects, the Pentagon, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development plan to rely on teams of private contractors to monitor the work of other private contractors on the taxpayer-funded projects. In a document soliciting firms to help with inspections, USAID said it also intends to use satellite photos and “crowdsourcing” experiments that will solicit feedback on progress from Afghans who are supposed to benefit from U.S.-financed work.

The inability of U.S. government personnel to inspect development projects is prompting worry among lawmakers and government inspectors that millions more dollars could be squandered in what has become the costliest reconstruction of a single country in American history.

“I would be shocked if this doesn’t have an unhappy ending,” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who has been critical of reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. “They are kissing oversight goodbye.”

View Graphic U.S. government overseers will lose much of their access to large, government-funded projects in Afghanistan.

By plotting some of the largest civilian and military projects on a map generated by the inspector general’s office, The Post found that at least 15 major reconstruction initiatives, projected to cost more than $1 billion, are expected to be beyond the reach of U.S. government personnel next year. Among them are two of the U.S. government’s signature development endeavors: the $75 million installation of a new turbine at a dam in the southwest and part of the area where a $230 million highway is being built in the east.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is building three garrisons for the Afghan army — each costing between $60 million and $80 million — in parts of the country that are outside the sectors identified by the inspector general as accessible.

“Many of these projects will never be seen by an American government employee, and that’s a concern,” said John F. Sopko, the special inspector general. “We need to ensure that tax dollars for these programs are properly spent.”

On-site monitoring by State, USAID and the Pentagon, as well as audits by inspectors general, led to dozens of projects being redesigned or scaled back over the past few years.

The ability of civilian government officials and military personnel to visit projects depends on the proximity of troops to respond to an attack — and on the ability of medical personnel to transport the wounded to coalition hospitals within an hour. As U.S. troops pull back to a handful of bases next year, travel will be circumscribed to areas within the radius of a 30-minute helicopter flight from those facilities.

Those areas almost certainly will shrink further by the end of next year. President Obama has not yet decided how many troops, if any, he will keep in Afghanistan in 2015 and beyond — he is waiting for the Afghan government to approve a security agreement with the United States — but even under the Pentagon’s most optimistic scenarios, the remaining U.S. forces would be clustered in just four or five bases.

The largest part of the reconstruction effort involves training and equipping Afghan security forces, a task that is expected to cost about $4 billion next year — the exact figure is awaiting congressional approval — and almost as much in following years. Over the past several years, U.S. military officers have been able to assess whether funds provided in Kabul, the capital, for salaries, fuel and equipment filtered down to troops on the front lines because American battalions often operated in partnership with Afghan ones.

With fewer troops in the field, the Pentagon is planning to increase the number of civilian advisers assigned to the defense and interior ministries. Those advisers will work with the Afghans to create new systems to track military property and other items paid for by the United States, a senior U.S. defense official said.

“The goal is to install a method of accountability,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Pentagon has not yet provided a formal response to queries on the subject posed by Sopko.

The official also said the Pentagon would seek to place more responsibility on the Afghan government to track the use of U.S. funds. “We’ve told them that it’s incumbent on them to be good stewards of the resources given to them,” the official said.

A senior USAID official said the agency is confident that it can adequately monitor its work without U.S. military protection. “This isn’t anything new for USAID,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. “Most of AID’s work is done in the absence of a military presence.”

The agency is seeking to hire firms to design and implement a program to inspect reconstruction projects across the country. It anticipates spending $200 million on the effort.

“As the military draws down and our field presence diminishes, USAID will lose most, if not all, of its field staff . . . and experience drastically reduced mobility around Afghanistan,” the agency wrote in a contracting solicitation. “This constraint limits USAID officials from adequately monitoring program activities as they are occurring in the field.”

USAID is looking to hire contractors who can send Afghans with engineering and program-monitoring skills into areas beyond the reach of U.S. medical evacuation flights to collect information on development projects, including photographs with time stamps and precise geographic coordinates. The agency also is seeking to have the contractors create “monitoring tasks that the general public can objectively perform — commonly referred to as ‘crowd-sourcing.’ ”

The USAID official said the agency intends to use other methods, including video-conferences with construction teams and satellite photographs, to corroborate the work performed by the contractors. “We intend to rely on a multiplicity of layered approaches,” the official said.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also said it plans to use contractors to monitor inaccessible projects.

But others involved in Afghan reconstruction voiced skepticism that satellite imagery and field reports from Afghans hired by a private contractor would be sufficient. “It’s difficult even for Afghans to inspect some of these projects,” said a U.S. reconstruction specialist. “If they’re walking around with a camera and a notebook, they’ll draw attention to themselves as someone connected with Western money.”

In a July report to Congress, Sopko, the inspector general, said his office is concerned that third-party monitors “may raise new issues such as vetting, accuracy, effectiveness, and accountability.”

Among those most affected by the travel restrictions will be Sopko and his auditors, who may not be able to conduct field inspections that can be used to sanction contractors or pursue criminal prosecutions. In a letter he sent this month to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Sopko noted that earlier this year, his inspectors were unable to visit infrastructure projects in northern Afghanistan valued at $72 million “because they are located in areas that could not be reached by U.S. civilian employees.”

“Sopko is in a very difficult position,” McCaskill said. His auditors “can’t do their job adequately if they can’t be on the ground.”

Security Council voted unanimously Thursday for tough new sanctions to punish North Korea for its latest nuclear test, and a furious Pyongyang threatened a nuclear strike against the United States.

The sanctions drafted by North Korea's closest ally, China, and the United States send a powerful message that the international community condemns Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear tests -- and repeated violations of Security Council resolutions.

""Adoption of the resolution itself is not enough,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Li Baodong said. ""We want to see full implementation of the resolution."" Li also urged calm and a resumption of the stalled six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.

""The top priority now is to defuse the tensions, bring down heat ... bring the situation back on the track of diplomacy, on negotiations,"" Li said.

Immediately before the vote, an unidentified spokesman for Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said the North will exercise its right for ""a preemptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors"" because Washington is ""set to light a fuse for a nuclear war.""

The statement was carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency, which issued no immediate comment after the Security Council vote.

In Pyongyang, Army Gen. Kang Pyo Yong told a crowd of tens of thousands that North Korea is ready to fire long-range nuclear-armed missiles at Washington, which ""will be engulfed in a sea of fire.""

The White House responded by saying the U.S. is fully capable of defending itself against a North Korea ballistic missile attack.

Although North Korea boasts of nuclear bombs and pre-emptive strikes, it is not thought to have mastered the ability to produce a warhead small enough to put on a missile capable of reaching the U.S. It is believed to have enough nuclear fuel, however, for several crude nuclear devices.

The United States has long been concerned that North Korea could eventually pose a missile threat to U.S. territory. The Defense Department first began to operate a ground-based missile defense system in late 2004 with such a potential threat in mind.

""Taken together, these sanctions will bite, and bite hard,"" U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said after the vote.

""North Korea must wake up from its delusion of becoming a ... nuclear weapons state and make the right choice,"" said South Korea's U.N. Ambassador Kim Sook said. ""It can either take the right path toward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual self-destruction.""

Tensions have escalated following a rocket launch by Pyongyang in December and its third nuclear test on Feb. 12. Both acts defied three Security Council resolutions that bar North Korea from testing or using nuclear or ballistic missile technology and from importing or exporting material for these programs.

The new sanctions resolution is the fourth against North Korea since its first nuclear test in 2006.

It condemns the latest nuclear test ""in the strongest terms"" for violating and flagrantly disregarding council resolutions. It bans further ballistic missile launches, nuclear tests ""or any other provocation"" and demands that North Korea return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It condemns all of North Korea's ongoing nuclear activities, including its uranium enrichment.

But the resolution also stresses the council's commitment ""to a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution"" to North Korea's nuclear program and urges a resumption of six-party talks.

The success of new sanctions could depend on enforcement by China, where most of the companies and banks that North Korea is believed to work with are based.

The resolution strengthens inspections of suspicious cargo heading to and from the country and calls on states to step up ""vigilance"" of possible illegal activity by North Korean diplomats. In a measure targeted at the reclusive nation's ruling elite, the resolution bans all nations from exporting expensive jewelry, yachts, luxury automobiles and racing cars to the North.

All countries would now be required to freeze financial transactions or services that could contribute to North Korea's nuclear or missile programs.

The resolution identifies three individuals, one corporation and one organization that will be added to the U.N. sanctions list. The targets include top officials at a company that is the country's primary arms dealer and main exporter of ballistic missile-related equipment, and a national organization responsible for research and development of missiles and probably nuclear weapons.

To get around financial sanctions, North Koreans have been carrying around large suitcases filled with cash to move illicit funds. The resolution expresses concern that these bulk cash transfers may be used to evade sanctions.

The resolution also bans all countries from providing public financial support for trade deals, such as granting export credits, guarantees or insurance, if the assistance could contribute to the North's nuclear or missile programs.

It includes what a senior diplomat called unprecedented new travel sanctions that would require countries to expel agents working for sanctioned North Korean companies.

The resolution also requires states to inspect suspect cargo on their territory and prevent any vessel that refuses an inspection from entering their ports. And a new aviation measure calls on states to deny aircraft permission to take off, land or fly over their territory if illicit cargo is suspected to be aboard."

By Fareed Zakaria

So, the Obama administration has now decided that Syria’s use of chemical weapons crosses a red line and, as a result, the United States will supply the opposition with small arms and ammunition. This strikes me as a risky decision – too little to have a real impact and enough to commit the United States in a complex civil war.

First, let’s be clear. This will not ease the humanitarian nightmare unfolding in Syria. The opposition forces will now have some more arms and will fight back, presumably killing more of the regime’s soldiers and supporters. Levels of violence might well rise not decline.

So what exactly is the objective of this policy shift? Is it the defeat of Bashar al-Assad? If so, can such a small shift in American support for the opposition really do that? The opposition forces are disorganized. Joshua Landis, the Syria scholar, estimates that there are 1,000 militias that make up the rebel forces. Such a decentralized opposition would need a lot more than more small weapons and ammunition to succeed.

If they did succeed, that would be a good outcome. But it will almost certainly mean that the various militias would then begin a massacre of the Alawites, the sect that the al-Assad regime comes from. It is unclear what would happen to the Christians and Kurds, who have tended to stay neutral in this conflict, but they too might feel the wrath of newly empowered Sunni militias. The Alawites, Christians, and Kurds collectively make up about a third of Syrians, so this could become an even-larger, many-cornered struggle. Remember, with 180,000 troops in Iraq, we could not stop massacres, ethnic cleansing and massive human rights violations. We are now planning to achieve lofty ends with almost no means.

More from GPS: Why Obama needs to act on Syria

The most likely scenario is that this small step up in American assistance will not make much difference. At that point, pressure will build on the Obama administration. Sen. John McCain will make speeches saying that now, America’s credibility is on the line. Having supported the opposition, we have to ensure that they succeed. The administration will face a choice between seeming ineffectual or plunging deeper into a complex and bloody civil war.

It’s possible that the administration can just stand pat and do the little that it is doing. That could be a brutal but effective strategy to bleed America’s enemies. Contrary to much of the media commentary, the fact that Iran and Hezbollah are sending militias, arms, and money into Syria is not a sign of strength. It is a sign that they are worried that the Syrian regime might fall and are desperately seeking to shore it up. Keeping them engaged and pouring resources into Syria weakens them substantially. But can the United States pursue such a cold-blooded strategy of realpolitik?

Former President Bill Clinton recently said that he favored some American intervention because “Sometimes it's just best to get caught trying, as long as you don't overcommit.” That suggests that supporters of interventions see it as some kind of symbolic policy, to show that we care. But it is like trying to get a little bit pregnant. The outcome is rarely what you want."

I am no fan Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA), who chaired yesterday's congressional hearing, or of Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC), who dramatically claimed the hearing's revelations would be ""every bit as damaging as Watergate."" Congress has muddled the question of whether Hicks is a whistleblower by politicizing Hicks' testimony to the Nth degree, but remove it from the politicization, and the question of whether or not he is a whistleblower is not complicated.

According to the facts reported, Hicks meets the legal definition of a whistleblower.

Contrary to the government's common claims about who is and is not a whistleblower, the government does not get to make that determination. One becomes a whistleblower by operation of law by making a disclosure that reasonably evidences gross waste, fraud, abuse of power, mismanagement, illegality or a danger to health and public safety.

Hicks' testimony disclosed what reasonably evidences abuse of power (misleading the public about the attacks), mismanagement (in responding to the attacks), and danger to health in public safety (his assertions that the U.S. could have sent rescue teams earlier). He also suffered two forms of classic whistleblower retaliation: a demotion and negative performance review."

NPR reports on the completion of the unlikely “Megatons to Megawatts” program under which the U.S. spent $17 billion since 1993 buying 500 tons of downgraded nuclear fuel culled from old Russian bombs then sold to commercial energy interests in America for use in their own reactors.

""The Megatons to Megawatts program made a substantial contribution both to the elimination of nuclear weapons material and to nuclear energy generation in the United States,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reportedly said upon the official conclusion of the historic program. ""Nearly every commercial nuclear reactor in the United States received nuclear fuel under the program.""

And Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, calls the program one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in history.

""I mean, think about it – 20,000 bombs' worth of nuclear material, destroyed forever,"" he told NPR. ""[Bombs that] will never threaten anybody ever again.""

World Nuclear News reports that with the arrival of the final shipment of nuclear fuel – four cylinders worth – in Baltimore Harbor earlier this month from St. Petersburg, the program will now continue, albeit in a modified form.

Techsnabexport, or Tenex, a subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom, will now reportedly supply nuclear fuel to a private U.S. company for distribution.

However, that fuel will originate from Russia's commercial enrichment of uranium, rather than the systematic transformation of former weapons materials.

The Megatons to Megawatts program is rooted in the aftermath of the former Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

Philip Sewell tells NPR that shortly after the political situation unraveled, he visited old U.S.S.R. military facilities on behalf of the U.S. Dept. of Energy.

""Windows were broken, gates were not locked, and there were very few people around,"" Sewell reportedly said, adding that the porous conditions provided ample opportunity for the potential theft of nuclear materials.

The solution was the Megatons to Megawatts program, or one the Russians initially rejected, but soon thereafter accepted in order to secure badly needed funds during what was then a time of national crisis.

""It was a matter of pride, principle and patriotism,"" Sewell told NPR. ""Even though they didn't need that excess material, [and] they didn't have the money to protect it, they didn't want to let go of it."""

Speaking to reporters during a previously unannounced trip to Baghdad, Kerry said that he and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had engaged in ""a very spirited discussion"" on the Iranian flights, which U.S. officials believe are ferrying weapons and fighters intended for the embattled Syrian government.

Kerry said the plane shipments — along with material being trucked across Iraqi territory from Iran to Syria — were helping President Bashar Assad's regime cling to power by increasing their ability to strike at Syrian rebels and opposition figures demanding Assad's ouster.

""I made it very clear that for those of us who are engaged in an effort to see President Assad step down and to see a democratic process take hold ... anything that supports President Assad is problematic,"" Kerry said at a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after meeting separately with Maliki at his office. ""And I made it very clear to the Prime Minister that the overflights from Iran are, in fact, helping to sustain President Assad and his regime.""

The overflights in Iraq have long been a source of contention between the U.S. and Iraq. Iraq and Iran claim the flights are carrying humanitarian goods, but American officials say they are confident that the planes are being used to arm the support the Assad regime. The administration is warning Iraq that unless action is taken, Iraq will be excluded from the international discussion about Syria's political future.

U.S. officials say that in the absence of a complete ban on flights, Washington would at least like the planes to land and be inspected in Iraq to ensure that they are carrying humanitarian supplies. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton secured a pledge from Iraq to inspect the flights last year, but since then only two aircraft have been checked by Iraqi authorities, according to U.S. officials.

One senior U.S. official traveling with Kerry said the sheer number of overflights, which occur ""close to daily,"" along with shipments trucked to Syria from Iran through Iraq, was inconsistent with claims they are only carrying humanitarian supplies. The official said it was in Iraq's interest to prevent the situation in Syria from deteriorating further, particularly as there are fears that al-Qaida-linked extremists may gain a foothold in the country as the Assad regime falters.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said there are clear links between al-Qaida linked extremists operating in Syria and militants who are also carrying out terrorist attacks in Iraqi territory with increasing regularity.

Kerry's comments in Baghdad come as U.S. lawmakers are calling for President Barack Obama to do more to stop the bloodshed in Syria, including possible airstrikes against Assad's aircraft fleet.

The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, said Sunday the U.S. should create a ""safe zone"" in northern Syria that would give the U.S. more leverage with opposition forces.

""This doesn't mean the 101st Airborne Division and ships"" are deployed, Rogers told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ''It means small groups with special capabilities reengaging the opposition so we can vet them, train them, equip them so they can be an effective fighting force.""

Last week, Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., asked Obama in a letter to step up U.S. military efforts in the region, including destroying Assad's aircraft using precision airstrikes.

Kerry said Iraq's tacit approval of Iranian overflights left the American people wondering how an ally would undermine U.S. efforts, particularly after the enormous sacrifices made by the United States in liberating Iraq from Saddam Hussein's tyrannical rule.

""There are members of Congress and people in America who increasingly are watching what Iraq is doing and wondering how it is that a partner in the efforts for democracy and a partner for whom Americans feel they have tried so hard to be helpful, how that country can be, in fact, doing something that makes it more difficult to achieve our common goals, the goal expressed by the prime minister with respect to Syria and President Assad,"" he said.

In addition to the overflights, Kerry said he had urged Maliki and other Iraqi officials to promote unity amid a spike in sectarian violence and called on them to ensure that upcoming provincial elections are free and fair. Kerry said the postponement of the polls in two provinces — Anbar and Ninevah — was unacceptable and should be reversed.

""We strongly urge the prime minister to take this issue to the cabinet and to see if it can be revisited, because we believe very strongly that everybody needs to vote simultaneously,"" he said.

In addition to his meeting with Maliki, Kerry saw Iraqi parliament speaker parliament speaker Osama al-Nujaifi, a Sunni, whose faction is at odds with Maliki's Shiia. Kerry also spoke by phone with Massoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdish Regional Government based in Irbil to encourage the Kurds not go ahead with unilateral actions — especially involving oil, like a pipeline deal with Turkey.

Kerry arrived in Baghdad from Amman, where he had been accompanying President Barack Obama on his tour of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan. His visit to Iraq is the first by a U.S. secretary of state since Clinton went in April 2009. During Obama's first term, the Iraq portfolio was largely delegated to Vice President Joe Biden as Obama wound down the war."

Karzai made the deal with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in Tehran Sunday.

""Afghanistan agreed on a long-term friendship and cooperation pact with Iran,"" Karzai's spokesman Aimal Faizi said, according to Reuters. ""The pact will be for long-term political, security, economic and cultural cooperation, regional peace and security.""

Afghanistan signed a cooperation pact with Iran in August covering mainly security issues, but Faizi said the proposed new agreement would have a broader scope.

Rouhani said Sunday his country opposes the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan and the region, saying their presence generates tension, the official IRNA news agency reported.

IRNA quoted Rouhani as telling Karzai: ""We believe that all foreign forces should leave the region and that the security of Afghanistan should be handed over to people of the country.""

""We are concerned about tensions caused by foreign forces' presence in the region,"" Rouhani was quoted as saying. He also called for more cooperation between Tehran and Kabul.

Iran has long opposed a planned agreement to allow U.S. forces to remain stationed on its doorstep in neighboring Afghanistan. The two countries have about 580 miles of common borders.

Rouhani also said Iran opposes any foreign forces in the region, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet has a base in the tiny kingdom of Bahrain.

On Saturday, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel laid out steps to beef up defense cooperation between states within the Gulf region, while at the same time insisting that America's military commitment to the Middle East will continue.

In a speech Saturday to Gulf leaders he also made it clear that the emerging global agreement that would limit Iran's nuclear program doesn't mean the security threat from the Islamic republic is over.

Iran's Defense Minister Gen. Hosein Dehghan called the remarks by his American counterpart ""threatening"" on Sunday, adding that they pave the ground for mistrust toward the U.S. while revealing the influence of Israel -- Iran's arch enemy -- on Washington.

Iran believes that countries of the Gulf are capable of managing security through regional security pacts.

Iran signed an interim agreement over its nuclear plan with world powers last month. Rouhani has been trying to convince skeptics and hard-liners at home that the move was not compromising on key issues of national sovereignty.

Israel has repeatedly criticized the deal and called it a ""historic mistake,"" saying economic sanctions must be toughened, not eased.
