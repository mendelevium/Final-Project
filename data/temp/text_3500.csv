States struggling to make ends meet during the recent recession cut more than $4 billion from their mental-health budgets from 2009 through 2012.

Now with the one-year anniversary of the Dec. 14, 2012, Sandy Hook elementary school shootings just days away, a new report shows at least 37 states have increased spending on mental health programs.

Texas lawmakers appear to have approved the biggest increase -- $259 million more in their newest two-year budget, the largest such increase in state history, according the National Alliance on Mental Health.

“With few exceptions, state legislatures acknowledged the need [to] increase or maintain mental-health appropriations or enact legislation,” the group said in its 2013 State Legislation Report.

Many of the increases are related to efforts to comply with mental-health provisions in ObamaCare that start next year. And much of the legislation enacted this year was to expand the state-federal Medicaid program under the law because it is essential in paying and providing coverage for the estimated 2.7 million uninsured Americans affected by mental illness, the report states.

Oregon, for example, increased its 2014-15 budget by roughly 22 percent to comply with the president’s signature health care law.

The group argues that timing also played a factor in the increases, particularly the White House’s response to the Sandy Hook shootings -- in which 20 students and six adults were fatally shot. And that the mass shooting happened right before state legislative sessions started.

The White House called for widespread changes including tighter school security and increased background checks on gun buyers. However, the NAMI argued the vast majority of people with mental illness is “no more violent than the general population” and called for providers of mental-health care to do a better job of complying with exist standards when reporting dangerous behavior related to gun ownership.

The report points out that mental-health advocates warned that the “avalanche” of state legislation could result in Americans not seeking mental-health care and that changes could threaten civil liberties.

Among the changes cited was the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, one of the first bills enacted in 2013 that increased the responsibilities of providers to turn over mental health records as related to gun sales. Similar SAFE acts were enacted in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut and Tennessee.

The report also points out Alaska and North Carolina reduced their mental health budgets.

The Obama administration last month announced the final executive order of 23 that the president signed in January, while Congress has not come through in efforts to keep guns out the hands of people who are mentally ill and dangerous.

One change is mental health patients can now get immediate emergency room care, like somebody with a broken bone, without having to get pre-approval from their insurance company.

""Imagine what it would mean if people felt as comfortable saying they were going for counseling as they do saying they're going for a flu shot or physical therapy,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in announcing the change.

Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said before the president signed the executive orders that he didn’t know whether an assault weapons ban could pass the Senate but thought a bill to improved background checks and related ones could pass.

""There are some who say nothing will pass,” he said. “I disagree with that. What I'm interested in is what we can get."""
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/focus-on-mental-health-laws-to-curb-violence-is-unfair-some-say.html,2013-02-01 00:00:00,"['Erica Goode', 'Jack Healy']","Focus on Mental Health Laws to Curb Violence Is Unfair, Some Say","“The devil is in the details,” he said of New York’s new law. “The two fears are that people will be deterred from seeking treatment that they need or that, once they are in treatment, they will clam up and not talk about violence.”

Most mental health experts agree that the link between mental illness and violence is not imaginary. Studies suggest that people with an untreated severe mental illness are more likely to be violent, especially when drug or alcohol abuse is involved. And many rampage killers have some type of serious mental disorder: James E. Holmes, accused of opening fire in a movie theater in Colorado in July, was seeing a psychiatrist who became alarmed about his behavior; Jared L. Loughner, who killed 6 people and injured 13 others in Arizona, including former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, was severely mentally ill.

But such killings account for only a tiny fraction of gun homicides in the United States, mental health experts point out. Besides the research indicating that little violent crime can be linked to perpetrators who are mentally ill, studies show that those crimes are far more likely to involve battery — punching another person, for example — than weapons, which account for only 2 percent of violent crimes committed by the mentally ill.

Because of this, some criminal justice experts say it makes more sense to pass laws addressing behavior, rather than a diagnosis of mental illness. In Indiana, for example, firearms can be confiscated from people deemed a potential threat, whether or not they have a mental illness.

Proposals in a number of states seek to redefine the threshold for involuntary commitment to psychiatric treatment. But in doing so, they have reignited a longstanding debate about the role of forced treatment.

In Ohio, lawmakers are expected to consider a proposal to increase access to outpatient commitment instead of hospitalization, while also doing away with language requiring people with mental illness to show a “grave and imminent risk to substantial rights” of themselves or others before they can be committed.

In Colorado, where legislators are undertaking a broad overhaul of the state’s mental health system proposed by Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, the proposal also includes changing the criteria for involuntary commitment."

Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed the options in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich. The letter was sent as, on the other side of the Hill, the House Intelligence Committee signed off on the administration's call to arm the Syria opposition -- though the committee, which held that up for weeks, continued to voice reservations.

Dempsey's letter, released Monday, went far beyond arming the opposition in outlining potential options. He sent the letter after taking heat at last week's confirmation hearing from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who pressed Dempsey for his advice on Syria while suggesting the administration had not done enough -- McCain threatened to place a hold on Dempsey's nomination until he got answers.

In the letter, Dempsey gave five options on Syria beyond providing humanitarian assistance, which the U.S. already is doing.

At the least invasive end, he said, is the option of training, advising and assisting the rebels. The next level up would be conducting limited strikes on ""high-value regime"" military targets.

The three other options are increasingly costly and risky.

They include:

A no-fly zone, which according to Dempsey could cost up to a billion dollars per month and would include shooting down regime aircraft and conducting strikes on their airfields.

The establishment of ""buffer zones,"" which would be ""specific geographic areas"" where the opposition would safely organize and train. This would require thousands of U.S. ground forces, Dempsey said, ""even if positioned outside Syria,"" to protect these zones.

A campaign to secure chemical weapons. This would entail destroying portions of Syria's stockpile, interdicting shipments and seizing other components. At minimum, Dempsey said, this would include a no-fly zone and thousands of special operations and other forces to secure critical sites.

Dempsey stressed that these are just options that have been prepared, and that some options ""may not be feasible in time or cost.""

On another front, the House Intelligence Committee gave tentative approval toward arming the opposition.

Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said that despite ""very strong concerns about the strength of the administration's plans in Syria and its chances for success"" there was ""consensus that we could move forward with what the administration's plans and intentions are in Syria consistent with committee reservations.""

The Intelligence Committee had delayed the administration for weeks from fully implementing its Syria policy, including arming the rebels, Fox News has learned.

Fox also confirmed that a majority -- but not all -- of the Committee members signed off on moving forward with the plan.

House Speaker John Boehner, addressing the Syria crisis on Tuesday, said helping ""the right set of rebels is in our nation's best interest.""

It was not immediately clear how the new policy would be funded although money could be ""reprogrammed"" from other accounts, including possibly the defense spending bill.

Story highlights The party reportedly has three ministers and two secretaries of state The officials will ""continue to shoulder their responsibilities,"" a party leader says Tunisia faces political unrest after a rare political assassination

Members of the president’s party in Tunisia will quit the coalition government, the state-run news agency TAP reported Sunday.

The move threatens to worsen a political crisis, set off after an opposition leader was assassinated there last week.

The Congress for the Republic Party, which counts Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki among its ranks, has three ministers and two secretaries of state in the government, TAP reported.

The five officials will “continue to shoulder their responsibilities within their respective departments to avoid any administrative vacuum,” TAP said, citing Chokri Yacoub, a party leader.

The news comes one day after Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali said he would step down if a caretaker government he is forming fails to win approval from Tunisia’s National Constituent Assembly.

In response to the shooting death of Chokri Belaid, Jebali sacked his government and said he would appoint a new one to serve until the next election.

However, a top official of Jebali’s own Ennahda party labeled Jebali’s moves “non-binding,” raising questions about his leadership.

Belaid, a prominent secular politician who decried violence, was shot dead as he left his home Wednesday morning for work. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Belaid’s widow and others blamed the climate fostered by Jebali’s Ennahda party.

Jebali denied that Ennahda had anything do with Belaid’s killing and said he hoped to get approval for his new government from his party and others.

“The government, I feel, is backed by a lot of people, mainly among ordinary people. I hope that political parties will translate the view of our people,” Jebali said Friday.

As he spoke, thousands of Tunisians demonstrated in the streets of the capital in outrage over the assassination, calling on Jebali to resign.

The killing of Belaid was the country’s first high-profile political assassination since Tunisia’s “Jasmine Revolution” that toppled President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali two years ago and spawned the Arab Spring.

(CNN) —

Two U.S. embassy officials were wounded Tuesday in a shooting, apparently at a strip club, in Caracas, Venezuela.

The U.S. State Department said two members of the embassy suffered non-life-threatening injuries but did not provide details.

The shooting occurred at the Antonella 2012 club, said Miroslava Gomez, a police spokeswoman.

Police and investigators combed the club, in the basement of a mall, but did not speak to reporters outside on Tuesday.

Mall security said the establishment is a strip club.

Signs posted outside the door of the club described it as a “weapon-free zone” and said the entrance of couples, unaccompanied women or anyone under 30 is forbidden.

Images of scantily clad women dancing around poles were plastered on a wall just inside the club’s entrance.

The club’s manager said on Tuesday night that the shooting had occurred inside the establishment.

The injured U.S. officials worked with the embassy’s defense liaison office, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

The two injured embassy officials were shot at a club in northeast Caracas, said an attending physician at a hospital in the Venezuelan capital. One was shot in the abdomen and the leg, and the other in the abdomen, Dr. Carlos Pacheco said.

The State Department did not immediately release the names of the two injured officials.

State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell would not elaborate on what kind of establishment the officials were at, except to say it was “some sort of social spot.”

Asked Tuesday afternoon whether the shooting had occurred at a strip club, Ventrell told reporters, “I have no information on the site whatsoever.”

The department was not aware of any arrests, Ventrell said, but it is in contact with local authorities.

Embassy security and health unit personnel were at the hospital and have reached out to the officials’ families, Ventrell said.

Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, began an old-school, speak-until-you-can-speak-no-more filibuster on Wednesday just before noon, and was still going strong hours later.

Mr. Paul, who opposes the nomination of John O. Brennan to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, had previously said he would filibuster President Obama’s nominee after receiving a letter this month from Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. that refused to rule out the use of drone strikes within the United States in “extraordinary circumstances” like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

On Wednesday, Mr. Paul did exactly as promised, taking to the Senate floor to filibuster Mr. Brennan’s nomination.

“I rise today to begin to filibuster John Brennan’s nomination for the C.I.A.,” Mr. Paul began. “I will speak until I can no longer speak. I will speak as long as it takes, until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our Constitution is important, that your rights to trial by jury are precious, that no American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court.”



Mr. Paul is the first senator to use an actual filibuster after the Senate reached a deal earlier this year to take some basic steps to limit the filibuster.

As Mr. Paul’s filibuster — quickly nicknamed the “filiblizzard” by Twitter users, poking fun at the Washington snow storm that failed to materialize — entered its fourth hour, the senator from Kentucky got an assist from his friends, as Senators Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, joined him on the Senate floor to help with the effort.

Mr. Paul did not yield the floor — a move that would effectively end his filibuster — but he did, with some apparent relief, yield to take questions from his Republican colleagues.

Mr. Cruz began by making the obvious allusion, referring to Mr. Paul as a “modern day ‘Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,’ ” joking that his effort would “surely be making Jimmy Stewart smile.”

And, perhaps befitting of public stands, Mr. Cruz also took the opportunity to remind the chamber that Wednesday marks the 177th anniversary of the fall of the Alamo, noting with some pride that Mr. Paul “is originally from the great state of Texas.”

Mr. Cruz then proceeded to read from a letter written by William Barrett Travis, a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army who died at the Alamo, concluding, “Does that glorious letter give you any encouragement and sustenance on this 177th anniversary of the Alamo?”

Apparently it did, as Mr. Paul soldiered ahead, before again receiving some help, this time from an unlikely source — Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.

Mr. Wyden said that while he had voted in favor of Mr. Brennan’s nomination at Tuesday’s Senate Intelligence Committee meeting and plans to vote for him again on the Senate floor, he believed that Mr. Paul “has made a number of important points” about the administration’s lethal drone program and the potential for targeting American citizens on United States soil.

“I think Senator Paul and I agree that this nomination also provides a very important opportunity for the United States Senate to consider the government’s rules and policies on the targeted killings of Americans and that, of course, has been a central pillar of our nation’s counterterror strategy,” Mr. Wyden said.

He added that he felt that “the executive branch should not be allowed to conduct such a serious and far-reaching program by themselves without any scrutiny, because that’s not how American democracy works.”

And then, as the (now bipartisan) filibuster began to feel a bit like a Shakespearean drama, none other than Senator Marco Rubio of Florida entered from stage right, complete with a water joke — a reference to his recent State of the Union response, in which a video of a parched Mr. Rubio chugging water quickly went viral.

“You’ve been here for a while, so let me give you some advice,” Mr. Rubio. “Keep some water nearby. Trust me.”"

Pollak'],"Yesterday, Obama Was Not My President–or Yours","On Monday, while the death toll mounted at the Navy Yard, President Barack Obama delivered a strident partisan tirade against Republicans, using the fifth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse to score political points ahead of the debt ceiling debate. It was an appalling act of division and insensitivity, and unlike George W. Bush’s My Pet Goat moment on 9/11, it was a calculated abdication of leadership.

It was also an act that places Obama’s passivity during the Benghazi attacks–and his decision to fly to Las Vegas the next day for a campaign fundraiser–in perspective. This is a president who, even as Navy Seals approached Osama bin Laden’s hideout, retired to play cards with his pals. The image is of a man with little regard for the lives of Americans in “his” military, or their families, beyond their use as campaign props.

In addition, President Obama–like it or not–leads the entire nation, not just the majority that voted him into office. In moments of terror and tragedy, his job is to bring the American people together, not to split us apart. Conservatives have been willing–eager, even–to embrace Obama on such occasions, as many did after his speech at the memorial for the Tuscon victims in 2011. Yesterday, he foreclosed any such reconciliation.

What we are seeing is partly the result of Obama’s political foundation as a community organizer–there is never a crisis to waste, so to speak, in stirring up your core supporters against their contrived opponents. But even Alinsky, who had enough sense to criticize those who called police “pigs,” would have counseled against Obama’s speech yesterday, which could not have brought more benefit than harm to his cause.

Yes, Obama did begin by acknowledging the Navy Yard attacks. That is, at least, an improvement from how he reacted to the Ford Hood shooting in 2009, which he only mentioned after several “shout-outs” to his supporters in the audience.

Yet the speech itself should have been canceled, or postponed. The fact that the White House never even considered that option shows how out of touch Obama is with his basic duties.

A story comes to mind, told by a friend in Chicago who met Obama during his obscure State Senate years. Obama was at a local function for medical professionals, and my friend, having just met the Senator from Hyde Park, tried to introduce him to a friend from the same neighborhood. In the nervous rush of the moment, he forgot that friend’s name. “Well, I guess he isn’t your friend, is he,” Obama deadpanned.

Obama then presented his business card, said, “You’ll be hearing about me,” turned, and left, leaving the two men in shock at his rudeness.

That’s the real Obama–the one slowly emerging in presidential biographies now that he is safely ensconced in a second term, the one who drops even the most loyal aides when he feels they are no longer of use to him, the man capable of relating to large crowds but not concrete human beings.

Speaker of the House John Boehner said that Obama’s speech was a “shame.” Charles Krauthammer said that it was in “extremely bad taste.” It was worse than that. It was an insult to the victims and their families, a slap in the face to the nation as a whole, a dereliction of the simplest duty of empathy and discretion. He may apologize–he ought to–but what Obama revealed about himself in that moment can never be undone."

At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has said it wants to buy more than 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition in the next four or five years -- which could put further strain on the supply.

The shortage, coupled with an increase in prices, comes as many gun owners head to the stores in anticipation of new gun control laws. States like Colorado and New York have already approved such legislation, while Democrats move toward bringing a bill to the Senate floor. At the moment, the congressional bill does not include an assault-weapons ban, but a ban is expected to be floated as an amendment.

Still, what one official described as ""panic-buying"" set in, as lawmakers rallied to draft new legislation in the wake of a series of tragic mass shootings last year, from Aurora, Colo., to Oak Creek, Wis., to Newtown, Conn.

In Tennessee's Hamilton County, the sheriff's department says its officers will be given fewer bullets when they train at the range.

""The concern over firearms availability and ammunition availability and potentials of gun control certainly has impacted the availability of ammunition purchased locally,"" training coordinator Jody Mays said, according to WDEF.

Earlier this year, Rollingwood Police Chief Dayne Pryor told MyFoxAustin.com that ""panic-buying"" is contributing to a situation where officers trying to order new firearms are being forced to wait. He said the city, which is outside Austin, has been told to expect wait times to purchase AR-15s and ammunition.

""We have adequate supplies right now, but we're limited to how often we can go to the firing range to train because we want to be conservative right now,"" he said.

Similarly, the Jenks Police Department in Oklahoma has faced rising ammo and assault weapons costs.

Police Chief Cameron Arthur said the department is still waiting on an order from October, according to KJRH.

Meanwhile, according to CNSNews.com, Rep. Timothy Huelskamp, R-Kan., said he still hasn't heard back from the Department of Homeland Security on why it's buying 1.6 billion rounds.

The Homeland Security Department, though, has said it needs the bullets for law enforcement agents in training and on duty.

Published federal notices about the ammo buy have agitated conspiracy theorists since the fall. The government's explanation is much less sinister.

The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., and others like it run by DHS use up to 15 million rounds a year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.

More than 90 federal agencies and 70,000 agents and officers used the department's training center last year.

The rest of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition would be purchased by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government's second largest criminal investigative agency.

The Homeland Security ammo buy is not the first time the government's bullets purchases have sparked concerns on the Internet. The same thing happened last year when the Social Security Administration posted a notice that it was buying 174,000 hollow point bullets.

The FAA released a statement in response to questions about an ordinance under consideration in the tiny farming community of Deer Trail, Colo., that would encourage hunters to shoot down drowns. The administration reminded the public that it regulates the nation's airspace, including the airspace over cities and towns.

""I want to take a stand against the coming surveillance society that seems to be rushing in on us,"" Phillip Steel, a resident in town who drafted the ordinance and submitted it for approval by the town board, told ""Fox and Friends.""

Officials in the town admit they have never seen a drone plane on the Eastern Plains, but they want to make a statement that they think using unmanned surveillance planes to spy on people in the United States is wrong. They say the ordinance is mostly symbolic. They also recognize it's against federal law to destroy federal property.

The FAA for its part said a drone ""hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air. Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil liability, just as would firing at a manned airplane.""

Under the proposed ordinance, Deer Trail would grant hunting permits to shoot drones. The permits would cost $25 each. The town would also encourage drone hunting by awarding $100 to anyone who presents a valid hunting license and identifiable pieces of a drone that has been shot down.

AIR FORCE DRONE CRASHES, CLOSES FLORIDA ROAD

Steel, 48, said in an interview that he has 28 signatures on a petition — roughly 10 percent of the town's registered voters. Under Colorado law, that requires local officials to formally consider the proposal at a meeting next month. Town officials would then have the option of adopting the ordinance or putting it on the ballot in an election this fall, he said.

The proposed ordinance is mostly a symbolic protest against small, civilian drones that are coming into use in the United States, Steel said. He acknowledged that it's unlikely there are any drones in use near Deer Trail.

The head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation acknowledged in June that his agency uses drones to conduct surveillance in the United States, but said they do so rarely, The Wall Street Journal reported . FBI director Robert Mueller said the agency uses them ""in a very, very minimal way, very seldom.""

Federal agencies have been using drones for years to monitor the northern and southern borders of the U.S., and those drones have occasionally been deployed to help domestic law-enforcement agencies like the FBI."

He said few will ever forget the end of the marathon manhunt in Watertown, Mass. Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gunbattle with police, and residents cheered and gave police high fives after his brother Dzhokhar was apprehended.

""But they're out there — hundreds of thousands of you patrolling our streets every single day. And we know that when we need you most, you'll be ready to dash into danger, to protect our lives, even if it means putting your lives on the line.""

Obama was flanked by award recipients, many in uniform, with families, friends and other officers looking on from the audience in the East Room.

The annual ceremony honored 43 law enforcement officers who are recipients of the National Association of Police Organizations TOP COPS award.

The group included eight officers from the Oak Creek, Wis., police force who battled a gunman at a Sikh temple last Aug. 5. The gunman killed six people before turning his weapon on himself. Obama singled out Brian Murphy, the first to arrive, who, he said, suffered 12 bullet wounds.

He also singled out New York police Detective Ivan Marcano, who was off duty in the Bronx with his girlfriend when he saw muggers attack a cab driver. Obama recounted Marcano being shot inches from his heart yet still giving chase to the suspects — holding his wound with one hand and his weapon with the other. Obama had Marcano's girlfriend stand, saying, ""This was his date night! It's unbelievable.""

Story continues

Other honorees included officers from California, Illinois, Iowa, Florida, Indiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Wisconsin, as well as three FBI agents from Nevada.

""They'll tell you they're not heroes. They'll say they were just doing their jobs,"" Obama said. ""Today we honor them as TOP COPS because they're half right.""

He said they signed up knowing ""they might be called upon to do some really tough stuff. But I think that makes them more heroic, not less heroic.""

Obama added America owes police officers all the support it can give — including the resources and equipment to do their work. He said that includes enough money to prevent layoffs and what he termed ""common sense"" gun measures.

Obama's efforts to enact tighter background checks for gun purchases following last December's Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting have so far failed to make headway in the Senate.

""Let's hit these office phone lines, twitter accounts, and Facebook pages hard today, and instead of pro amnesty supporters, let the Americans speak against amnesty on 9/11!"" reads the email, signed by the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC President William Gheen and posted to its website.

""The illegals are trying to hijack the cockpit of America's government!"" the email continues. ""Let's roll!""

Immigration reform opponents often invoke the 9/11 attacks to help make their arguments, pointing to the undocumented status of some of the hijackers who overstayed their visas.

ALIPAC was founded on 9/11 nine years ago, according to its email, ""in honor of the victims of the terror attacks that occurred because our government failed at its most basic responsibility to protect our citizens from those who would enter our nation to do us harm.""

The email seems to imply that other undocumented immigrants are, at least metaphorically, in a similar position of trying to harm the United States. It called on recipients to contact members of the House of Representatives who might support reform and urge them to vote against it.

Members of the ""gang of eight,"" a bipartisan group that drafted a reform bill passed by the Senate in June, argued that their legislation would aid the government's efforts to detect people who overstayed their visas by requiring airports to track both entries and exits to the United States.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the gang of eight, said after the bombings in Boston earlier this year that such attacks only showed the importance of immigration reform.

""It’s a compelling argument for better identifying people who leave and enter this country,"" McCain said in April. ""I think that the whole system of better border enforcement, e-verify system, better help us account for people in this country and their activities."""

%22He was completely normal%22

Students in Tsarnaev%27s dorm say the alleged bomber did not appear radical

Bomb suspect described as likeable%2C friendly%2C often high on pot

DARTMOUTH, Mass. -- Friends and classmates of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can't grasp how the pot-smoking, party boy they knew is the same young man now accused of carrying out a terrorist attack.

Tsarnaev was funny, sarcastic, liked to party and frequently reeked of marijuana, said students in a sophomore residence at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth where the alleged bomber lived.

Several students on Tuesday described a shared shock and disbelief as classmates discovered that Tsarnaev faces federal charges of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.

""It's like finding out your best friend is a serial killer,"" said Jennifer Mendez, who met Tsarnaev last year in their freshmen dorm. ""He was really social and hilarious. He was one of those people who would crack one joke and make your night.""

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, carried out two explosions that rocked the Boston Marathon on April 15, federal officials say. The bombs left three people dead and more than 260 others injured.

Last Thursday, the two allegedly gunned down Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier as they were being sought by authorities. The older brother was killed in a confrontation with police early Friday morning. The younger Tsarnaev brother now faces criminal charges that carry a possible death sentence.

Mendez, 20, grew close with Dzhokar Tsarnaev. Both moved into Pine Dale Hall to start their sophomore year.

On Sunday, the FBI searched Tsarnaev's dorm room in that building and seized BBs, a large pyrotechnic, and ""a black jacket and a white hat of the same general appearance as those worn by Bomber Two at the Boston marathon on April 15,"" according to the criminal complaint filed against Tsarnaev.

Mendez can't imagine the motives behind Tsarnaev's alleged actions. Like many in Pine Dale Hall, she didn't connect the blurry picture of Suspect Two to their classmate.

In the years she knew him, Mendez said Tsarnaev just enjoyed playing soccer, talked about his years wrestling and mulled over the demands of college life: professors, classes, and homework. Partying and drinking filled their days, she said, and Tsarnaev did not show signs he was becoming radical or changing in any way.

Her best memories are of the two sitting outside Maple Ridge Hall, the freshman dorm they shared, talking about school and the excitement of being in college.

Mendez, a biology and chemistry double major, last partied with Tsarnaev last semester. The demands of her studies slowed her partying down this semester, but Tsarnaev seemed normal when she sat in politics class with him or when she passed him on the way to his third-floor dorm.

Tsarnaev shared that third-floor dorm room with another student, said Patrick Yaghoobian, 20, who lived next -door to the pair all school year.

""He smoked a lot of pot,"" he said of Tsarnaev on Tuesday afternoon. ""He smelled like it every day.""

A strong smell of marijuana emanated from the room throughout the school year while Tsarnaev, himself, reeked of the drug, Yaghoobian said. The smell was absent last Monday when the bombing took place.

He said Tsarnaev was a quiet kid who walked around with the same blank, emotionless expression seen in many of the photos released by the FBI.

The Millbury, Mass., native added that there were no signs of radicalism: ""I've looked into his room a few times, and there was nothing religious or nothing that screamed out he was Muslim."""

“Terror is up worldwide,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “The statistics indicate that. The fatalities are way up.”

Feinstein made her comments on CNN’s “State of the Union” during a joint interview with Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, who argued the terror group Al Qaeda continues to grow and consolidate.

“What's happening in places like Syria [is] that you have a pooling of Al Qaeda and affiliates. … Groups have changed the way they communicate, which means it's less likely that we're going to be able to detect something prior to an event.”

Rogers also suggested that public scrutiny over U.S. intelligence work, brought on by recent disclosures about the efforts of the National Security Agency and others, has hurt anti-terror efforts.

“We’re fighting amongst ourselves here in this country about the role of our intelligence community,” he said. “That is having an impact on our ability to stop what is a growing number of threats. Our intelligence community isn’t the bad guys.”

Rogers also said terrorists are adopting the idea that ""maybe smaller events are OK"" and still might achieve their goals.

""That makes it exponentially harder for our intelligence services to stop an event like that from happening,"" he said.

Feinstein attributed the growing threat in part to improved weaponry.

""There are new bombs, very big bombs, trucks being reinforced for those bombs,"" she said.

Though neither lawmaker offered specifics about what led them to their conclusions, Feinstein spoke generally of ""a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist jihadist Islamic community, and that is that the West is responsible for everything that goes wrong and that the only thing that's going to solve this is Islamic Shariah law and the concept of the caliphate.""

The caliphate is an Islamic state led by a religious and political leader, or caliph, considered a successor of the Prophet Muhammad and who governs by Shariah law.

(CNN) —

The picture emerging of the dead gunman in Monday’s rampage at the Washington Navy Yard is a study in contrasts, one of a man who practiced languages and meditated, and another of a cold-blooded killer.

The gunman was identified as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist and a current military contractor, the Washington FBI Field Office told CNN. His identity was confirmed by fingerprints and a picture ID card, the FBI said.

Authorities have not released a possible motive in the morning shooting at the headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command that left 12 people – and the gunman – dead. But a friend said Alexis was locked in a dispute over money with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy.

Investigators also learned that Alexis had recently made contact with two Veterans Affairs hospitals for apparent psychological issues, law enforcement sources told CNN on Tuesday. However, other sources said Alexis sought help from the VA for sleep-related issues.

Authorities said earlier that they are confident that Alexis was the lone gunman, after a daylong police search for a possible second suspect.

Gaining access

Alexis was carrying a military-contractor ID that matched his appearance, a D.C. Metropolitan Police official told CNN on condition of anonymity.

Alexis used that ID to gain access to the Navy Yard, according to a U.S. law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation.

He drove onto the installation and parked before walking a short distance to Building 197. Once inside, according to the official, Alexis made his way to an overlook above the atrium and opened fire into the cafeteria.

What is security like at Washington Navy Yard?

Initial reports said Alexis used an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle during the attack, but by Tuesday, law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation said that was not the case.

It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday’s shooting, the officials said. Investigators have recovered three weapons from the scene, including a shotgun that Alexis is believed to have brought into the compound. The other two weapons – handguns – the sources say, may have been taken from guards.

While the FBI was urging anyone with information about Alexis to come forward, investigators were focusing on reported incidents, including police run-ins, that portray a man with increasingly violent tendencies.

Employment

Alexis was believed to have arrived in the Washington area last week, when he reportedly checked into a hotel, according to someone who met him at the hotel. The person, who declined to be identified, said Alexis indicated that he planned to be in the area for several weeks.

Who are the victims?

At the time of the shooting, Alexis was working for The Experts, a subcontractor of HP Enterprise Services that was contracted to “refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network,” according to a statement released by the company.

Alexis, who had Department of Defense security clearance, worked from September 2012 through January refreshing computer systems in Japan, said Thomas E. Hoshko, the CEO of The Experts.

His security clearance was renewed in July to carry out the same type of contract work at the Navy Yard, Hoshko said.

Alexis returned to work with The Experts that same month, he said. He worked at facilities in Rhode Island, North Carolina and Virginia for weeks at a time upgrading computer systems, Hoshko said.

No one reported having any problems with him during those assignments, the chief executive said.

Alexis began working at the Navy Yard last week, though it was unclear whether he had actually begun working or was still securing his base clearance, Hoshko said.

Many surprised

There were no indications that Alexis had any ideological differences with the Navy or any disagreements with anyone at the Navy Yard, the U.S. law enforcement official said.

Alexis’ family reeled at the news that he was believed to be the man behind the killings.

“What I do know is he wasn’t that type of person,” Anthony Little, who identified himself as Alexis’ brother-in-law, told reporters outside his home in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. “I didn’t really hear anything that would make me feel, as a newcomer to the family, that somebody should be watching him.”

He said the family’s initial reaction was “very distraught, very stressed out, tears.”

“You know, they didn’t see it coming,” said Little, who is married to Alexis’ sister Naomi. “Their hearts are going out more to the victims and the people that got hurt because, you know, there’s more lives lost and we don’t need that right now. We really don’t.”

Opinion: What could have prevented Navy Yard carnage?

Navy reservist

Alexis, who was from New York City, served as a full-time Navy reservist between 2007 and 2011, according to military records.

In the Navy, he achieved the rank of aviation electrician’s mate 3rd class, working on aircraft electrical systems, the records show.

Alexis was honorably discharged after a “pattern of misconduct,” a U.S. defense official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official did not detail the misconduct.

Most recently, Alexis worked as an information technology contractor with the Navy, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.

Legal run-ins

Alexis appeared to have had sporadic run-ins with the law, dating back to at least 2004 when he was arrested in Seattle, accused of shooting out the tires of a man’s truck in an anger-fueled “blackout,” according to a Seattle Police Department report.

He told investigators he believed the man, a construction worker, was mocking him, but had no memory of shooting out the tires, the report said.

Investigators later spoke with Alexis’ father, who told police that his son had anger management problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, which he suffered after working “as an active participant in rescue attempts” during the 9/11 attacks, the report said.

Alexis was arrested in August 2008 on a charge of disorderly conduct in DeKalb County, Georgia, county police said Tuesday.

And in 2010, Alexis was arrested by Fort Worth, Texas, police but never charged over an allegation that he fired a gun through the ceiling of his apartment. According to records, he told police he accidentally fired it while cleaning it.

Witness: “He aimed his gun at us”

Good friends

His last known address was outside of Fort Worth, where he was roommates for three years with Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who described Alexis as his best friend.

Alexis befriended Suthamtewakul four years ago after he emigrated from Thailand.

Alexis taught him about American culture, Suthamtewakul told CNN. Alexis, he said, was fluent in Thai and attended a Buddhist temple.

When Suthamtewakul opened the Happy Bowl Thai Restaurant, Alexis would occasionally help out, waiting tables, he said.

The two were roommates until five months ago, when Suthamtewakul got married and Alexis had to move out.

Toward the end, Alexis spent a lot of time holed up in his room, keeping to himself, Suthamtewakul said.

On Monday, Suthamtewakul was stunned by the news that Alexis was said to be the shooter in the rampage at the Navy Yard.

“I can’t believe he did this,” he said. “He never showed any sign of violence.”

Frustrations

But there were signs that Alexis was unhappy.

He was having a hard time trying to get on his feet, said Suthamtewakul’s wife, Kristi. He helped out at the restaurant but not for pay.

“He was using this as an educational experience to help learn Thai,” she said. He enjoyed making deliveries to homes, where the language was spoken. He talked about moving to Thailand.

But to Suthamtewakul, Alexis seemed “frustrated with life.”

She is grieving. “He was like one of our best friends, like a brother to us and always willing to go out of his way to help us out with things,” she said.

He was very frustrated with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy, according to another friend.

Alexis claimed he wasn’t paid properly by the company after returning from a months-long assignment to Japan last year, said Michael Ritrovato, another former roommate.

It was unclear whether the dispute was over salary or expenses. Alexis just felt the company owed him money and had not paid him, Ritrovato said.

Gun knowledge

He is in shock over his friend’s actions.

“He was an easygoing guy. I don’t know of any reason for this,” he said.

But Ritrovato knew Alexis was fascinated by guns. “He was … knowledgeable with military rifles and handguns. At least he led us to believe he was. But nobody ever had the idea that he would use them in a derogatory way,” he said.

It is not clear whether Alexis was still living in Fort Worth area at the time of the shooting.

While Americans wondered if it was a terrorist attack or if there were multiple shooters still on the loose, their president touted again his re-election victory of last year, scoffing at his long-vanquished opponent’s effort to make the election a referendum on Obama’s 2010 health law.

The president certainly knew the shooting was taking place and that the manhunt was underway, referencing both in introductory remarks before going into his standard stump speech assailing Republicans in the ongoing budget battle, now in its third year. It had been more three hours since the news broke.

Critics have complained before about the president’s bad timing: Heading to Las Vegas for a fundraiser while the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya was still smoldering; hitting the golf course with ESPN hosts in the midst of the Syria crisis; etc.

But those complaints can at least be partly answered by the fact that the president is the president all of the time. Just as Democrats complained about George W. Bush’s frequent decampments to his Texas ranch, Republicans fume over Obama’s relentless fundraising and golf obsession. But history tells us that it is more about what a president does than where he does it.

Obama did not order a military intervention after the Libya attack. Would his critics have thought his inaction better if he would have been sitting in the Oval Office instead of aboard Air Force One? Unlikely. Would Obama’s backing off on Syria been more palatable if he had not been playing golf with Tony Kornheiser? Doubt it.

But when the president chooses to address the public, timing matters. So why was his timing so terrible on Monday? Why did Obama feel the need to attack while thousands of Washington residents and workers were under “shelter in place” orders? What was it about this particular version of the same attack speech Obama has been giving since 2011 that could not wait?

Nothing. And that’s the point.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney scoffed at the question, saying cancelling the speech wasn’t even considered and that what Obama did was “entirely appropriate” because “time is short.”

It’s hard to imagine that time is so short until the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline that a day’s delay in the speech would have been so damaging, especially because it was so similar to dozens of other addresses the president has given. But in Obamaland, time is always short. In their relentless battle to own every news cycle and keep bulldozing the political press, every second counts.

The president has had an almost uniformly bad start to his second term. Scandals, the woe-begotten implementation of his health law, a chaotic unraveling of the once-vaunted “Arab Spring,” the ascendancy of rival nations on the world stage and the intractable partisan standoff in Congress have left Americans skeptical of Obama’s election-year plea to “hold on” just a bit longer to let his agenda work.

[pullquote]

In survival mode and stripped of the political stars who helped the administration stay on offense for the first four years, Team Obama is looking bereft. The result of the White House summit of former political aides who helped the president settle on trying to hang the Syria debacle around the necks of Congressional Republicans suggest that David Axelrod & Co. themselves have lost their chops whilst lolling in MSNBC green rooms and Hoovering up corporate cash on K Street.

The old approach of living life on terms set by Politico and TV news means attacking, attacking, attacking and attacking. If you want to “win the day,” you’ve got to be in the day. While the approach long ago turned Obama into wallpaper, ignored through overexposure, it did provide lots of fresh video and soundbites to make sure that the Washington press corps always had something fresh (or at least freshly recycled) from the administration.

This manic inability to pause or to even seemingly take a breath has policy consequences. It’s hard to imagine that Obama’s zig-zagging on Syria is influenced by anything so much as an allergy to even a half news cycle of unflattering headlines from a previously doting press. Bad polls, bad press? Must mean it’s bad policy.

But now the approach is even losing the support of those to whom Obama is catering. Politico itself today noted that Obama found “tone a challenge.” The same folks who thrilled to every fresh round of partisan bear baiting and nodded approvingly at a president whose political strategy was to explode his rivals now notes that it was unclear “what benefit the White House hoped to reap in launching a major fall offensive in the middle of a national and local tragedy that consumed media attention all day.”

The intended benefit was to keep reporters tap, tap, tapping away at their keyboards around Obama’s story line. Obama staged an entire barnstorming tour this summer that seemed substantially aimed at scolding reporters for focusing too much on his scandals and not enough on his call for more government spending, and yet you wonder why he plowed ahead with his debt-limit speech.

He was doing it for you, Politico. And this is how you repay him?

Obama seems desperately afraid to allow any news cycle to proceed without being in it somewhere. Whether it was talking to “The Pimp With the Limp” and other local deejays in 2012 or doing a Web interview this year with Zillow, Obama is always there, trying to bulldoze his way through the news cycle.

This time, since the story was in the press corps’ backyard, it became all too much. A president whose relentlessness was once considered his cardinal virtue as a subject (and, by extension, a leader) suddenly became distasteful.

Obama will make up for this by being more effusive in the aftermath of the shooting, rightly realizing he has some amends to make. But on Monday, we got a window of the mania that grips this second-term White House: the fear of being ignored.

Guy #1 is the sort I have been warning you about:

Police in Clarkstown, New York have confiscated a cache of high-powered weapons and body armor from a man who was arrested for posting death threats against against many Democratic politicians and every liberal supporter of President Barack Obama.

Mulqueen’s landlady had tipped off police after she found a “hit list” posted on Facebook that threatened Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY) and all members of the Congressional Black Caucus. *** Nyack-Piermont Patch reported that police searched Mulqueen’s home and found two high-powered rifles, two bayonets, a sword, a knuckle knife, body armor and ammunition. Included in the 100 rounds of ammunition were 27 so-called “tank buster” .50 caliber armor-piercing shells. Previous criminal convictions meant that it was illegal for Mulqueen to possess the weapons.

What did cops do to find this guy? They listened to his landlady when she complained after reading his facebook page.So this guy was not supposed to have guns of any sort to begin with and yet he has the audacity to post a hit list and threaten people.

The mind reels.

We'll never know if a tragedy was prevented or not: I see little harm in imagining this to be the case."

After Supreme Court ruling%2C Florida%2C Georgia%2C Mississippi and Texas set their own standards



Most likely%2C the case won%27t result in a dramatic shift in national criminal justice policy

Advocates want Supreme Court to revisit borderline cases

How should states decide if someone convicted of a crime has an intellectual disability, when the answer means life or death? This spring the Supreme Court will wade back into these murky waters, 12 years after it took the death penalty off the table for criminals with mental disabilities but left the details to the states.

In its 6-3 decision in Atkins v. Virginia, authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the court prohibited states from executing anyone with ""mental retardation."" Mental health professionals define it as substantial limitations in intellectual functions such as reasoning or problem-solving, limitations in adaptive behavior or ""street smarts,"" and evidence of the condition before age 18. (Mental retardation is the term used in law, but most clinicians and The Associated Press refer to the condition as intellectual disability.)

After the decision, most states stuck with the three-pronged clinical definition, but Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas set their own standards. Under Florida's law, if you have an IQ over 70, you're eligible for execution regardless of intellectual function or adaptive behavior.

Freddie Lee Hall, who has been on Florida's death row for more than 30 years and scored in the mid-70s on IQ tests, is arguing the state's standard amounts to unconstitutional punishment.

Most likely, the case won't result in a dramatic shift in national criminal justice policy, but will further clarify who should and should not be eligible for execution, said Ronald Tabak, an attorney who has represented multiple clients with intellectual disabilities and chairs the American Bar Association's death penalty committee.

""There is no reason to think that the court is taking this case because the court loves that Florida is going against the norms of the mental health field,"" Tabak said. ""The more likely reason they granted (judicial review) is …to say there are certain basic things about intellectual disability that you can't exclude from consideration.""

That's not the way Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi sees it. The Atkins decision, she wrote in her brief to the Supreme Court, ""expressly left the task of defining retardation to the states,"" and Florida is free to adopt its own standard for determining who is intellectually disabled.

""Freddie Lee Hall faces a death sentence for the 1978 murder of Karol Hurst, and Florida courts have found that he is not intellectually disabled,"" said Bondi. ""We will urge the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Hall's sentence.""

The court's makeup has shifted since the 2002 Atkins decision. But if the justices split along ideological lines, the vote could favor Hall, assuming that swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy sides with Hall, as he did with Atkins in 2002. Arguments are set for March 3.

Similar cases are percolating beyond Florida. In Georgia, death row inmate Warren Hill is fighting execution based on substantial evidence that he is intellectually disabled. In Texas, where the courts use an anecdotal seven-part test largely based on the characteristics of the fictional character Lennie from John Steinbeck's novel ""Of Mice and Men"" to determine intellectual disability, multiple prisoners have been executed in recent years even when they've scored well below 70 on IQ tests.

Last year, Texas executed Marvin Wilson, who was convicted of murder in 1994, even though he had an IQ of 61. In 2010, Virginia executed Teresa Lewis for her role in a murder-for-hire scheme, even though she had an IQ of 72 and her co-conspirators admitted Lewis did not plan the murder.

These are the types of cases advocates want the Supreme Court to revisit. ""It's our hope that the court will clarify that states must use the clinical definition for intellectual disability…not only for current cases but for future cases, too,"" said Margaret Nygren, executive director and CEO of the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.

BORDERLINE CASES

Freddie Lee Hall was convicted of co-planning and carrying out the murder of 21-year-old Karol Hurst in Leesburg, Fla., in 1978. After spending the day scouting the parking lot of a local grocery store with his partner, Mack Ruffin, Hall forced Hurst, who was seven months pregnant, into her car and drove her into the woods. There, Ruffin sexually assaulted and shot Hurst. A jury convicted Hall of first-degree murder for his role in the murder scheme.

Since Hall was sentenced to death in 1981, he has made multiple appeals based on his low IQ, which varied from 71 to 80 depending on the tests and their margins of error.

""He has been the same ever since I've known him, and he has the mind of a child,"" said his attorney, Eric Pinkard, who has been working with Hall since 1999.

In multiple hearings to prove his intellectual disability, Hall's family and longtime friends testified about Hall's struggles with reading, writing and caring for himself and recounted how Hall experienced abuse, starvation and torture as a child. The Florida courts decided that even though Hall had limits in functioning and adaptive behavior, because his IQ scores were not below 70, Hall was not intellectually disabled and could be executed.

It's these borderline cases where the individual state implementations matter, said Nygren. ""Intellectual disability, like genius, is on a continuum,"" Nygren said. ""It's challenging for states to legislate that this person is 'in' or 'out.'""

Still, the court shouldn't wade too much into the specifics of setting protocols to define intellectual disability, said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which advocates for victims of crime.

""If the Supreme Court gets into issues like these and declares them to be federal constitutional mandates,"" Scheidegger said, ""we will have a long stretch of litigation as the high court resolves one issue after another, never reaching the end.""

Making that determination is generally subject to clinical judgment, said Nygren. ""Clinicians must pick scientifically valid tests that are culturally relevant and standardized, but also individualized,"" Nygren said. ""For instance, if someone's been in jail for last five years, it's hard to evaluate if they're good at managing money since they don't have money to manage. That's where clinical judgment comes in.""

Beyond IQ tests, the disability manifests in limitations in learning and reasoning, and difficulty with social skills, personal care and language. These factors are just as relevant as an IQ test score, which, said Nygren, ""is never going to give you 100 percent (certainty), even though that's the expectation placed on the test.""

Advocates like Nygren want the court to require states to pay more attention to margins of error when determining intellectual disability. Leaving the determination of mental disability to the states, ""has given states a lot of leeway to do mischief with the definition of intellectual disability,"" said Brian Kammer, executive director of the Georgia Resource Center, which provides free legal services for death row inmates.

For instance, Georgia requires defendants to prove their intellectual disability ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the highest standard of proof in the criminal justice system. Georgia is the only state that requires such a high burden of proof and the legislature is considering lowering the standard in the next legislative session.

DEATH SENTENCES DOWN

Still, the Atkins decision has had an impact on executions. At least 98 people have had their death sentence changed since 2002 by proving that they were intellectually disabled, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center. By their count, in the 18 years before the Atkins decision, at least 44 people who likely suffered from intellectual disabilities were executed.

Nationally, states are carrying out fewer death sentences than they have since the penalty was reinstated in 1976. So far in 2013, 36 people have been executed in nine states. In 2012, 43 people were executed in nine states.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/17/what-is-obama-afraid/,2013-09-17 00:00:00,['Chris Stirewalt'],What is Obama afraid of?,"What mania could have compelled the president to take partisan swipes and accuse Republicans of being unpatriotic while police were in the middle of a manhunt after a mass shooting at a naval base just a few miles from the White House?

While Americans wondered if it was a terrorist attack or if there were multiple shooters still on the loose, their president touted again his re-election victory of last year, scoffing at his long-vanquished opponent’s effort to make the election a referendum on Obama’s 2010 health law.

The president certainly knew the shooting was taking place and that the manhunt was underway, referencing both in introductory remarks before going into his standard stump speech assailing Republicans in the ongoing budget battle, now in its third year. It had been more three hours since the news broke.

Critics have complained before about the president’s bad timing: Heading to Las Vegas for a fundraiser while the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya was still smoldering; hitting the golf course with ESPN hosts in the midst of the Syria crisis; etc.

But those complaints can at least be partly answered by the fact that the president is the president all of the time. Just as Democrats complained about George W. Bush’s frequent decampments to his Texas ranch, Republicans fume over Obama’s relentless fundraising and golf obsession. But history tells us that it is more about what a president does than where he does it.

Obama did not order a military intervention after the Libya attack. Would his critics have thought his inaction better if he would have been sitting in the Oval Office instead of aboard Air Force One? Unlikely. Would Obama’s backing off on Syria been more palatable if he had not been playing golf with Tony Kornheiser? Doubt it.

But when the president chooses to address the public, timing matters. So why was his timing so terrible on Monday? Why did Obama feel the need to attack while thousands of Washington residents and workers were under “shelter in place” orders? What was it about this particular version of the same attack speech Obama has been giving since 2011 that could not wait?

Nothing. And that’s the point.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney scoffed at the question, saying cancelling the speech wasn’t even considered and that what Obama did was “entirely appropriate” because “time is short.”

It’s hard to imagine that time is so short until the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline that a day’s delay in the speech would have been so damaging, especially because it was so similar to dozens of other addresses the president has given. But in Obamaland, time is always short. In their relentless battle to own every news cycle and keep bulldozing the political press, every second counts.

The president has had an almost uniformly bad start to his second term. Scandals, the woe-begotten implementation of his health law, a chaotic unraveling of the once-vaunted “Arab Spring,” the ascendancy of rival nations on the world stage and the intractable partisan standoff in Congress have left Americans skeptical of Obama’s election-year plea to “hold on” just a bit longer to let his agenda work.

[pullquote]

In survival mode and stripped of the political stars who helped the administration stay on offense for the first four years, Team Obama is looking bereft. The result of the White House summit of former political aides who helped the president settle on trying to hang the Syria debacle around the necks of Congressional Republicans suggest that David Axelrod & Co. themselves have lost their chops whilst lolling in MSNBC green rooms and Hoovering up corporate cash on K Street.

The old approach of living life on terms set by Politico and TV news means attacking, attacking, attacking and attacking. If you want to “win the day,” you’ve got to be in the day. While the approach long ago turned Obama into wallpaper, ignored through overexposure, it did provide lots of fresh video and soundbites to make sure that the Washington press corps always had something fresh (or at least freshly recycled) from the administration.

This manic inability to pause or to even seemingly take a breath has policy consequences. It’s hard to imagine that Obama’s zig-zagging on Syria is influenced by anything so much as an allergy to even a half news cycle of unflattering headlines from a previously doting press. Bad polls, bad press? Must mean it’s bad policy.

But now the approach is even losing the support of those to whom Obama is catering. Politico itself today noted that Obama found “tone a challenge.” The same folks who thrilled to every fresh round of partisan bear baiting and nodded approvingly at a president whose political strategy was to explode his rivals now notes that it was unclear “what benefit the White House hoped to reap in launching a major fall offensive in the middle of a national and local tragedy that consumed media attention all day.”

The intended benefit was to keep reporters tap, tap, tapping away at their keyboards around Obama’s story line. Obama staged an entire barnstorming tour this summer that seemed substantially aimed at scolding reporters for focusing too much on his scandals and not enough on his call for more government spending, and yet you wonder why he plowed ahead with his debt-limit speech.

He was doing it for you, Politico. And this is how you repay him?

Obama seems desperately afraid to allow any news cycle to proceed without being in it somewhere. Whether it was talking to “The Pimp With the Limp” and other local deejays in 2012 or doing a Web interview this year with Zillow, Obama is always there, trying to bulldoze his way through the news cycle.

This time, since the story was in the press corps’ backyard, it became all too much. A president whose relentlessness was once considered his cardinal virtue as a subject (and, by extension, a leader) suddenly became distasteful.

Obama will make up for this by being more effusive in the aftermath of the shooting, rightly realizing he has some amends to make. But on Monday, we got a window of the mania that grips this second-term White House: the fear of being ignored.

26 students from Sandy Hook will sing before kickoff

NFL to fly families to New Orleans later this week



League%2C players have shown extensive support to victims in wake of shooting

NEW ORLEANS — A little more than a month after the tragic mass shooting of 26 students and faculty at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a group of 26 students from the school will perform America the Beautiful during the Super Bowl XLVII pregame show, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday.

The league is flying the students and their families down to New Orleans later this week in advance of the performance, which will be broadcast live on CBS shortly before Alicia Keys performs the National Anthem.

The gesture will cap a season in which the league lent its support to the Newtown community via ""S.H.E.S."" stickers on helmets, personal messages on cleats and gloves, moments of silence before games and charitable donations for relief causes, as well other means of emotional support.

The New York Giants welcomed students and families onto the field during their pregame introductions before their Week 17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. That came a little less than two weeks after Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz paid an emotional visit to the family of 6-year-old Jack Pinto, a Cruz fan who was buried in a No. 80 Giants jersey.

""It was a time where I just wanted to be a positive voice, a positive light in a time where it can be very negative. It was a good time,"" Cruz said of his visit with the Pinto family. ""They're a great family and they are really united right now at this time. It was good to see.""

Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson auctioned off his game-worn cleats on which he wrote all of the victims' names and gave the proceeds to the United Way's Sandy Hook School Support Fund.

The Houston Texans were one of the teams that raised money for the victims. Defensive end J.J. Watt tweeted a picture of him and a handful of students on the field the Friday before Houston's Week 16 game against the Indianapolis Colts.

""I just kind of wanted to give them as normal a day as possible, just running around, having fun, going out on the field,"" Watt told USA TODAY Sports. ""We were kicking field goals. They were trying to put it through the uprights. Just be kids. And to see them in a normal setting, having fun and big smiles on their faces was awesome.""

A group of Sandy Hook students recently recorded a version of Over the Rainbow with pop singer Ingrid Michaelson at the home of Connecticut residents Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, with the proceeds going to Newtown Youth Academy and the United Way of Western Connecticut.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/11/Brown-realignment,2013-04-11 00:00:00,['Ben Shapiro'],CA Crime Skyrockets in Wake of Brown's Prison Release Plan,"In 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law California Assembly Bill 109, a piece of legislation designed to relieve overcrowded prisons in accordance with a Supreme Court decision. AB 109 enshrined “realignment” into law – a plan to place supposedly “non-violent, non-serious, and non-sex offenders” in county jails rather than state prisons. In other words, local governments were handed the problem of prisoners the state didn’t want to hold. On January 8, 2013, Brown said, “we’ve gone from serious constitutional problems to one of the finest prison systems in the United States.”

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation calls the realignment plan “historic legislation that has helped enable California to close the revolving door of low-level inmates cycling in and out of state prisons.” But in reality, realignment has created a revolving door for criminals: they cycle in, they leave, and they harm innocent citizens across the state.

David Mulder, 43, was shot and killed by police on Sunday night after stabbing a woman to death in a car near the San Bernardino Freeway. He had been released from prison early under realignment in September.

Last week, a felon with convictions for grand theft auto, drug possession, receiving stolen property, and robbery was arrested for an alleged rape in Fontana. The former inmate, Juan Francisco Aguilera, 30, had been turned over to county supervision.

In February, 34-year-old Raoul Leyva was convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter after beating his girlfriend, 21-year-old Brandy Marie Arreola, nearly to death. She still sits in a wheelchair, and has brain damage. She spent three months in a coma. Leyva was released early under realignment. He had already spent time in the system for domestic violence and parole violation.

These are not isolated incidents. They are evidence of a broad trend. According to statistics provided to Breitbart News by the office of Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 11,473 criminals have been sent to Los Angeles County jails rather than state penitentiaries since realignment kicked in. Over 43,000 inmates are doing their time in local jails rather than state pen. By 2014, that number will skyrocket to 54,000. Now here’s the kicker: under the Brown realignment plan, Los Angeles county misdemeanor offenders will serve approximately 10-15% of their sentences. Then they will be released. That number will drop as jails become more crowded.

More criminals, more crime. According to statistics from the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Probation Departments, burglaries have increased dramatically, from 175% in Hawaiian Gardens to 45% in South Los Angeles to 50% in Compton; auto theft is up 365% in Artesia, 100% in Marina Del Rey, and 92% in Bellflower. The Criminal Justice Legal Foundation reports that in the six-month period after realignment, California’s crime rates rose across the board, including a 7.6% jump in homicide. The recent Northridge boarding house murderer, who killed four people execution style, was out thanks to realignment. Tobias Dustin Summers, wanted for kidnapping a 10-year-old Southern California girl, was out due to realignment.

For his part, Jerry Brown maintains that we don’t need more prisons. “I don’t think that’s smart, and I don’t think the law requires it, and moreover, management of a prison is quintessentially an executive function,” he said in January. The proof is in our hands, and it is bloody.

According to federal law enforcement officials, the man was being interviewed about whether he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the bombing suspect, were connected to a two-year-old triple slaying when he attacked an FBI agent. There were conflicting accounts of what happened in the moments before the man was shot.

One federal law enforcement official said the man, a professional martial-arts fighter, was shot after trying to grab the FBI agent’s gun. Two other officials said the man reached for a knife and was shot as he attacked the agent. All three officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the episode is under official review.

The man was identified as Ibragim Todashev, 27, a former Boston area resident who knew Tsarnaev from martial-arts and boxing circles. Todashev had recently moved to Orlando from Cambridge, Mass.

Law enforcement officials said Todashev was not a suspect in the bombing. They said he was being interviewed about his possible role in a triple slaying in Waltham, Mass., in September 2011. They said Todashev acknowledged involvement in the killings and also implicated Tsarnaev in what the law enforcement officials described as a drug deal that went bad.

The FBI provided few details about the shooting in Orlando and did not mention the Waltham slayings, but the bizarre twist demonstrated the extent of the ongoing investigation into the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260.

Dozens of FBI agents and other law enforcement officers have been conducting interviews across the United States and in Russia with associates of Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhokhar, the other bombing suspect, to learn whether anyone else was associated with the Boston attack.

The interviews have focused largely on people from the northern Caucasus area of Russia, where Tamerlan Tsarnaev spent six months in 2012. The Tsarnaev family has roots in Chechnya, part of the restive region, and the FBI suspects that he might have had contact with Islamist militants there last year.

Reached Wednesday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, Anzor Tsarnaev, Tamerlan’s father, said that his son knew Todashev and that he believed the two had met while in the United States.

“All Chechens are like relatives,” the elder Tsarnaev said when told about the shooting in Florida. “This is all so sad.”

He questioned how Todashev could have been killed during an interrogation. “Why do they think they have the right to kill people?” he said. “It was a setup, like with Tamerlan.”

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police four days after the bombing. His brother was captured later that day and faces charges that could carry the death penalty. Before he was charged, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told the FBI that no one else was involved in the plot and that he and his brother had acted out of anger over the U.S. conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Shortly after midnight Wednesday, the FBI agent, two Massachusetts State Police officers and other law enforcement personnel went to Todashev’s apartment in a residential area near Universal Studios in Orlando to interview him about his relationship with Tsarnaev and their suspected ties to the Waltham slayings.

The law enforcement officials said he was initially cooperative and appeared to be on the verge of signing a confession when the interview turned into a confrontation. The FBI agent suffered minor injuries, and Todashev was fatally shot.

Todashev was arrested in early 2010 in Boston on charges including reckless driving. This month, he was arrested on a charge of aggravated battery after getting into a fight in an Orlando parking lot, according to police records. At the time of the Orlando arrest, he was driving a Mercedes with Georgia license plates.

Tsarnaev’s name had surfaced in earlier news reports about the Waltham slayings, which remain unsolved. Stephanie Guyotte, a spokeswoman for Middlesex County’s district attorney’s office, said the investigation is ongoing and refused to say whether Todashev or Tsarnaev was a suspect.

On Sept. 12, 2011, police found three men dead in a well-kept rental house on a short, quiet street in Waltham. The men were identified as Brendan Mess, 25, of Waltham, Erik Weissman, 31, of Cambridge and Raphael Teken, 37, of Cambridge. The Boston Globe and other news outlets have reported that Tsarnaev was friends with Mess and that the two met through boxing.

A woman who lived next door to the rental house said she was home that day and consoled Mess’s distraught girlfriend, who reportedly found the bodies and ran screaming outside. The neighbor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she does not want her name associated with the gruesome slayings, said she was told that the men had their throats slashed and that their bodies were covered with marijuana.

“She was horrified,” the neighbor said of the girlfriend. “We didn’t hear a thing that night. . . . The fact that all of this attention has come here again is very painful.”

Authorities say the men died early Sept. 12, but relatives of at least one of the victims insist that the men were killed Sept. 11, the 10th anniversary of the attacks in New York and at the Pentagon. Sept. 11 is the date listed on the tombstone of Weissman, according to photos posted on an online memorial.

At the time of the killings, Waltham police issued a statement saying that detectives did not think the attack was random and that the victims probably knew their attacker or attackers. The Middlesex district attorney’s office later said in a statement that the men died of “sharp-force injuries of the neck.’’

Two friends of Teken and Weissman said they believed the deaths were connected to a massive May 2011 drug bust in nearby Watertown. The bust followed a year-long investigation by federal authorities and resulted in charges against 18 people. Weissman was a founder of a company that produced glass bongs.

http://news.yahoo.com/obama-hails-courage-nations-police-officers-153947198.html,,[],Obama hails courage of nation's police officers,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Saturday praised the nation's police officers for everyday acts of courage, saying they often rush into danger to do ""some really tough stuff.""

In a White House ceremony honoring some of the bravest, he said America need look no further than the Boston Marathon bombings to know what police are made of: ""Police officers ... running towards explosions not knowing if there was something more on the way. Law enforcement from different agencies in different parts of the country working together as one united team to identify suspects and bring them to justice.""

He said few will ever forget the end of the marathon manhunt in Watertown, Mass. Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gunbattle with police, and residents cheered and gave police high fives after his brother Dzhokhar was apprehended.

""We don't always get that opportunity to stand and applaud the men and women who keep us safe,"" Obama said. ""But they're out there — hundreds of thousands of you patrolling our streets every single day. And we know that when we need you most, you'll be ready to dash into danger, to protect our lives, even if it means putting your lives on the line.""

Obama was flanked by award recipients, many in uniform, with families, friends and other officers looking on from the audience in the East Room.

The annual ceremony honored 43 law enforcement officers who are recipients of the National Association of Police Organizations TOP COPS award.

The group included eight officers from the Oak Creek, Wis., police force who battled a gunman at a Sikh temple last Aug. 5. The gunman killed six people before turning his weapon on himself. Obama singled out Brian Murphy, the first to arrive, who, he said, suffered 12 bullet wounds.

He also singled out New York police Detective Ivan Marcano, who was off duty in the Bronx with his girlfriend when he saw muggers attack a cab driver. Obama recounted Marcano being shot inches from his heart yet still giving chase to the suspects — holding his wound with one hand and his weapon with the other. Obama had Marcano's girlfriend stand, saying, ""This was his date night! It's unbelievable.""

Story continues

Other honorees included officers from California, Illinois, Iowa, Florida, Indiana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Wisconsin, as well as three FBI agents from Nevada.

""They'll tell you they're not heroes. They'll say they were just doing their jobs,"" Obama said. ""Today we honor them as TOP COPS because they're half right.""

He said they signed up knowing ""they might be called upon to do some really tough stuff. But I think that makes them more heroic, not less heroic.""

Obama added America owes police officers all the support it can give — including the resources and equipment to do their work. He said that includes enough money to prevent layoffs and what he termed ""common sense"" gun measures.

Obama's efforts to enact tighter background checks for gun purchases following last December's Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting have so far failed to make headway in the Senate.

Manning Granted Stay of Execution,"A Mississippi man scheduled to be put to death on Tuesday was granted a stay of execution by the State Supreme Court, after the United States Department of Justice sent lawyers and officials involved in the case several letters disavowing the degree of certainty expressed by F.B.I. forensic experts at the man’s trial.

About 2 p.m., just four hours before the scheduled execution, the court voted 8 to 1 to grant a reprieve “until further order” to Willie Jerome Manning, 44, who was convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students.

The justices in favor did not explain their reasoning or put a time limit on the reprieve. The dissenting justice issued a blistering objection, saying Mr. Manning had exhausted the challenges to his conviction and attacking the Justice Department for the letters, along with several other unrelated issues.

Starting Thursday, the Justice Department sent three letters calling certain aspects of the trial testimony of two F.B.I. experts “erroneous.” Defense lawyers cited these letters as reasons to put off the execution until DNA tests could be conducted on crime scene evidence, including a rape kit, a request that Mr. Manning had made unsuccessfully several times before."

Obama renewed his call for gun safety legislation

President Obama called the death of Trayvon Martin a tragedy Sunday, but urged ""calm reflection"" in the wake of a jury's verdict finding his killer not guilty.

""We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,"" Obama said in a statement posted on the White House web site following a Florida jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman Saturday.

Obama also used the occasion to renew his call for gun safety legislation, saying, ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives.""

The president's statement:

""The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin.""

Sarah Palin was plotting a move against the Republican Party chief at the state convention in 2008, Fulton was there strategizing over whiskey and cigars with Palin staffer Frank Bailey and Joe Miller, who later made a well-publicized run for the U.S. Senate as a tea party conservative.

That was the meeting where Fulton was introduced to Schaeffer Cox, an up-and-coming young firebrand of the far right who was running for the state Legislature and had, as it turned out, plans that went well beyond upending the Republican Party in Alaska.

It was a meeting that opened the door to a dangerous cat-and-mouse game that would transform the two men’s lives and leave them at opposite ends of one of the federal government’s biggest prosecutions of right-wing extremism on the West Coast.

Cox, 28, was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years in prison for heading a militia that plotted to kill judges and other government employees and conspired to accumulate the firepower needed to do it from Fulton. And Fulton, who became one of two key informants the FBI used to gather evidence against Cox and his cohorts, went from being the Alaska Peacemakers Militia’s “supply sergeant” to its most celebrated snitch.

Today, Fulton, 37, is nowhere to be found in Alaska.

The very moment that Cox and his associates were being arrested in Fairbanks in 2011, an FBI-paid moving van showed up at Fulton’s door in Anchorage — stunning his wife, who until then had known nothing about his double life — and the family relocated to another state. Fulton transferred his surplus store to his partners, sold his house at a loss, changed his appearance and went dark.

“They would have killed me immediately,” Fulton said at a cafe in his new hometown, as he sipped cappuccinos between furious smoking breaks outside. “If they found out I was working for the feds? I knew everybody up there in that right-wing militia area.... So there were quite a few people that would have liked to have offed me at some point.”

The story of Fulton’s foray as a militia arms supplier ended with not just Cox behind bars. Three codefendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 25 years. From his new base, Fulton is continuing to work with the FBI on other gun-related cases and writing a book about the improbable events that transpired in Anchorage over the last two years.

“If you look at it from a sane standpoint?” he said. “Even I sometimes look at the whole story and how it unfolded and I think, this is unbelievable.”

Fulton and the other FBI informant, former drug runner J.R. Olson, offered the FBI an inside look at a group that seemed to be moving from right-wing, antigovernment rants — perfectly legal under the 1st Amendment — to something more dangerous. Cox had been boasting that his militia planned to set up common-law courts that would try people under principles they saw as more faithful to the U.S. Constitution. Those found guilty of serious offenses could be hanged or sold into slavery.

Fulton, who had long worked with Army criminal investigators through his surplus shop, had gone to the FBI in 2010 about a potential domestic terrorism case when the FBI learned he knew Cox.

“The wheels started turning: How can we use this to our advantage, to try to get more information? Is Cox really going down that path? Which inevitably, he was,” said Sandra Klein, a supervisory special agent who became Fulton’s chief handler.

Fulton’s first assignment was to attend a gun and military surplus sale intended as a fundraiser for the Interior Alaska Conservative Coalition, which Cox had helped establish in Fairbanks. Cox had been trying to get in touch with Fulton, who had ignored him “because I thought he was an idiot.” The night before the event in August 2010, Fulton invited Cox to meet him at his hotel. The militiaman arrived with Les Zerbe, a retired missionary ranked as a captain, and another associate.

Cox had been accused of assaulting his wife, and worried that state authorities were trying to take his son away. He talked about Fulton serving what he called common-law warrants on the officials he thought were out to get him.

“He said these guys need to be arrested and brought to trial,” Fulton recalled. “I said, ‘What are you going to do with them?’ He said, ‘We’ll either fine them, or we’ll hang them.’”

Cox and company discussed how they were going to go to the homes of selected enemies, cut the electricity to the house, and make enough noise to lure their main target onto the front porch, where he could be shot. Then the windows and doors would be boarded up, and the house, with the rest of the family inside, would be set on fire. “Collateral damage” is the way Fulton said they described it.

After Cox left, Fulton phoned Klein. “I’m like, ‘Help! What am I supposed to do? Do I need to get my family out of here?’ And she’s like, ‘We’ll handle it. Just try to figure out as much as you can.’ She was really good at calming me down, but even for her, I could tell it was stressing her out.”

The next day was the gun show, and Fulton again met with Cox, along with others from various militias.

“We walk into this meeting, and they’re wanding everyone. If you had a gun that was fine. They were looking for electronic listening devices,” Fulton recalled.

Fulton said he sensed that he needed to make it apparent to everyone that he was a tough guy who could be counted on, and he went on the offensive with Cox.

“I said, ‘Listen, you’re a piece of.... You brought all these people in this room. You said you had a plan; you don’t have a plan.’”

Zerbe walked up to him. “He says, ‘You were never going to help us anyway,’” Fulton recounted. “I saw the doubt start to come up.... If they had for a minute mistrusted what I was saying, I probably would have been dead.” He walked toward Zerbe. “I said, ‘If you ever question me, I’ll slit your throat and bleed you out at my feet.’”

Someone intervened and calmed everyone down. Fulton said he told Cox not to worry — he’d help him get what he needed.

At the next meeting, several months later in Anchorage, Fulton was playing the role of arms dealer. With FBI agents eavesdropping nearby, both Fulton and Olson — neither knew the other one was working as an informant — met with militia members, with Cox joining in by speaker phone.

“We discussed their shopping list. Explosives: C4, Semtex, fragmentation grenades … machine guns, silenced weapons. Pretty much a laundry list of bad things,” Fulton said.

Within a month, in March 2011, Fulton flew up to Fairbanks and handed over some of the illegal armament to Olson, who then met up with the defendants in a parking lot. He was about to hand over pistols, silencers and grenades when the parking lot owner walked up to the vehicle and asked what was going on. FBI agents rushed in and made the arrests.

By this time, Fulton was already on his way back to Anchorage.

“I flew home and tried to explain to my wife why there was a moving van at my home,” he said. “We knew that once the arrests went down, it was going to be literally days before people figured out who at least one of the informants was. We needed to be gone by the time those questions even started to be asked.”

Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven Skrocki, who prosecuted the case, scoffed at the assertions of Cox and others that Fulton scared them into talking about plans to kill federal officials. “The argument that Bill Fulton was a danger to Mr. Cox comes only from Mr. Cox,” Skrocki said.

Did Fulton need to go into hiding? Are there people in Alaska who’d like to kill him?

Klein and her co-agent, Derek Espeland, seem dubious. But they say they’ve been in enough investigations to know what it feels like to operate undercover with bad guys.

Advertisement

“You go somewhere and you try not to be detected. And yeah, you have a little bit of fear,” Klein said.

Fulton is trying to finish his book, which he hopes will earn some money. He collected $39,000 from the federal government for his work on the Cox case, but figures he lost a lot more, what with his house, his business and the money he spent playing the big guy in the militia movement.

Still, he’s getting monthly disability payments for an old Army injury. His wife has a job. And for the first time in several years, he’s spending the winter in some place that isn’t Alaska.

Army sergeant accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians

Army says Sgt. Bales shot or stabbed 16 people%2C including women and children

By pleading guilty%2C Bales avoids death penalty

JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. — Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty Wednesday to the slaying of 16 Afghan civilians in 2012, telling a military judge, ""Sir, as far as why: I've asked that question a million times since then. There's not a good reason in this world for why I did the horrible things I did.""

The judge, Col. Jeffery Nance, accepted the plea, ensuring that Bales will avoid the death penalty.

A jury will decide in August whether he will be sentenced to life in prison with or without the possibility of parole.

Bales, 39, entered the plea to premeditated murder and other charges. Nance explained Bales' rights and asked if he understood them. Bales stood and answered, ""Yes, sir, I do.""

Bales, dressed in full uniform, was alert and spoke in a confident voice as he answered the judge's questions, surrounded by six friends and family.

Defense attorneys John Henry Browne and Emma Scanlan said after the hearing that Bales is seeking a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years.

""There is no death penalty on the table, and there is the opportunity for life with parole,'' Browne said. ""We never thought we'd get there.''

Bales told the judge he had been drinking contraband alcohol, snorting Valium and taking steroids before the attack. He was serving his fourth tour in a combat zone. The allegations against him raised questions about the toll multiple deployments take on U.S. servicemembers.

Bales told the court that he had been taking the steroids to improve his fitness and that they ""definitely increased my irritability and anger.''

The steroid, stanozolol, is a class three controlled substance. Bales was taking it without a prescription or authorization.

The Ohio native and father of two from Lake Tapps, Wash., was charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder in the shootings or stabbings of mostly women and children. He was accused of slipping away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early March 11, 2012, and attacking mud-walled compounds in two nearby villages.

Bales described one of the killings, saying he ""went to the nearby village of Alkozai. While inside a compound in Alkozai, I observed a female I now know to be Na'ikmarga. I formed the intent to kill Na'ikmarga, and I did kill Na'ikmarga by shooting her with a firearm. This act was without legal justification, sir.""

Nine of the victims, five women and four men, were shot first, and their bodies were burned.

""I remember there being a lantern in the room,'' Bales told the judge. ""I remember there being a fire after that situation, and I remember coming back ... with matches in my pocket."" He said he did not remember throwing the lantern on the bodies, but ""I have seen the pictures, and it's the only thing that makes sense. ""

After killing four people in the first village, he returned to his base, then went out again, he said. When the judge asked him what he expected to do, he said he expected to find people and, ""Sir, I expected to kill them. ""

Bales is with the Army's 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team.

Joint Base Lewis-McChord is an amalgamation of the Army's Fort Lewis and the Air Force's McChord Air Force Base. It supports more than 40,000 active-duty Guard and Reserve servicemembers. Bales worked on the base and lived about 30 miles west of it.

The Senate will vote Thursday on whether to bring gun bills to the floor

14 Republicans say they plan to block votes on gun bills

It is unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate to end the filibuster

WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that beginning Thursday, the Senate will hold votes on gun control — with or without a Republican filibuster.

As a bipartisan compromise proved elusive, Reid scheduled a vote to end debate on Thursday. Even if he falls short of the 60 votes needed to end debate, he said he'll make Republicans filibuster the bill until he gets a vote. ""It will take a little bit of time, but we're going to do it,"" he said.

""We need to move to this legislation … and let the cards fall where they may,"" he told reporters following a closed-door Democratic meeting.

Reid's action starts the clock on what will be the most intense debate on gun control since the 1994 crime bill. But even now, the exact shape of the legislation is very much undefined.

More than an hour after a 5 p.m. target for a compromise on criminal background checks for gun purchases, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., emerged from the majority leader's office without a Plan B.

""We're closer than we've ever been,"" Schumer said.

""These have all been great talks,"" Manchin said.

The compromise Manchin was trying to forge with Sen. Pat Toomey, the Republican from the neighboring Appalachian state of Pennsylvania, will have to come Wednesday — if it comes at all. They're working on a plan to expand background checks and close the ""gun show loophole.""

Other amendments in the works: A mental health provision by Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, language regulating the size of ammunition magazines by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's ban on certain types of assault weapons.

It's not clear whether there are 60 votes to end debate, and Reid conceded he didn't know, either. Several Republican senators have indicated they will vote with Democrats to end the filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote on the gun bill.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., said on MSNBC Tuesday ""I don't support a filibuster for this,"" and Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said on CBS that although it was still unclear what would be in the bill, ""I think it deserves a vote up or down.""

Other Republican senators who have expressed reservations about a filibuster include John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.

Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., wouldn't say outright whether he would support the Republican filibuster Tuesday, saying the final bill had not yet been released.

""I'll be anxious to see what the actual gun legislation looks like when Sen. Reid finally is ready to bring it to the floor and whether it has amendments on it or not,"" he said. ""But as a general principle, I believe it's always better to debate the bill.""

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, had a similar answer, telling reporters that he hadn't seen the final bill.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he welcomed a debate on the issue. ""I will vote to proceed with the bill if I get assurances that we can offer meaningful amendments,"" he said. ""I don't fear the debate; I welcome the debate. That's just me.""

Vice President Biden said Tuesday that the prospect of a Republican filibuster was ""mind-boggling"" and said the issue ""isn't going away.""

But Reid may not have all his Democratic votes, either. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is ill and will not be in the Senate this week to vote, and at least two leading Democrats, Sens. Max Baucus of Montana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, have not said whether they will support Reid's effort to move to the gun bill. Pryor confirmed to reporters Tuesday that he hadn't decided on whether to vote to proceed on the gun bill.

""I don't get all the Democrats all the time,"" Reid said. ""That's for sure.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defended the filibuster. ""In my view, every senator has a responsibility to actively protect the Bill of Rights,"" he said. ""Any bill that would undermine the Bill of Rights, in my view, should be subject to a 60-vote threshold.""

But he deflected questions on whether he had enough senators to block a vote, or whether Tea Party-allied senators would take to the floor in a ""talking filibuster,"" such as the one Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., conducted last month on President Obama's nominee to head the CIA.

""I would be happy spending the next two or three weeks on the floor of the Senate debating this,"" Cruz said. ""There's an irony to the calls for 'Let's have a debate.' We're having the debate right now.""

(CNN) —

Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, has given a wide-ranging interview to The Washington Post about the effects of the startling information he shared this year with journalists, shedding light on the U.S. surveillance apparatus.

The revelations from Snowden, a former NSA contractor, about the American government’s surveillance of its citizens and allies have generated fierce debate over intelligence-gathering practices.

Here are five key takeaways from the interview, the first Snowden has given in person since he arrived in Russia in June.

Snowden says …

1. His mission is ‘already accomplished’

“For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission’s already accomplished. I already won,” Snowden told The Washington Post’s Barton Gellman in Moscow. “As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn’t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself.”

Snowden left his job in Hawaii with the NSA contract firm Booz Allen Hamilton and fled to Hong Kong in May, taking with him a hoard of secret information about intelligence programs. He shared the files with Gellman and journalists from The Guardian, a British newspaper.

The ensuing articles about how the NSA hoovers up vast amounts of phone and Internet data about American citizens sparked an uproar, with Snowden described as a hero by some and a traitor by others. Many more articles about other controversial aspects of U.S. surveillance have followed, and Snowden has said there’s plenty more information still to be revealed.

His actions have had clear consequences.

A review of NSA surveillance practices ordered by the White House has recommended changes to the program, including greater judicial oversight and more public transparency in the collection of data. Key American allies, like Germany and Brazil, have publicly condemned U.S. surveillance of their leaders.

“All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed,” Snowden said. “That is a milestone we left a long time ago. Right now, all we are looking at are stretch goals.”

Gellman told CNN that his impression was not that Snowden was gloating, but that his goal to strip some of the secrecy off the NSA’s activities had been achieved.

2. He’s become ‘an indoor cat’

Snowden has so far managed to dodge the U.S. government’s attempts to bring him back to America to face charges of espionage and theft of government property. And he’s not taking any chances as he lives in asylum in Russia.

Gellman reported that during more than 14 hours of conversations in Moscow, Snowden didn’t once “part the curtains or step outside.”

Snowden, 30, described his life as that of an “indoor cat.” He said he doesn’t drink alcohol and lives on ramen noodles and chips.

“It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house,” he told Gellman. “I just don’t have a lot of needs. … Occasionally there’s things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish. But it’s really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that’s more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks.”

Gellman said Snowden is the kind of person who usually keeps to himself indoors anyway.

He said Snowden does not want to continuing being part of the story, but wants to see his cause advance.

Snowden has had continuous access to the Internet and talks to journalists and his lawyers on a daily basis, the Post reported.

People who visit him bring him books, but he doesn’t read them, preferring to get his information from the Internet.

Gellman reported that it was unclear to what degree Snowden was under surveillance by Russian authorities, saying that “no retinue” accompanied Snowden and that he didn’t see anybody else nearby.

3. He raised flags before going public

Snowden said some other people who worked for the NSA’s surveillance system also had misgivings about the activities.

He told Gellman that he raised concerns with colleagues and with superiors in the NSA’s Technology Directorate and the NSA Threat Operations Center’s regional base in Hawaii.

His co-workers were often “astonished to learn we are collecting more in the United States on Americans than we are on Russians in Russia,” Snowden told the Post.

A lot of his colleagues were disturbed by what they heard, Snowden said, and several asked him not to tell them any more.

“I asked these people, ‘What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?’ ” he said, according to the Post.

“How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?” he said in response to criticism that he circumvented the NSA’s internal channels for disagreement.

The NSA said in a statement to the Post that it had “not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.”

4. The intelligence community’s overseers ‘elected’ him

Snowden has faced widespread criticism over his actions from Obama administration officials and members of Congress. But he told Gellman that the U.S. government left him little choice.

Asked why he felt entitled to bring the NSA’s intrusive activities to public attention, Snowden told the Post: “That whole question – who elected you? – inverts the model. They elected me. The overseers.”

He singled out the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers, both of whom have voiced criticism of his leaks.

“It wasn’t that they put it on me as an individual – that I’m uniquely qualified, an angel descending from the heavens – as that they put it on someone, somewhere,” he said. “You have the capability, and you realize every other (person) sitting around the table has the same capability but they don’t do it. So somebody has to be the first.”

He said his aim was not to bring down the NSA, but to improve it.

“I am still working for the NSA right now,” he said. “They are the only ones who don’t realize it.”

5. Personal attacks don’t faze him

Ever since he stepped into the public eye, Snowden has insisted that he should not be at the center of the story. The real issue, he says, is the NSA’s far-reaching surveillance programs.

He maintained that stance with Gellman, saying that he’s shrugged off personal attacks against him with the intent of keeping the focus on the NSA.

“Let them say what they want,” he said. “It’s not about me.”

He dismissed suggestions that he’s made any deals with the governments of the countries where he’s taken refuge from U.S. authorities.

“There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States,” Snowden told Gellman. “I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them.”

“If I defected at all,” Snowden said, “I defected from the government to the public.”"

"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/clout/chi-gay-marriage-assault-weapons-ban-votes-delayed-in-illinois-senate-20130103,0,6351516.story",,"['Ray Long', 'Rick Pearson']","Gay marriage, assault weapons ban votes delayed in Illinois Senate","SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois Senate left the State Capitol later today without voting on measures to legalize gay marriage and outlaw assault weapons, leaving the fate of those controversial issues in doubt.



A committee advanced the same-sex marriage bill late this afternoon, but the sponsor acknowledged she did not have enough votes to win approval on the Senate floor.



Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, dismissed a question on whether she ever had a solid 30 votes lined up to pass the legislation. ""Oh, no, no, no,"" Steans said. ""We really did have the votes. We were just missing members today.""



Such are the political dynamics of a lame-duck session in Springfield: some lawmakers who are in their final days of service don't show up to work, making it difficult to pass tough legislation.



The Senate's failure to take a final vote also came after a furious lobbying pushback by the Catholic Conference of Illinois and Cardinal Francis George.



The Senate Executive Committee advanced the measure on an 8-5 vote following a lengthy debate that featured testimony from both sides of the issue.



""It's not often that we really have a chance in this chamber to be taking a look at something providing a basic civil right and advancing fairness,"" said sponsoring Sen. Steans. ""Same-sex couples want to marry for the same reasons we all do--for commitment, family, mutual responsibility.



Steans said gay couples have suffered from the 2nd-class status. Underscoring Steans' point was emotional testimony from Mercedes Santos and Theresa Volpe, a lesbian couple from Rogers Park who got a civil union in Illinois.



""Right now, we are in a civil union, but it is not enough,"" testified Theresa Volpe.



Springfield Catholic Bishop Thomas John Paprocki testified against the proposal, saying, ""It would radically redefine what marriage is for everybody."" He maintained the ""natural family"" is undermined by the legislation.



""Neither two men nor two women can possibly form a marriage,"" Paprocki said. ""Our law would be wrong if it said that they could.



""The basic structure of marriage as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman, committed to a life with the potential of having children, is given to us in human nature, and thus by nature's God,"" Paprocki said.



At the same time, an effort to ban semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines --- backed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel --- also lacked the votes needed for passage. Opponents argued the measure was too broad and unworkable.



With no action on those two controversial issues, senators were preparing to return home. A final day of the Senate's lame-duck session remains an option for Tuesday, the day before the next General Assembly is inaugurated. But that could depend on whether the House takes any action. House members are scheduled to be in Springfield from Sunday through Tuesday.

RELATED: NYPD Will Review Its Massive Stop-and-Frisk Policy

If you missed Barack Obama's impromptu speech last Friday on the realities of growing up black in the same country as Trayvon Martin, this is the passage that's most essential for understanding why New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would make a baffling choice to become the country's top domestic security official:

You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there’s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it’s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that -- that doesn’t go away. There are very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. And there are very few African-American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me, at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven’t had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.

MORE FROM THE ATLANTIC CITIES

Stop-and-frisk, the deeply controversial policing tactic that Kelly has led and defended in New York City, is essentially the institutional version of everything that Obama describes above. The only difference is that the people following blacks in New York, eying them with distrust and suspecting them of being up to no good, are police officers. And they have the power to pat people down and detain them, one indignity piled onto another.

Story continues

RELATED: Proper Etiquette for When You're Under Arrest

Obama was explicitly trying to bring ""context"" to the outpouring of anger following last week's ruling in Florida. But his words also offer the best context imaginable for why the architect of stop-and-frisk would be a bizarre nominee to become Obama's head of the Department of Homeland Security, a move that would implicitly endorse at the federal level the tactic of preemptively profiling minorities in massive numbers to head off crime.

RELATED: NYPD Releases Graphic Video of Empire State Building Shootout

Obama himself is the source of all this speculation. Janet Napolitano announced earlier this month that she was stepping down from Homeland Security. And there's wide speculation that Kelly will no longer have a job in New York after this fall's mayoral election. Asked last week what he thought of Kelly as a potential replacement, Obama lauded his record and said this: ""Mr. Kelly might be very happy where he is. But if he’s not, I’d want to know about it.”

RELATED: A Stop and Frisk Class Action Lawsuit Would Be Massive

And yet, if you parse out their public statements on this subject, it's almost as if these two men have been having an ongoing conversation about racial profiling from opposing podiums at the same rally. Here is Obama, again, last Friday:

... the fact that a lot of African-American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, well, there are these statistics out there that show that African-American boys are more violent -- using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain.

Compare that to Kelly, last year, citing those very statistics in defense of stop-and-frisk:

Ninety-six percent of the shooting victims in this city are people of color, 90 percent of the murder victims are people of color. Who do you think's lives are being saved?

Here is Obama on Friday acknowledging that the black community knows and talks about these statistics:

… Now, this isn’t to say that the African-American community is naive about the fact that African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence. It’s not to make excuses for that fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context. And so the fact that sometimes that’s unacknowledged adds to the frustration.

And here is Kelly, in the same diatribe... not acknowledging that:

What I haven’t heard is any solution to the violence problem in these communities. People are upset about being stopped, yet what is the answer? What have you said about how do we stop this violence? What have leaders of the communities of color said? What is their strategy to get guns off the street?

Here is Obama on Friday proposing that we might soothe the fear and anger in the minority community by training local police officers on how not to racially profile:

Number one, precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the state and local level, I think it’d be productive for the Justice Department -- governors, mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists. You know, when I was in Illinois I passed racial profiling legislation. And it actually did just two simple things. One, it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped. But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing.

And here is Kelly seeming to argue on the television show Nightline this spring that, in fact, New York's stop-and-frisk program doesn't profile minorities enough:

The stark reality is that crime happens in communities of color. About 70% to 75% of the people described as committing violent crimes — assault, robbery, shootings, grand larceny — are described as being African-American. The percentage of people who are stopped is 53% African-American. So really, African-Americans are being understopped in relation to the percentage of people being described as being the perpetrators of violent crime.

None of this even touches on the NYPD's policies of surveilling Muslims. That program is equally troubling to many Kelly critics. But given Obama's own powerful articulation of what it's like to be on the other end of racial profiling as a black man, the discordant comments from Kelly on the very same topic would seem to disqualify him from expanding his ideas beyond New York."
http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/08/16/building-trust-between-police-and-minority-communities/,2013-08-16 00:00:00,"['Joseph D. Mcnamara', 'Posted Oneofthesheep', 'Posted Tmc', 'Posted Ptiffany', 'Posted Camp Williams Utah']",Building trust between police and minority communities,"A federal judge ruled Monday that the stop-and-frisk policies of the New York City Police Department were unconstitutional. That same day, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the Justice Department will pull back from prosecuting low-level drug offenders to avoid triggering harsh mandatory sentences.

Both decisions reflect fundamental changes in U.S. law enforcement practices. The resulting strident opposition to the changes and equally adamant support illuminate the deep disagreements in the nation’s unresolved racial divide.

Holder pointed out that mandatory sentences fell disproportionately on minority communities and had led to grossly overcrowded prisons. Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that the New York police policy violated the Constitution — police are most often stopping and frisking innocent male minorities.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly quickly defended the policy. They both argued that the tactics had greatly reduced violence and crime — and the number of minority crime victims. Supporters of mandatory sentences and stop-and- frisk contend that, most importantly, policy changes would lead to far higher crime levels.

My decade-long experience as a beat officer in New York’s Harlem, the highest crime area in the city during the 1960s, when crime soared, and as police chief of Kansas City, Missouri, and San Jose, California, during the high-crime 1970s and ’80s, convinced me that police tactics and judicial sentencing policies do affect crime rates.

It is also true, however, that many other variables play a significant role. Demographic and economic factors, community culture and leadership, education, unemployment, the patterns of local drug use and gangs, drug enforcement efforts and police crime reporting practices are all factors.

My years as a beat cop taught me truths that were invaluable as police chief. I learned that the magnitude of the evil imposed on African-Americans by slavery didn’t just vanish with the Emancipation Proclamation. It still contributed to the high rates of black-on-black violence and crime, often by black youths against poor people in their communities, which were ill-served by indifferent police, courts and correctional organizations.

Drug War enforcement did not reduce drug use, but Bureau of Justice statistics show that mandatory minimum sentencing disproportionately filled prisons with low-level black offenders to the point where, according to the most recent data, roughly 80 percent of young African-Americans can expect to be jailed during their life time. Since the recidivism rate is around 68 percent it is no surprise that many inner-city African-American communities suffer from exceedingly high victimization. Forty-nine percent of homicide victims are African-American, despite the fact that blacks make up only 13 percent of the population.

Nonetheless, it is understandable that an innocent African-American, confronted and frisked by an armed, uniformed officer, may feel that his dignity as a man is violated, creating a potentially violent encounter. It is important that such situations are perceived as an officer taking necessary action to protect neighborhood residents, at their bequest.

During the 18 years I served as police chief, I attended countless community meetings throughout both cities. I often heard residents complain about sporadic police encounters. Inevitably, however, the minority community would admonish, “Chief, don’t mistake what we’re saying. We don’t want less policing. We want more, but we want it to be without racial bias.”

As part of good management, police departments should be assigning the most cops to higher crime areas which, unfortunately, are often among the poor in minority neighborhoods. They require more policing, not less. People in those areas, in my experience, will accept that most police interactions will be with minority youth. So the burden for the police agencies is to establish community trust and ensure that cops behave professionally as they do their work.

I made it mandatory for beat officers and their superiors to attend and participate in neighborhood meetings. Cops who thought a community hated them and sided with law-breakers quickly learned differently. The local residents also began to see officers as dedicated and caring — not as members of an occupying army.

It didn’t solve all problems, of course. But it did go a long way toward establishing enough trust so that when inevitable difficulties and misunderstandings arose, people would withhold judgment until all the facts were in. Which is all that we could ask. Ultimately, increased public participation created a partnership supporting police actions, which helped make San Jose the safest large city in the nation at that time.

No one can predict for sure that crime will increase if police stop-and-frisk policies are eliminated. But the New York Police Department’s promise to improve the process deserves consideration when the federal appellate court reviews the decision.

While the stop-and-frisk policies can be re-evaluated, common sense tells us that prison populations can and should be reduced. It is time to put aside the hysterical rhetoric of the Drug War, because it causes far more harm to lock up drug users than to use viable alternatives, like drug treatment or community service work for minor offenses.

The federal government declared a war on drugs in 1914 by passing the Harrison Act, which first made drug possession and use a crime. More than a century later, prohibition of drugs enriches drug cartels and corrupt officials. There have been unprecedented levels of drug use and drug gang violence, while minor, non-violent drug offenders were given severe mandatory sentences. It would be better to repeal unworkable drug sentencing laws than to have the attorney general try an end run — but it is still well past time to stop making drug cartels rich and turning minor users into career criminals.

The judge stated that she did not rule on whether or not stop and frisk reduces crime but only on the constitutionality of the NYPD policies. The appeal courts will ultimately rule on the program’s constitutionality. But ultimately the public will need to vote on the appropriateness of the methods police can use to protect safety.

The real reason the Second Amendment was ratified, and why it says ""State"" instead of ""Country"" (the Framers knew the difference - see the 10th Amendment), was to preserve the slave patrol militias in the southern states, which was necessary to get Virginia's vote. Founders Patrick Henry, George Mason, and James Madison were totally clear on that . . . and we all should be too.

In the beginning, there were the militias. In the South, they were also called the ""slave patrols,"" and they were regulated by the states.

y the time the Constitution was ratified, hundreds of substantial slave uprisings had occurred across the South. Blacks outnumbered whites in large areas, and the state militias were used to both prevent and to put down slave uprisings. As Dr. Bogus points out, slavery can only exist in the context of a police state, and the enforcement of that police state was the explicit job of the militias.

If the anti-slavery folks in the North had figured out a way to disband - or even move out of the state - those southern militias, the police state of the South would collapse. And, similarly, if the North were to invite into military service the slaves of the South, then they could be emancipated, which would collapse the institution of slavery, and the southern economic and social systems, altogether.

These two possibilities worried southerners like James Monroe, George Mason (who owned over 300 slaves) and the southern Christian evangelical, Patrick Henry (who opposed slavery on principle, but also opposed freeing slaves).

Their main concern was that Article 1, Section 8 of the newly-proposed Constitution, which gave the federal government the power to raise and supervise a militia, could also allow that federal militia to subsume their state militias and change them from slavery-enforcing institutions into something that could even, one day, free the slaves.

This seems like a plausible interpretation of constitutional history to me. The northern and southern states had come together to defeat the British but they were divided by very different economic and cultural systems. The tensions that would eventually lead to the civil war were already very present in the convention in Philadelphia. Much of the negotiation revolved around crafting compromises between the two regions. The most notorious of them was counting slaves as 3/5 of a person. The constitution also set a date for the importation of additional slaves to end. The nation about to be born was not at peace about slavery.

I have always been puzzled by the language in the second amendment about a well regulated militia. There was provision in the constitution for a standing army and navy. What was really meant by a militia? This makes very good sense that the slave states demanded military type forces under their direct control for the purpose of controlling their slave society. If you tie the right to keep and bear arms directly to the existence of a militia, then the whole thing is seriously out of date and nothing more than an historical anachronism. It seems to me that many of the people on the far right who are frothing at the mouth over their guns come off as being seriously anachronistic as well."

A committee advanced the same-sex marriage bill late this afternoon, but the sponsor acknowledged she did not have enough votes to win approval on the Senate floor.

Sen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, dismissed a question on whether she ever had a solid 30 votes lined up to pass the legislation. ""Oh, no, no, no,"" Steans said. ""We really did have the votes. We were just missing members today.""

Such are the political dynamics of a lame-duck session in Springfield: some lawmakers who are in their final days of service don't show up to work, making it difficult to pass tough legislation.

The Senate’s failure to take a final vote also came after a furious lobbying pushback by the Catholic Conference of Illinois and Cardinal Francis George.

The Senate Executive Committee advanced the measure on an 8-5 vote following a lengthy debate that featured testimony from both sides of the issue.

""It's not often that we really have a chance in this chamber to be taking a look at something providing a basic civil right and advancing fairness,"" said sponsoring Sen. Steans. ""Same-sex couples want to marry for the same reasons we all do--for commitment, family, mutual responsibility.

Steans said gay couples have suffered from the 2nd-class status. Underscoring Steans' point was emotional testimony from Mercedes Santos and Theresa Volpe, a lesbian couple from Rogers Park who got a civil union in Illinois.

""Right now, we are in a civil union, but it is not enough,"" testified Theresa Volpe.

Springfield Catholic Bishop Thomas John Paprocki testified against the proposal, saying, ""It would radically redefine what marriage is for everybody."" He maintained the ""natural family"" is undermined by the legislation.

""Neither two men nor two women can possibly form a marriage,"" Paprocki said. ""Our law would be wrong if it said that they could.

""The basic structure of marriage as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman, committed to a life with the potential of having children, is given to us in human nature, and thus by nature's God,"" Paprocki said.

At the same time, an effort to ban semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines --- backed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel --- also lacked the votes needed for passage. Opponents argued the measure was too broad and unworkable.

With no action on those two controversial issues, senators were preparing to return home. A final day of the Senate’s lame-duck session remains an option for Tuesday, the day before the next General Assembly is inaugurated. But that could depend on whether the House takes any action. House members are scheduled to be in Springfield from Sunday through Tuesday.

On the way back to his car, Acree, a pastor, spotted a television in the lobby of the parking garage. A crowd had gathered in front, as if “watching the football game,” Acree said. President Obama was speaking.

In his first comments since a six-woman jury acquitted George Zimmerman of murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, Obama spoke frankly and reflectively, relating his experiences with race and racial profiling. “Trayvon Martin could have been me,” the president said.

Obama’s earnest words moved Acree almost to tears.

“I just think that the president’s words may help whites across the nation at least understand us,” Acree said. “And be a little bit more emphathetic toward our actions tomorrow.”

Acree chairs the board of a social justice group in Chicago called the Leader’s Network, which is helping organize Saturday’s vigil.

The 100-city “Justice for Trayvon” vigils, which the Rev. Al Sharpton announced Tuesday on the steps of the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., will be staged mostly at federal court buildings across the country. In California, rallies are scheduled in Los Angeles, Oakland, Palmdale, Riverside, Sacramento, San Francisco and the Monterey County city of Seaside.

Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, and Martin’s brother, Jahvaris, will attend a rally in New York City, along with Sharpton. Martin’s father, Tracy Martin, is attending a vigil in Miami.

With the vigils, organizers are hoping to build momentum for the filing of federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

A day after the jury delivered a not-guilty verdict, Sharpton’s civil rights organization, the National Action Network, held a conference call with local organizers.

Earl S. Wagner, a minister with the Ordinary People Society in Montgomery, Ala., was on the call. He listened as Sharpton emphasized that the Trayvon Martin case was “a federal civil rights issue, and that we need to bring that light to the public.”

“It’s no longer a states’ rights issue,” Wagner said. “It’s very important that we stand together.”

He added: “This is not just a racial thing. This a civil rights thing.”

The Montgomery rally, scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. at the U.S. Federal Courthouse, was organized in conjunction with the NAACP local chapter and students from Alabama State University, a historically black institution, Wagner said.

Organizers plan to start off with a call for the Department of Justice to determine whether federal prosecutors will file civil rights charges. From there, the rally will turn into a march to the state Capitol, where speakers will address the crowds.

Wagner said city and law enforcement officials have stood “wholeheartedly” behind the efforts of organizers.

“Alabama, in particular Montgomery, is the cradle of the civil rights movement,” Wagner said. “It’s very important we continue to help make this into a national movement.”

He added that he would be “very happy” if 300 people showed up, though some rumors were numbering the expected turnout at more than 1,000.

Organizers said it’s tough to guess at the expected turnout in each city.

“We have no idea at this point,” Lawanna Gelzer, a spokeswoman for the rally in Orlando, Fla., told the Los Angeles Times. “The more people find out about it, the more it’s advertised, the more people will show up just to hear.”

In Orlando, organizers made parking arrangements and told attendees to bring chairs. Signs are allowed, but no sticks.

Gelzer said the rally at the city’s U.S. Federal Courthouse will open up with a vigil, followed by a discussion of other cases where the “stand your ground” law came into play – particularly the case of Marissa Alexander, a Florida mother of three who was denied a “stand your ground” hearing and sentenced to 20 years in prison after she fired a shot at a wall of her Jacksonville home during an argument with her abusive husband. Zimmerman waived his right for a “stand your ground” hearing, but his attorneys said he acted in self defense.

Gelzer said rally-goers plan to call for a constitutional amendment to repeal the law -- a sentiment recently echoed by Democratic leaders in the Florida Legislature.

Thursday evening, Florida Gov. Rick Scott met with a group of young protesters called the Dream Defenders, who took over Scott’s office three days earlier. The protesters were demanding that Scott call a special session of the Legislature to repeal the “Stand Your Ground” Law.

Scott refused the demands. But he issued a proclamation declaring Sunday a “day of prayer” for Florida.

USA TODAY

The Rand Paul vs. Chris Christie spat appears to be getting nastier.

Paul, a Kentucky senator, escalated his attacks on the New Jersey governor, saying on Fox News that it is ""kind of sad and cheap"" that his fellow Republican is using ""the cloak of 9/11 victims"" to criticize him on national security.

Christie followed up Tuesday with a shot about Kentucky's federal spending, along with his trademark straight talk. ""Get in line"" if you've got a personal problem with his bluntness, the governor said.

While Christie and Paul are both mentioned as potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016, their verbal fusillades aren't a sideshow. Their dispute about national security and federal spending exposes the fissures within the GOP -- similar to another battle being waged now over immigration -- that will likely be played out in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina during the presidential primaries.

This all began last week when Christie said at an Aspen Institute forum that there is a ""strain of libertarianism"" within the Republican Party by those who oppose the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance program and other counterterrorism techniques. The governor said Paul and others in the GOP could come to New Jersey and explain their opposition to the ""widows and orphans"" who lost loved ones in the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

Paul's first response Sunday was to go after Christie on federal spending, and what he called a ""gimme, gimme, gimme"" attitude when it came to Superstorm Sandy aid.

During a Fox News appearance Monday, the Kentucky senator teed off again. First, Paul said the Republican Party in the Northeast is ""on life support"" and that ""it's not real smart for Republicans to be attacking Republicans."" Then Paul threw 9/11 back at Christie before repeating the federal spending charge.

Christie said Tuesday that he's got ""nothing personal"" against the senator, but said Paul's words seem as though ""he has something personal against me, but that's OK. He can just get in line on that front.""

As for the charges on federal spending, Christie noted that New Jersey gets back 61 cents for every dollar sent to Washington while Kentucky receives $1.51. ""Maybe he should start cutting the pork-barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,"" the governor said.

Sounds like the ball is back in Paul's court. Over to you, senator.

Though they generally make things up to turn the death of innocents into a talking point against the Right, it is still the left who set this precedent.

And what do you know, Chris Dorner, the former police officer suspected of being behind the murder rampage presently unfolding in Los Angeles, has apparently left behind a manifesto addressed to America that the media are already selectively reporting on to leave out the more inconvenient portions. You see, there is no political upside for the media to reveal the politics of this suspected madman.

What is being reported as Mr. Dorner’s manifesto not only endorses Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and vigorously defends Barack Obama and the Democrats’ current gun control push; he also savages the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre while expressing all kinds of love for some of the biggest stars in the left-wing media — by name.

No Tea Partier is this suspected mass murderer, who just might be politically motivated:

Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley, and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite’s lead. I hold many of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings. …

Willie Geist, you’re a talented and charismatic journalist.

Mr. Dorner also seems to have a soft spot for those the media tells us are “safe” Republicans to like, such as George H. W. Bush and Chris Christie, “the only person I would like to see in the White House in 2016 other than Hillary.”

When it comes to defending Obama, Dorner sounds like he’s been watching an awful lot of NBC News:

You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents.

Mr. Dorner’s gun control views make it sound as though much of his thinking has been affected by CNN. In a paragraph that mentions Sandy Hook, Dorner writes:

If you had a well regulated AWB, this would not happen. The time is now to reinstitute a ban that will save lives. Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? This is the same small arms weapons system utilized in eradicating Al Qaeda, Taliban, and every enemy combatant since the Vietnam war. Don’t give me that crap that its not a select fire or full auto rifle like the DoD uses. That’s bullshit because troops who carry the M-4/M-16 weapon system for combat ops outside the wire rarely utilize the select fire function when in contact with enemy combatants.

Those sound just like Piers Morgan’s talking points, no? Well, surprise-surprise, Dornan agrees 100% with Morgan on gun control, though he does worry that Morgan is hurting the cause:

Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws[.]

The manifesto is thousands of word long and mentions dozens of people and topics. But politically, the manifesto is pretty clear.

Which is why the media will downplay it with the same amount of energy they put into amplifying their lies.

So big that two of the media’s most shameful and shameless gun control advocates — Joe Scarborough and Piers Morgan — have finally conceded that arguments made by pro-Second Amendment activists against the expanding of background checks might not be so ridiculous.

In a roundtable discussion on Friday’s “Morning Joe,” Scarborough said that because of the IRS scandal, “My argument is less persuasive today because of these scandals.” He added: “People say, ‘Hey, if they do this with the IRS, asking people what books you read, then how can I trust them with information about my Second Amendment rights?'”

Mika agreed completely: “That is a really, really good point.” Even the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein agreed.

Andrew Johnson at NRO grabbed the video:

Scarborough added that, when it comes to both background checks and immigration reform, the IRS scandal is “devastating,” because both of those pieces of legislation ask us to trust the kind of government that would seize the media’s phone records and use the IRS to target a president’s political foes.

Also courtesy of NRO, here is no-less than Piers Morgan conceding he was wrong to ridicule gun-rights activists (including our own Ben Shapiro) for making the argument that a legitimate fear of government tyranny is what makes the Second Amendment so crucial:

Though I was appalled by the media’s relentless and shameless push last month to pass the Toomey-Manchin bill that would have tightened background checks, I did support its passage, and said so many times while criticizing the media for their disgusting behavior. But this chilling reminder of how corrupt the federal government is has changed my mind completely.

Moreover, our government is not only corrupt, it is vigorously protected by a media that is just as corrupt (NEVER forget the media ignored, dismissed, and even defended the IRS targeting conservatives). The government and media can scream all they want that background checks won’t be used to create a backdoor registry…

But the government and media are liars.

http://news.yahoo.com/disagreements-fast-furious-negotiations-163806591--politics.html,,[],Disagreements on Fast and Furious negotiations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department and a congressional committee disagree on the pace of their talks to settle a lawsuit over congressional efforts to get records related to Operation Fast and Furious, a bungled gun-tracking operation.

In a joint filing Friday night, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee told the judge in the case that a settlement offer it received from the Justice Department this week was a ""grave disappointment"" and that a settlement is not possible.

""The parties are very, very far apart,"" lawyers for the GOP-led committee wrote. ""Indeed, they are not even conceptually on the same page. After nearly four months of negotiating in good faith, the committee reluctantly has concluded — principally as a result of the department's settlement document — that the attorney general is not serious about settlement."" The committee added that it didn't think court-ordered mediation would help.

President Barack Obama has invoked executive privilege and Attorney General Eric Holder has been found in contempt of the House for refusing to turn over records that might explain what led the Justice Department to reverse course, after initially denying to Congress that federal agents had used a controversial tactic called gun-walking in the failed law enforcement operation.

The department has already turned over 7,600 pages of documents on the operation itself. The continuing dispute is over documents describing how the department responded to the congressional investigation of the operation.

In the same filing Friday, the Justice Department said it disagreed with the committee's characterization of the settlement negotiations and that a settlement is still possible.

Without getting into specifics, the department said it ""provided a meaningful offer to the committee to produce documents directly responsive to the committee's identified outstanding interests."" The department added that mediation by a judge would be helpful.

Story continues

""Mediation would provide the parties a forum within which to frankly and confidentially present their respective positions before a neutral third party, who could then offer assistance on how to bridge the differences remaining between the parties,"" the department wrote.

In a January court filing, the Justice Department had reported progress in settlement talks, prompting U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to postpone a hearing that had been scheduled for the following week. That hearing is scheduled to take place next month.

Since that filing, Holder told ABC News that the contempt voted didn't bother him.

""But I have to tell you that for me to really be affected by what happened, I'd have to have respect for the people who voted in that way,"" Holder said in the interview last month. ""And I didn't, so it didn't have that huge an impact on me.""

In a footnote in Friday's filing, the committee wrote that ""recent public statements by the attorney general also suggest that he is not interested in compromise,"" citing the ABC News interview.

Fast and Furious was a flawed gun-tracking investigation focused on Phoenix-area gun shops by the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Agents lost track of about 1,400 guns, and two guns in Operation Fast and Furious were found on the U.S. side of the border at the scene of a shooting in which U.S. border agent Brian Terry was killed.

____

ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA

COLORADO, MAINE AND WASHINGTON: Colorado pot stores open Jan. 1 as retailers usher in the nation's first legal recreational pot industry. Sales in Washington, which also legalized recreational marijuana, are expected to start later in the year. The laws still fly in the face of federal drug rules, but the federal government has said it's not going to fight to shut down pot shops for now. A law legalizing recreational marijuana went into effect in early December in Portland, Maine, but it's largely symbolic because the state has said it will continue to enforce its own ban.

ILLINOIS: It becomes the 20th state to legalize medical marijuana in a pilot project with some of the strictest standards in the nation. However, it may take more than a year to actually buy marijuana as separate state agencies draft rules that must be approved by a legislative committee.

WISCONSIN: Towns and cities may legalize pedal pubs, multiple-person bicycles that ferry riders to and from taverns. A driver steers while multiple riders sit at a bar mounted behind him, each with his or her own pedal-and-chain assembly.

___

TRANSGENDER RIGHTS

CALIFORNIA: It becomes the first state to give specific rights to transgender students starting in January unless opponents show they have gathered enough petition signatures to put a referendum before voters seeking to overturn the law. It lets transgender students choose which restroom to use and whether to play on boys' or girls' sports teams. Critics say that violates the privacy of other students.

___

GUNS

CONNECTICUT: Guns that are considered assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines that haven't been registered with Connecticut authorities will be considered illegal contraband as of Jan. 1. The law was passed in April in response to the massacre that left 26 people dead at Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Story continues

NEW YORK: The state's new gun law, passed shortly after the Sandy Hook shooting, already banned high-capacity magazines and the purchase or sale of popular AR-15 semi-automatic rifles. By April 15, it will also require registration of weapons now classified as assault weapons by owners who previously bought them legally.

___

PAPARAZZI

CALIFORNIA: Photographers who harass celebrities and their children face tougher penalties under a law backed by actresses Halle Berry and Jennifer Garner, who testified in favor of it. Berry told lawmakers her daughter has been intimidated by aggressive photographers who follow them daily. Those who take photos and video of a child without consent and in a harassing manner could face up to a year in county jail and a fine of up to $10,000. They also can be sued for damages and attorney's fees under the new law, which media organizations opposed. Supporters say it also will help protect the children of police officers, judges and others who might be targets because of their parents' occupations.

___

IMMIGRATION

NEVADA: Immigrants living in the United States without legal permission can apply for driver authorization cards starting Jan. 2. State officials anticipate tens of thousands of people will apply under the program.

MARYLAND: In a program similar to Nevada's, immigrants living in the U.S. illegally will be able to obtain a state driver's license or identification card if they can provide evidence of a filed state income tax return or were claimed as a dependent for each of the preceding two years.

___

HEALTH COSTS

MAINE: Health care providers will have to provide patients who request it a list of prices of the most common health services and procedures, a law designed to boost transparency around medical costs.

DELAWARE: The state will limit patient copays for ""specialty tier"" prescription drugs to $150 a month for up to a 30-day supply.

___

WORKING AND WAGES

OHIO: The minimum wage for untipped employees rises from $7.85 to $7.95 an hour, while tipped employees will go from $3.93 to $3.98 an hour, plus tips.

CALIFORNIA: The minimum wage is being boosted to $9 an hour starting in July, the first of two dollar-an-hour boosts that will push the base minimum wage to $10 by 2016, making it one of the nation's highest minimums. Under another bill, domestic workers will have to be paid time and a half if they work more than nine hours in a day or more than 45 hours in a week; baby sitters are exempt."

Not even articles breathlessly titled and subtitled:

Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.

Not even articles that read:

The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat. …

Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition’s most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray.

Slate is what it is and some bloodthirsty Slate writer orgasmic over the prospect of Obama permanently pulverizing and destroying the GOP is as noteworthy as green on grass.

Oh, except after someone like Brit Hume connects the dots.

The author of this outrageous left-wing fever dream is John Dickerson, whom Slate describes as “Slate’s chief political correspondent”. What Slate leaves out of its little bio, though, is that Dickerson is also the political director at CBS News.

Dickerson is merely being Dickerson, and there’s no doubt he speaks for legions upon legions of those in the media today.

What is worthy of note, though, is that a CBS News’ political director is now comfortable openly calling for the destruction of the Republican Party. He obviously fears no admonitions from his colleagues or his employer. And why should he? Earlier this week, Bob Schieffer, a CBS News “living legend,” was perfectly comfortable publicly comparing the NRA to Nazis.

You lump all of this with CNN chief Jeff Zucker applauding Piers Morgan’s shameless feasting off the dead children of Sandy Hook for ratings and attention, and what you have is a media that’s finally … coming out.

And yet, even as they do, even as they openly celebrate their left-wing biases out of one side of their mouth, out the other, they will claim they remain objective and unbiased.

The Big Lie has officially arrived.

And somewhere Dan Rather’s thinking, “Oh, so now it’s okay!?”

http://news.yahoo.com/jersey-sen-lautenberg-dead-age-89-135834018.html,,[],New Jersey Sen. Lautenberg dead at age 89,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The next time a flight attendant reminds you there's no smoking on the plane or you witness a teenager getting carded at a liquor store, think of Frank Lautenberg.

The Democratic senator from New Jersey left his mark on the everyday lives of millions of Americans, whether they know it or not. In the 1980s, he was a driving force behind the laws that banned smoking on most U.S. flights and made 21 the drinking age in all 50 states.

Lautenberg, a multimillionaire businessman who became an accomplished — if often underestimated — politician, died after 4 a.m. EDT on Monday at a New York hospital after suffering complications from viral pneumonia.

At 89, he had been the oldest person in the Senate and the last remaining World War II veteran.

He served nearly three decades in the Senate in two stints, beginning with an upset victory in 1982 over Republican Rep. Millicent Fenwick, the pipe-smoking, pearl-wearing patrician who was the model for the cartoon character Lacey Davenport in ""Doonesbury.""

Possessed with neither a dynamic speaking style nor a telegenic face, he won his last race in 2008 at age 84, becoming the first New Jersey person ever elected to five Senate terms.

""People don't give a darn about my age,"" Lautenberg said then. ""They know I'm vigorous. They know I've got plenty of energy.""

Over the years, Lautenberg worked to secure hundreds of millions of dollars for mass transit projects in New Jersey and became an ardent defender of Amtrak.

He was the author of a 1984 law that threatened to withhold federal highway money from states that did not adopt a drinking age of 21, a measure that passed amid rising alarm over drunken driving. At the time, some states allowed people as young as 18 drink.

By 1988, every state was in compliance with the law, which has been widely credited with reducing highway deaths.

A former smoker, Lautenberg was one of two prime sponsors of the 1989 law that banned smoking on all domestic flights of less than six hours, one of several anti-smoking laws he championed and one that helped pave the way for today's numerous restrictions on where people can light up.

Story continues

Lautenberg had announced in February that he would not seek a sixth term. A longtime advocate of gun control, he returned to the Senate in April despite being in poor health for several votes on gun legislation favored by President Barack Obama, most Democrats and a handful of Republicans. He voted in favor of enhanced background checks for gun purchases and to reinstate a ban on assault-style weapons. Both measures failed.

Wheelchair-bound, he received warm greetings from several colleagues on the Senate floor. He also voted to move along the nomination of a new EPA commissioner, Gina McCarthy.

""Frank was a passionate public servant who was not afraid to fight and vote for what he believed in. He loved the Senate,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. ""He retired once but service called him back, and until the very end of his life, Frank made the trip from New Jersey to D.C. to fight for the issues he believed in and the people he represented. He gave everything he had to public service.""

Republican Gov. Chris Christie, whom the Democrat Lautenberg frequently criticized, will appoint a successor and a special election will determine a replacement. Newark Mayor Cory Booker had announced his intention to run and had raised some $2 million.

Along with Lautenberg's legislative accomplishments, he had a string of electoral coups, including his upset over Fenwick, whom he called ""the most popular candidate in the country,"" and a victory in a strange, abbreviated, back-from-retirement campaign 20 years later.

He initially retired in 2000 after 18 years in the Senate, saying he did not have the drive to raise money for a fourth campaign. He served on the boards of three companies, two graduate schools and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

But New Jersey Democrats recruited Lautenberg out of retirement in September 2002 as an 11th-hour replacement for Robert Torricelli, Lautenberg's longtime rival, who had abandoned his re-election bid just five weeks before Election Day.

Republicans went to court to prevent what they called the Democratic Party's ballot ""switcheroo."" When that failed, they attacked Lautenberg as a political relic ill-suited for dangerous times.

But Lautenberg surged to an easy win over Republican Douglas Forrester and returned to the Senate in 2003 at age 78, resuming his role as a leading liberal, and he made it clear that his return to office was no mere cameo.

When the Democrats regained a Senate majority in 2007, he returned to the powerful Appropriations Committee, on which he had served for 15 years. Then, in the fall of 2008, he beat back a Democratic primary challenge.

He was back in the headlines in December that year — this time as an apparent victim.

After Wall Street money manager Bernard Madoff was accused of running a $50 billion fraud scheme, Lautenberg's family foundation said the bulk of its investments were managed by him. A lawyer for the foundation declined to discuss the amount of any possible losses, but tax records in 2006 indicated Madoff managed more than 90 percent of the foundation's nearly $14 million in assets.

Lautenberg first gained prominence as chairman and CEO of Automatic Data Processing, a New Jersey-based payroll services company he had founded with two friends in 1952. It became one of the largest such companies in the world.

He was first elected to the Senate in 1982, during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Working his way up the seniority ladder, Lautenberg managed to carve out influence on the environment and transportation, two issues that matter greatly to New Jersey, the nation's most densely populated state.

Before Republicans won control of the Senate in the 1994 elections, Lautenberg was chairman of key subcommittees responsible for transportation appropriations and the Superfund pollution cleanup program. He became the ranking Democrat on those panels after 1994.

From those posts, he worked to secure hundreds of millions of dollars for mass transit projects in the state, which he said would reduce pollution and traffic congestion. He also was a leading defender of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail system.

In 1984, as a novice lawmaker and member of the minority chamber in the Senate, Lautenberg wrote a bill to withhold federal highway funds from states that did not set 21 as a minimum age to buy and possess alcohol.

After the federal voting age was lowered to 18 in 1971, many states followed suit by setting minimum drinking ages at 18 to 20.

By the early 1980s, the problem of drunken driving by teenagers was getting widespread attention. Reagan signed the bill, and by 1988, every state had a legal drinking age of 21.

Lautenberg often attacked tobacco companies' advertising tactics. During a 1989 debate over smoking, when tobacco-state lawmakers asked what would become of tobacco farmers, Lautenberg scoffed, ""Grow soybeans or something.""

Another frequent target was the gun industry. ""Common sense tells you that there are more than enough dangerous weapons on the streets,"" said Lautenberg, who sponsored numerous gun-control measures, a few of which were enacted.

He also spent much of his political career pushing for funding for Superfund, a program that pays for cleanup of environmentally hazardous sites.

Lautenberg was a reliable vote for traditional Democratic policies, though he bucked President Bill Clinton in 1993 on the budget because he said it raised taxes and didn't cut spending enough. He also voted against Clinton on the North American Free Trade Agreement, opposed by the staunch labor allies Lautenberg had come to depend on.

Later in his career, he became a foil for Christie.

In 2012, Christie called Lautenberg a ""partisan hack"" and an ""embarrassment"" and said it was time for him to retire. Lautenberg called Christie ""the name-calling governor"" and, in one speech, ""the king of liars.""

Lautenberg had health problems in recent years. He had the flu and missed the Senate's Jan. 1 vote to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff of rising taxes and falling government spending, then missed several votes two months later because of leg pain. A chest cold kept him from attending a May 29 tribute in New York honoring him for his contributions to the Jewish community and Israel.

He had been diagnosed in February 2010 with B-cell lymphoma of the stomach and underwent chemotherapy treatments until he was declared in June 2010 to be free of cancer. He worked between the treatments.

The diagnosis came just days after the death of Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, making Lautenberg the oldest member of the Senate.

For his first 14 years in the Senate, he was often in the shadow of New Jersey's other, better known senator, Bill Bradley, a former pro basketball player and 2000 presidential candidate. But he proved a formidable and bruising foe.

Running for an open Senate seat in 1982, Lautenberg won 51 percent of the vote against Fenwick. The win, financed largely with $3 million of Lautenberg's own fortune, was a shocker.

Fenwick was 72 when Lautenberg questioned her capacity to serve in the Senate. On the campaign trail, he criticized her ""capability"" to be a senator, but some observers seemed to think he was going after her age — a fact that was noted 26 years later when he ran for re-election at age 84.

""It's hard when your own words come back to haunt you, isn't it, Mr. Lautenberg?"" said an ad for his Democratic primary opponent, U.S. Rep. Robert Andrews, whom he defeated handily before beating former U.S. Rep. Dick Zimmer in the general election.

After Lautenberg won the 1982 election, Nicholas Brady, who had been appointed to serve the remainder of the previous term, resigned early to give Lautenberg valuable seniority over other new senators. He was sworn in Dec. 27, 1982, by a federal judge from Denver while he was vacationing in Vail, Colo.

In 1988, Lautenberg faced Pete Dawkins, a handsome Heisman Trophy winner who attended the U.S. Military Academy and went on to become a brigadier general and successful executive. Lautenberg's campaign assailed Dawkins as an out-of-touch carpetbagger and ran ads urging Dawkins, ""Be Real, Pete."" Lautenberg won with 54 percent of the vote.

He won a third term in 1994 against Republican Garabed ""Chuck"" Haytaian, despite the GOP gains nationwide that overturned Democratic majorities in the Senate and House and Haytaian's criticism of Lautenberg as a ""silent senator.""

In his unusual five-week return to campaigning in 2002, Lautenberg persevered with a steady, risk-averse campaign that portrayed him as a ""serious senator"" for ""serious times"" a year after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Republicans focused on Lautenberg's liberal voting record, notably his opposition to the death penalty, development of a missile defense system and the 1991 resolution authorizing force against Iraq.

Born in urban Paterson, N.J., the son of Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants, Lautenberg never forgot his roots. He often recounted what government did for him — and what it could have done to help his widowed mother as she struggled to pay his father's medical bills.

""We want to help. That's government's role,"" Lautenberg said during his successful bid for re-election in 1994.

He was educated at Nutley High School and served in the Army Signal Corps during World War II. With the help of the G.I. bill, he received an undergraduate degree in economics from Columbia University.

Lautenberg, who lived in Cliffside Park, N.J., is survived by his wife, Bonnie, and four children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1988.

In his press release announcing passage, the Governor “likened Senate Sub. for House Bill 2117 to a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.” This “shot of adrenaline” included a Kansas Legislative Research Department estimated $2.4 billion budget deficit by the beginning of fiscal year 2015. It was not clear how a deficit of almost 20% of a $13 billion state budget (PDF) is fiscally conservative, financially responsible or in any other way aligned with Republican principles of prudent management. The narrow passage prompted the Governor and his conservative allies to successfully purge moderate Republicans in favor of a more conservative class of legislators willing to be less thoughtful about the lawmaking entrusted to them.

So now that fiscal matters are in order, in what type of business-friendly environment do Kansans now live, work and play?

The legislature is now in the midst of a fight with the Kansas Supreme Court over what the Court has deemed unconstitutionally underfunded public schools.

For those businesses interested in moving to Kansas, the owners can look forward to sending their children to poorly funded schools. These schools may not yet be able to teach creationism or intelligent design, but the state school board is well versed in de-emphasizing the teaching of evolutionary biology, the cornerstone of scientific understanding. Which means that the employees needed by these new Kansas businesses will be at best undereducated if not completely unprepared to work in the 21st century.

This is probably why Education Week ranks Kansas 37th in its 2013 Quality Counts survey, including a D in K-12 achievement and a D+ in teaching performance. These are exactly the qualities any smart business owner seeks for both his or her own kids as well as for the training of his or her employees.

The social environment for new Kansas business owners is not much better. Kansas is home to the well-known Westboro Baptist Church. New business owners, their families and employees can enjoy the sight of the church’s hateful protests at local high school graduation ceremonies in neighboring Lawrence and Eudora.

Lawrence may be familiar to many Americans as the home to the University of Kansas. It is certainly not a place for new business owners to locate. The Kansas “Capitol Commission” recently prayedto restore this “dark spiritual area” of Kansas:



In a one-page list of Capitol Prayers being passed around the Statehouse recently, prayer is urged for a number of Kansas leaders, including Gov. Sam Brownback and his staff, and for those who are ill or facing adversity within the Legislature and state government.

The list also states under the heading Intercessor's Challenge: ""Target prayer for dark spiritual areas of SE Kansas, Lawrence, KCKS, North Johnson County — ask God to restore the land.""

Dave DePue, the Kansas pastor for Capitol Commission, said the prayer was to improve the economies in those areas.

""We just seem to be stalled in getting this economy turned around,"" DePue said, although he added that Lawrence seems to be doing well economically.

Asked about the term ""dark spiritual area,"" he said, ""I don't know whether that is worded right, because Lawrence isn't losing population.""

The list also included a prayer for the judicial system and asking God ""to provide wisdom for restructuring the Kansas selection process.""

Of course there are many other churches besides Westboro Baptist. Proud Kansas gun owners will keep you safe in church, unless they disagree with your politics. Dr. George Tiller was assassinated in his own church in 2009 during Sunday morning services.

For those interested in more peaceful protests of women’s reproductive rights, members of the Wichita community are currently constructing the “National Pro-Life Memorial and National Life Center” in the form of a replica of the Western Wall in Jerusalem. The activists view the Western Wall as the embodiment of remembering Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and now want the wall to memorialize some 60 million aborted fetuses.

Speaking of gun politics, state Representative John Rubin just introduced a bill proclaiming “any personal firearm, accessory or ammunition that is owned or manufactured in Kansas and stays in the state would not be subject to federal law.



Any federal authorities trying to enforce any kind of rule on such a firearm would face possible prison time. It also would prohibit doctors, but not psychiatrists, from asking whether a patient owns a gun…Rubin said the measure would prevent any gun owned or produced in Kansas and remaining in the state from being controlled by ""any past, present or future federal law, rule or regulation of any kind.""

The state Assistant Attorney General kindly pointed out that federal law always supersedes state law and that states do not have the ability to waive federal laws.

The saddest part of this story is that Kansas as it exists outside of conservative politics and social orthodoxy is an incredibly attractive place to live, work and play. The state hosts the intersection of three bi-coastal interstate highways. State electric rates are among the lowest in the country and the electric generation mix is well-diversified (and therefore protected against volatile swings in the price of a single fuel source). The state is a leader in wind energy development.

So, my hope is that a group of business owners take a good look at relocating to Kansas. Then I hope they decide not to come and I hope they announce the reason behind their decision not to come. I hope they stand up and say “there are a lot of reason Kansas was an attractive home for our business. We decided not to come because we don’t think citizens are well cared for. We don’t think they are educated properly to work for our business. We think public safety is seriously threatened by loose gun laws promoted by zealots willing to shoot first and ask no questions later. We are concerned about an adherence to a specific form of religion that dominates public life to the exclusion of any contradictory worldviews. Our business requires open dialogue and disagreement to be successful. This is apparently not encouraged in Kansas. And more than anything, we are concerned that fiscal irresponsibility forces us to locate in a state that provides important protection and quality services to citizens so that our employees show up ready to work. These requirements are not met by the state and we will avoid doing business there until the state is more business friendly.""

That is my hope for the state of Kansas."

On Thursday, the first full trading session since the bill was defeated, gun stocks lagged, and analysts fear this might be part of a wider trend.

In recent months, the fear of new restrictions has driven gun sales to all-time highs. Now, that incentive could be gone.

""When these things happen, we do see demand slide,"" said Neal Dihora of Morningstar, who covers Alliant Techsystems, an aerospace company that also makes guns for the civilian and military markets. ""People start hoarding for a while, and [then they] realize they don't have to fill their basements with ammunition because it will still be there tomorrow.""

Alliant's (ATK) stock price dropped 1.5% Thursday, after seeing its shares surge 38% over the last year. Ammunition maker Olin Corp. (OLN) fell 1.2%, after climbing more than 13% over the last year. Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. (SWHC) managed a 1.7% gain Thursday, while Sturm, Ruger (RGR) slipped 1.5%.

The stock price for Cabela's (CAB), a retailer dependent on gun sales, dropped nearly 5%.

Obama's reelection and the Newtown shooting in December made gun enthusiasts fearful that regulations would be tightened. This prompted consumers to buy military-style semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, the prime targets in the so-called assault rifle ban. Prices jumped sky-high, stock ran out and factories struggled to keep up.

According to the FBI, the 10 top-volume weeks for background checks have occurred since President Obama's reelection. A report published by Scott Hamman, an analyst for Keybanc Capital Markets, said this was a 26% increase from the year before, ""underscoring our belief that current levels of demand are unsustainable over the long term.""

The proposed assault rifle ban ground to a halt Wednesday, when the Senate shot it down, along with a proposed expansion of background checks.

The bill, which was signed into law by President Obama on Wednesday, kept a number of tax breaks for education and low wage earners that many young adults rely on. However, the deal merely put off budget cuts that could hurt key programs like education grants and job training programs.

The so-called sequester, which includes across-the-board slashing of funds to domestic programs, is now slated to start in March.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a letter to Congress that it would cut programs like the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, which allows millions of students to apply for post-secondary student aid. Duncan said that under the sequester, the Education Department may also have to cut contracts with private-sector entities that service federal student loans. This could hurt borrowers once they're out of school.

Though the popular federal Pell Grants for education are safe from the sequester, they aren't protected come 2014 and beyond, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

""This generation is facing rising college costs and high unemployment rates, so those are the kinds of investments we need to make sure we're preserving,"" said Jennifer Mishory, the 27-year-old deputy director of Young Invincibles, an organization that represents the interests of 18 to 34-year-olds.

Programs like Americorps, which provides skills training through community service projects, or Job Corps, which helps people find jobs though training programs, are also expected to take a hit.

Besides the specific budget cuts, young adults are also worried about the quick fixes that Washington has resorted to recently, rather than long-term agreements that would remove uncertainty.

""We're frustrated that this is only a short-term agreement that has set up more of these 'crisis countdown' scenarios in the coming months,"" said Matthew Segal, the 27-year-old founder of OurTime.org, a news website for young adults.

Related: Families keep tax breaks

While many young adults are concerned for what's next, they did not fare as badly as other demographics in terms of tax changes stemming from the fiscal cliff deal.

Congress saved the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which helps defray the cost of higher education, the Earned Income Tax Credit, a benefit for low-income individuals, and the Child Tax Credit, which helps low-income parents pay for education by allowing them to claim up to $1000 per child.

Most tax increases were limited to upper-income earners -- a group that excludes the vast majority young Americans. The median income for people aged 25 to 34 barely topped $30,000 in 2011, according to the U.S. Census.

""We are pleased that the president and both parties in Congress came together to prevent more severe tax increases that could have adversely impacted young Americans,"" said Aaron Smith, executive director of Young Invincibles."

New York City strip club owner Sam Zherka says he was investigated by the IRS in 2010, shortly after calling for a local Tea Party. ""They're investigating every dealing I've done, since the beginning of time,"" Zherka says. He claims the FBI is involved, too, and is suing both agencies.

Rep. Bill Flores suggested to The National Review that he might have been asked for more information about his tax returns because he made inquiries to the IRS on behalf of a Tea Party group in Texas.

Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, told Politico that the IRS asked about his group's political activity because, ""someone in the administration was targeting and attempting to intimidate us.""

Former Libertarian Party candidate Wayne Allyn Root said ""I am the face of Obama’s IRS attacks,"" but as Mother Jones ' Stephanie Mencimer reports, there were probably other reasons Root was audited. Like that in 2007, Root and his wife reported $215,000 in gross income, but had so many write offs that he claimed his taxable income was just $25,000. In 2008, his gross income was $209,000 but his taxable income was $136,000. Root apparently filed a Schedule C, Mencimer reports, and about 25 percent of all Schedule Cs get audited.

The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan made a similar claim, saying Romney donor Frank VanderSloot ""found himself last June, for the first time in 30 years, the target of I.R.S. auditors."" Does that mean VanderSloot was audited in 1982? No doubt he was being persecuted by Ronald Reagan.

As The New York Times' Nate Silver has explained, in 2012, the IRS got 144 million individual income tax returns. It audited just 1 percent — which means 1.5 million of them. That means you'd expect many, many of the people audited to be conservative. It does not mean the IRS was combing Mitt Romney's fundraising disclosures to find conservatives to audit.

According to a Treasury Department inspector general's report, a Cincinnati field office of the IRS improperly targeted conservatives when determining whether they should get tax-exempt status. The law says 501©(4)s must be educational organizations, not political ones. So they created short cuts to find groups that looked like they'd do campaign activity — names with words like ""Tea Party"" and missions involving cutting spending, reducing the debt, things like that. That's really bad! That's a scandal! But it's not evidence of a massive IRS-wide campaign to silence all conservative voters and donors. It's not evidence that the White House was on the phone with the IRS, siccing it on the president's enemies.

But many are looking for that evidence. The Daily Caller analyzed White House visitor logs and found that IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman visited the White House 157 times — far more than any other Cabinet member. Fox News' Brit Hume tweeted, ""What was the ex-IRS chief doing at the White House all those times?"" Bill O'Reilly said it was the ""smoking gun.""

RELATED: Lois Lerner, IRS Scandal Target No. 1, Just Got in Actual Trouble

But The Atlantic's Garance Frank-Ruta destroys that claim. The visitor records only show Shulman was cleared to visit the White House 157 times. A full 76 percent of those planned visits were related to the implementation of Obamacare, including 80 biweekly health reform deputies meetings. The vast majority of these visits were not in the White House proper, but the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and New Executive Office Building instead. And, just because you're cleared to meet at the White House doesn't mean you actually go. ""Indeed, of the 157 events Shulman was cleared to attend, White House records only provide time of arrival information — confirming that he actually went to them — for 11 events over the 2009-2012 period, and time of departure information for only six appointments,"" Franke-Ruta reports.

Of the conservatives who blame their auditing on their politics, McClatchy writes, ""Their collective experiences at a minimum could spread skepticism about the fairness of a powerful agency that should be above reproach and at worst could point to a secret political vendetta within the government against conservatives."" Anyone who's been excessively generous in estimating the cost of their ""home office"" certainly hopes so.

Obama holds last news conference of his first term

The president recently nominated new Treasury and Defense secretaries

Budget issues%2C guns and immigration are among his second term issues

President Obama fielded questions on gun violence, debt reduction, and other aspects of his second term during the last news conference of his first term.

Here are some of the highlights:

12:24 p.m. The last question from the news conference touches on the makeup of Obama's second-term Cabinet and whether he has done enough to socialize with lawmakers. Obama has faced some criticism that his first four high-profile appointments for his second term have all been white men.

Obama said he's ""very proud"" that in his first four years he had one of the most diverse administrations in history. He notes that some of the most important players in shaping his first-term agenda were women -- Hillary Rodham Clinton at State Department, Kathleen Sebelius at Health and Human Services, and Janet Napolitano at Homeland Security.

""People can expect that record will be built on,"" he said. ""I would just suggest that everybody wait to see who (else) is on my White house staff and my Cabinet before rushing to judgment.

""Most people who know me know that I'm a pretty friendly guy. And I like a good party.""

12:20 p.m. Obama says the House GOP probably has the votes to follow through on threats to shut down the government as they grapple with the White House over raising the debt ceiling. But he cautions that it would be a mistake and it would hurt the economy. ""I suspect the American people would blame all of Washington,"" he says. ""If the issue is deficit reduction ... getting our debt in a sustainable place, the Republicans will have a partner in me.""

12:14 p.m. Obama reiterates that he won't negotiate on raising the debt ceiling. He says again that he's willing to have a conversation about ways to reduce the deficit, but the debt ceiling must be raised. ""We've got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again,"" he says.

12:08 p.m. Obama says that he's looking into using executive action to bolster gun control in the aftermath of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting that left 26 dead. He expresses dismay about some gun rights advocates, without naming any particular group. ""Those who oppose any common sense gun control measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear. ... There's probably an economic element to that.""

12:00 p.m. CBS News correspondent Major Garrett notes to Obama that there are often debates on the debt ceiling. As a senator, Obama even once voted against the raising of the debt ceiling. Obama says he won't have a conversation ""every month or every three months conversation about whether or not we pay our bills.""

11:54 p.m. President Obama invokes twice that the USA is ""not a deadbeat nation"" as he calls for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. ""The issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation."" He makes the case that Congress should pay for services that have been rendered. ""This is not a a complicated concept. ... You don't go out to dinner and eat all you want and then leave without paying the check.""

11:47 p.m. Obama's first question is on gun control. The AP's Julie Pace asks about the probability of passing an assault weapons ban. Obama calls on Congress to ""examine their own conscience.""

11:44 a.m. Obama turns his focus to to his call on Congress to raise the debt ceiling. Not rising it would be a ""self-inflicted wound on the economy."" He adds, ""To even entertain the idea (of not raising the debt ceiling), it's absurd."" Obama lays down a marker for GOP lawmakers on the debt limit. ""They will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy.""

11:39 a.m. President Obama starts the news conference by declaring, ""We are poised for a good year."" He also makes a case that his administration has made a good start toward deficit reduction. He reiterates that he's open to making modest adjustments to Medicare and other entitlements, but we also need more revenue. Americans wants Washington to get our books in order in ""a balanced way."""

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/01/gun-control-immigration-reform-fiscal-issues-emerge-as-top-issues-for-new/,2013-01-01 00:00:00,['Joseph Weber'],"Guns, immigration, fiscal issues emerge as top priorities for Obama, new Congress","After an election year in which legislative business practically ground to a halt, Congress is poised to make up for lost time in 2013.

The new Congress will begin its next session with an agenda expected to focus largely on issues that re-emerged over the past several weeks and months, with gun legislation and immigration reform near the top.

Though fiscal issues will remain a priority, how much work lawmakers put into them depends on whether, or to what extent, President Obama and congressional Republicans resolve the fiscal crisis in the closing days of this session.

A basic deal to prevent some of the $600 billion mix of tax increases and automatic spending cuts from kicking in Jan. 1 would still leave the 113th Congress to address debt ceiling and tax code issues.

But in the near term, immigration legislation appears to be high on the docket in the next Congress and second Obama administration term.

Washington has tried for years to change the country's immigration policy -- to strengthen border security and stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S.; to reform the visa system for the benefit of those legal immigrants following the rules; and figure out how to address the millions of illegal immigrants already here.

Legislative efforts by Democrats and Republicans on comprehensive immigration reform had reached a standstill -- until the issue re-emerged during this election cycle when Obama suspended deportation for many young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.

Republicans have since signaled their intentions to be the first to introduce and pass more comprehensive legislation to deal with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, especially after Obama won re-election with roughly 71 percent of the Hispanic vote.

However, Obama appeared to re-stake his turf Sunday, saying he would introduce legislation next year to fix “our broken immigration system.”

Danielle Doane, director of government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, said the question about what will be on the new Congress' agenda is really two basic questions: “What will be their priorities and what will they be forced to deal with?""

Gun control could answer both of those questions. Obama and leaders of the Democrat-controlled Senate have made clear their intentions to promptly introduce legislation restricting firearms, in the aftermath of the Dec. 14 shooting at a Connecticut elementary school in which six adults and 20 first-graders were killed.

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats want to re-institute an assault-weapons ban – a plan Obama on Sunday again publicly supported. And related legislation could include proposed bans on high-capacity ammunition clips and tighter background checks for gun buyers.

Lawmakers have suggested over the past weeks that debates on gun control could start as early as this month and delay those on immigration reform until spring – given the political climate and the Senate Judiciary Committee having oversight on both issues.

However, Democrats can expect strong opposition from Republicans and the National Rifle Association, the country’s most influential gun lobby. And large-scale Second Amendment changes are not expected, even if Democrats pass legislation.

The president on Sunday said energy issues are also on his high-priority list, specifically how the country can produce more energy in environmentally conscious ways, and mentioned 15 times in an interview with NBC News the need for further deficit reduction.

Congressional leaders appeared reluctant over the lame duck session to say what will be their top priorities.

A spokesman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, whose office plays a major role in setting the agenda, said lawmakers were focused on solving the fiscal crisis.

Senate leadership did not return calls, nor did the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank influential in setting Democratic legislative policy.

However, Doane thinks the Republican-controlled House will again focus on budget-related issues.

""We'll likely see debt and deficit issues weaving throughout next year,"" she said.

The recent fiscal negotiations failed to include cuts to such major entitlement programs as Medicare and Social Security – an issue fiscal conservative are expected to revisit.

And even if Congress extends the so-called ""Bush-era"" tax rates, that still leaves members trying to overhaul the U.S. tax code.

""There's a lot of stuff wrapped into the extensions alone,"" Doane said.

The fiscal talks also failed to address the recurring debt ceiling issue.

A deal in Congress in the summer of 2011 raised the ceiling and narrowly averted the U.S. from defaulting on its debt. But just last week, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the country is again approaching its debt limit and would likely default without congressional action in the next couple of months.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told “Fox News Sunday” he would not vote to raise the ceiling if entitlement reform was left out of the deal.

“Why would I raise the debt ceiling again unless we address what put us in debt to begin with?” he asked. “I’m not going to raise the debt ceiling unless we get serious about keeping the country from becoming Greece, saving Social Security and Medicare.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/14/obama-again-warns-congressional-republicans-will-not-negotiation-on-debt/,2013-01-14 00:00:00,[],"Obama: No haggling on debt ceiling, can use executive action to tighten gun laws","President Obama on Monday warned congressional Republicans again that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling, saying Washington must increase the limit to pay its bills and that such brinksmanship would be “absurd” and “irresponsible.”

“The issue here is whether Washington will pay its bills,” Obama said in the final press conference of his first term. “We are not a deadbeat nation.”

The president’s comments opened the roughly 30-minute White House question-and-answer session with reporters that focused largely on the debt ceiling and Obama’s gun-control plans in the aftermath of last month’s mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in which 26 were killed.

Obama, who vowed following the Dec. 14 massacre to curb gun violence, repeated his promise.

“If there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step,” said the president, who is expected to get strong opposition from gun rights groups should he submit legislation to Congress, as expected.

Obama also suggested such groups are publicizing what appears to be strong turnouts at gun shows as “an effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government is about to take all of your guns.”

Andrew Arulanandam, a National Rifle Association spokesman said, “The president should go talk to the people buying firearms and ask them why they're buying firearms.""

Obama also said some of his proposed changes will require legislation and some of them can be accomplished through executive action.

The president used the press conference to attempt to frame the debt limit issue to the American public as one about the perils of not paying past debts – not about future spending.

“Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending,” he said. “These are bills that have already been racked up.”

Republicans leaders responded by saying the debit limit debate is connected to spending, suggesting another round of intense negotiations when Congress returns later this month.

""The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time,” said House Speaker John Boehner. “The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation's obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same.""

Boehner's remarks were in sharp contrast to those of Obama, who said near the start of the press conference that he won re-election on his plan, which separates the debt ceiling from talks about reducing the U.S. deficit through spending cuts and increasing tax revenue through closing loopholes.

Obama argued he has already reduced federal spending by $1.2 trillion over the past two years but remains willing to talk about more cuts, including some to Medicare.

Still, the president acknowledged the Republican-controlled House likely has enough votes to demand spending cuts be part of the debate, which would result in no increase to the debt limit and the county defaulting on its bills.

The House nearly did that in summer 2011.

The chamber returns to negotiate with the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House on three fiscal matters with looming deadlines: the debt ceiling, massive federal spending cuts known as sequester and a budget resolution.

The talks resume because Washington again failed after the November elections to reach a long-term solution to the country’s debt and deficit issues.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Obama and his allies need to get serious about spending and that the debt limit debate is “the perfect time for it.”

The Kentucky senator also called the county’s debt and deficit a “huge, huge problem.""

On a question about Obama nominating only men to his Cabinet for his second term, the president told critics to wait until his selections are complete “before they rush to justice.”"

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/26/cause-for-concern-will-un-arms-trade-treaty-trample-on-us-gun-rights/,2013-09-26 00:00:00,[],Gun registry 'scheme' among concerns over UN arms treaty,"Secretary of State John Kerry signed an international treaty on arms regulation Wednesday, angering conservative lawmakers and rattling the National Rifle Association despite claims that the treaty won't infringe on gun rights.

So what's all the fuss about?

The treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, would regulate the $70 billion global trade in conventional arms. The U.S. is the largest arms exporter in the world, and Kerry's signature was seen as a significant step in pushing it forward.

Supporters say the treaty sends a bold global message advocating the first-ever moral standards on the cross-border trade linked to human rights violations around the world. But to some on U.S. soil, the treaty treads into dangerous territory and could step on the constitutional rights of Americans.

They point in part to language, at the very beginning of the document, that includes ""small arms and light weapons"" and worry this could cover firearms owned by Americans.

According to the treaty, the international sale of weapons would be linked to the human rights records of buyers; it requires the countries that sign on to establish regulations for selling weapons. This has raised concern that the treaty could be used as an excuse to push new gun laws.

But the treaty also advocates keeping data of arms purchases, which the NRA and other groups say could be used as an international log to keep tabs on gun owners.

The record-keeping section in the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) encourages members to ""maintain records of conventional arms covered under Article 2,"" which include battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, warships and small arms and light weapons.

Further, those records should be kept for a minimum of 10 years, the treaty states -- which NRA leader Wayne LaPierre has referred to as ""nothing more than gun registration by a different name.""

Because the treaty's language is so broad, LaPierre has said that ""manufacturers of civilian shotguns would have to comply with the same regulatory process as a manufacturer of military attack helicopters.""

Chris Cox, the executive director for the group's Institute for Legislative Action, says the treaty ""threatens individual firearm ownership with an invasive registration scheme.""

The treaty also calls for potential arms deals to be evaluated on whether the buyer would be able to carry out crimes against humanity or other war crimes, including genocide. It also prohibits the export of conventional arms if they can be used in attacks on civilians or civilian buildings such as schools and hospitals.

What it doesn't do is regulate the domestic sale of weapons in any country. And Kerry said Wednesday: ""This treaty will not diminish anyone's freedom. In fact, the treaty recognizes the freedom of both individuals and states to obtain, possess, and use arms for legitimate purposes.""

Even though the ATT was created to monitor the global arms trade and essentially shame countries into revealing alliances by making them document who they sold weapons to, there is no clear-cut punishment for those who don't.

There are many parts of the treaty that are also open to interpretation. For example, the international pact contains no language on how to handle countries who loan or gift weapons to others.

Part of the concern with the treaty, among critics, is its vagueness.

In April, the U.N. General Assembly voted to approve the ATT 154-3. Those voting in favor included the U.S., Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

Twenty-three countries abstained from voting, including China and Russia. Several others said the human rights criteria in the treaty was too vague.

Iran, North Korea and Syria voted against the treaty.

Fifty countries need to ratify the treaty for it to enter into force. So far, only six have and the likelihood of it being approved by the U.S. Senate is slim. It takes two-thirds of the 100 lawmakers in the Senate to win ratification.

The domestic battle heating up over the treaty is what is likely to give the Obama administration the most trouble.

In a letter to President Obama, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the treaty raised significant legislative questions and warned the Obama administration against taking any action to implement the treaty without the Senate's advice or consent.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was among 35 senators who earlier this year co-sponsored a resolution expressing concerns about the dangers of the treaty and how it might infringe the constitutional rights of Americans.

""I'd like to see the U.N. try to send inspectors to the Texas State Rifle Association's annual gathering,"" he said in a statement after Kerry signed the treaty. ""Law-abiding Texans who are in the market for an imported shotgun, pistol, or rifle out to be very concerned by the administration's move today."""

http://news.yahoo.com/despite-hot-issues-lawmakers-meet-public-less-114445257.html,,[],"Despite hot issues, lawmakers meet public less","FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) — From her front row seat at the Fort Dodge Public Library, pugnacious retiree Betty Nostrom wasted no time grilling the U.S. senator standing before 80 constituents over how he was investigating the deaths of four Americans in Libya last fall.

""Or will that just be swept under the rug?"" Nostrom asked Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, kicking off an hour of polite, though pointed, questioning.

Farmers, nurses and veterans took turns pressing Grassley on gun control, immigration, the deficit and the Internal Revenue Service scandal, and listening to his answers.

Some in the audience applauded. Others scoffed. But all embraced the chance to put their representative to Washington on the spot, face to face, during the town hall style meeting, a staple of American civics that's growing increasingly scarce.

These days, lawmakers generally are holding fewer in-person public gatherings with constituents than they have in past years, evidenced by the smattering of such events last week during the Memorial Day congressional recess. Instead, members of Congress are relying far more on telephone and online forums, according to watchdog groups, political organizations and lawmakers themselves.

""There's a myth out there that legislators aren't listening,"" said Brad Fitch, president of the Congressional Management Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit group that advocates best practices for members of Congress. ""They are, but we're seeing them shift to other forums, and the discussions often aren't as robust.""

Why the shift? For one, angry crowds, sometimes in the thousands, mobbed public question-and-answer meetings in lawmakers' home states during the raucous debate over health care legislation in 2009. Then there was the shooting rampage in 2011 at a public appearance in Tucson by then-Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz.

Such incidents spooked lawmakers, who also were facing constituents deeply down on Washington and frustrated by high unemployment and foreclosure rates.

Story continues

Beyond any security concerns, politicians have practical reasons for changing to a more frequent electronic format. Many say those numerous benefits of outweigh the big drawback: They lose the personal touch, the handshake moment at the end of a robust discussion, that can tighten bonds with their constituents.

Some lawmakers say electronic versions of town halls are more efficient and convenient than the real thing.

Rep. Jim Gerlach, R-Penn., says he can check in with voters at home without having to travel back, often holding constituent conference calls on Mondays or Tuesdays when Congress is in session.

It's not just convenient for a lawmaker to arrange. They pay a service to simultaneously call thousands of numbers and ask them to stay on the line for the event to begin. It's also convenient for constituents to participate. They don't have to take off of work or get in a car, and they can linger and listen as long as they like.

In an era of shrinking congressional office budgets, advocates say electronic forums also are appealing because they reach many times more people and are cheap to advertise via a single email sent to thousands.

About 20 people showed up for Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney's meeting in Union, S.C., last week. Mulvaney recalled once advertising a meeting by paying for 1,800 first-class mail notices. He said four people showed up.

Lawmakers more conveniently can collect the contact information from participants in the electronic forums than the in-person kind.

In Fort Dodge, a Grassley aide passed around paper cards for the 80 attendees to fill out return after the meeting for staff to record.

Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said he once held a call that attracted 50,000 listeners, and he uses the conference calls to conduct opinion polls.

""It gives us a real pulse,"" Franks said. ""In my judgment it's just a wonderful way to go.""

At the same time, electronic town hall meetings decrease the risk of ugly confrontations that can be caught on video and posted on YouTube.

Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., said opponents or interest groups sometimes hijack public events and heckle the members. With teleconferences, they are easier to weed out, Boustany said.

The convenience of picking up the phone may make it easier for people to participate in an era when busy schedules and perhaps apathy or disgust with Congress may keep voters from engaging in a nation where fewer than 1 in 5 people approves of the job Congress is doing.

All this means the odds are that most people in the U.S. won't get the chance to interrogate their lawmakers in person during Congress' summer break, despite a series of hot issues on Capitol Hill, including immigration, the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, the IRS' targeting of conservative political groups and the Justice Department's seizure of media outlets' telephone records.

""You have all this and members of Congress have effectively stopped doing town hall meetings,"" says Matt Kibbe, president of the tea-party organizer Freedomworks. ""I find quite remarkable that they are unwilling to meet with their customers.""

Grassley is a big exception.

He's diligently continued holding frequent in-person town hall meetings, annually meeting his promise to visit each of Iowa's 99 counties despite being the target of angry conservatives in 2009 during the health care debate and despite the logistical challenges.

Grassley insisted there's still value in the traditional way, calling the give-and-take with constituents the glue that binds him to them.

""I can read their letters and talk to them on the phone. But you don't fully understand,"" he said last Wednesday. ""Here, I look them in the eye. They look me in the eye. It's more full communication.""

With that, he headed out the Fort Dodge library door, headed to his fourth town hall of the day. And it was only 1 p.m.

Obama: The fall

By Charles Krauthammer,

Fate is fickle, power cyclical, and nothing is new under the sun. Especially in Washington, where after every election the losing party is sagely instructed to confess sin, rend garments and rethink its principles lest it go the way of the Whigs. And where the victor is hailed as the new Caesar, facing an open road to domination.

And where Barack Obama, already naturally inclined to believe his own loftiness, graciously accepted the kingly crown and proceeded to ride his reelection success to a crushing victory over the GOP at the fiscal cliff, leaving a humiliated John Boehner & Co. with nothing but naked tax hikes.

Thus emboldened, Obama turned his inaugural and State of the Union addresses into a left-wing dream factory, from his declaration of war on global warming (on a planet where temperatures are the same as 16 years ago and in a country whose CO2 emissions are at a 20-year low) to the invention of new entitlements — e.g., universal preschool for 5-year-olds— for a country already drowning in debt.

To realize his dreams, Obama sought to fracture and neutralize the congressional GOP as a prelude to reclaiming the House in 2014. This would enable him to fully enact his agenda in the final two years of his presidency, usually a time of lame-duck paralysis. Hail the Obama juggernaut.

Well, that story — excuse me, narrative — lasted exactly six months. The Big Mo is gone.

It began with the sequester. Obama never believed the Republicans would call his bluff and let it go into effect. They did.

Taken by surprise, Obama cried wolf, predicting the end of everything we hold dear if the sequester was not stopped. It wasn’t. Nothing happened.

Highly embarrassed, and determined to indeed make (bad) things happen, the White House refused Republican offers to give it more discretion in making cuts. Bureaucrats were instructed to inflict maximum pain from minimal cuts, as revealed by one memo from the Agriculture Department demanding agency cuts that the public would feel.

Things began with the near-comical cancellation of White House tours and ended with not-so-comical airline delays. Obama thought furious passengers would blame the GOP. But isn’t the executive branch in charge of these agencies? Who thinks that a government spending $3.6 trillion a year can’t cut 2 percent without furloughing air-traffic controllers?

Looking not just incompetent at managing budgets but cynical for deliberately injuring the public welfare, the administration relented. Congress quickly passed a bill giving Obama reallocation authority to restore air traffic control. Having previously threatened to veto any such bill, Obama caved. He signed.

Not exactly Appomattox, but coming immediately after Obama’s spectacular defeat on gun control, it marked an administration that had lost its “juice,” to paraphrase a charming question at the president’s Tuesday news conference.

For Obama, gun control was a political disaster. He invested capital. He went on a multi-city tour. He paraded grieving relatives. And got nothing. An assault-weapons ban — a similar measure had passed the Congress 20 years ago — lost 60 to 40in a Senate where Democrats control 55 seats. Obama failed even to get mere background checks.

All this while appearing passive, if not helpless, on the world stage. On Syria, Obama is nervously trying to erase the WMD red line he had so publicly established. On Benghazi, he stonewalled accusations that State Department officials wishing to testify are being blocked.

He is even taking heat for the Boston bombings. Every day brings another revelation of signals missed beforehand. And his post-bombing pledge to hunt down those responsible was mocked by the scandalous Mirandizing of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, gratuitously shutting down information from the one person who knows more than anyone about possible still-existent explosives, associates, trainers, future plans, etc.

Now, the screw will undoubtedly turn again. If immigration reform passes, Obama will be hailed as the comeback kid, and a new “Obama rising” narrative proclaimed.

This will overlook the fact that immigration reform has little to do with Obama and everything to do with GOP panic about the Hispanic vote. In fact, Obama has been asked by congressional negotiators to stay away, so polarizing a figure has he become.

Nonetheless, whatever happens, the screw will surely turn again, if only because of media boredom. But that’s the one constant of Washington political life: There are no straight-line graphs. We live from inflection point to inflection point.

And we’ve just experienced one. From king of the world to dead in the water in six months. Quite a ride.

Jay Nixon.

The new law stops short of requiring schools to teach the Eddie Eagle Gunsafe Program. But by putting it in state law, Missouri is providing one of the stronger state-sanctioned endorsements of the NRA-sponsored firearms safety course, which the group says is taught to about 1 million children annually.

The legislation also requires school personnel to participate in an “active shooter and intruder” drill led by law enforcement officers.

Both the staff and student training initially were proposed as mandates when the legislation was filed on Dec. 13, which was the day before a gunman massacred 26 people in a Connecticut elementary school, including 20 first-graders. The provision about the first-grade gun-safety course was amended to make it optional during Senate debate.

The legislation also transfers the responsibility for issuing identification cards for concealed gun permits from driver’s license clerks to local sheriffs. That change was prompted by concerns that the state licensing agency’s procedures had infringed on people’s privacy rights.

Nixon noted the change in concealed carry permits — not the school gun-safety programs — while announcing he was signing the legislation. Asked if he supported the NRA’s gun safety course for first-graders, Nixon merely noted that it was optional.

“Allowing the local school districts to make those choices is appropriate,” he said.

The legislation was one of several pro-gun measures passed this year by Missouri’s Republican-led Legislature.

Nixon, a Democrat, vetoed a bill last week that would have allowed federal agents to be charged with state crimes for trying to enforce various federal gun control laws. The vetoed bill also could have landed Missouri journalists in jail for publishing the names of gun owners and would have let specially trained teachers and administrators carry concealed guns into schools.

But Nixon signed a less aggressive gun-rights bill last week, which allows state employees to keep firearms in their vehicles and fire chiefs to get local approval to carry concealed guns.

According to the NRA, more than 20 state legislatures have passed measures encouraging the use of its Eddie Eagle course in schools since the gun safety program began in 1988. Ohio became the first state to provide financing for it about a decade ago. But Missouri is among just a few states — including North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia — to endorse the program with state laws.

The program includes a video in which an eagle character teaches children four basic rules if they see a gun: “STOP! Don’t touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult.”

“It’s teaching a great safety message to children that could possibly save their life,” said Eric Lipp, the NRA’s national manager of community outreach.

In many cases, Lipp said, the course is taught by police serving as school resources offices and the materials are provided for free by the NRA. He estimated that the program has been used in thousands of schools.

Some of Missouri’s school teacher and administrator groups took no position on the legislation, largely because it’s merely optional. It was unclear how many Missouri schools already are using the program, or whether the official allowance for it in state law will encourage more to do so.

“How many districts will do this is anyone’s guess,” said Brent Ghan, a spokesman for the Missouri School Boards’ Association."

The left wants to bruise GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell in a 2014 primary and make it easier for a Democrat to win his seat. The Tea Party wants to replace McConnell with one of their own.

It looks like Democrats are taking a page out of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s playbook.

The Republican Senate Minority Leader once said that his single most important goal was to make President Obama a one-term president. All GOP politicking, McConnell implied, would be aimed not at governing, but at ensuring the president didn’t win re-election. And now, Kentucky liberals seem as single-minded in their focus on beating McConnell, going so far as to work with Tea Party groups to succeed in their 2014 quest.

The strategy is simple. The left wants to bruise McConnell in the primaries and make it easier for a Democrat to win in the general election. The Tea Party wants to nominate one of their own members and catapult their nominee to Capitol Hill.

Shawn Reilly, executive director of liberal political action committee Progress Kentucky, told MSNBC.com that his group has been reaching out to Tea Party leaders in the state to see how they can work together. That includes the possibility of paying to run advertisements for Tea Party-backed candidates. (According to federal rules, the PACs can’t directly donate to the candidate.) And liberals are also planning to hold joint protests with Tea Partiers at McConnell events in the state to “make sure he knows the people of Kentucky are united against him.”

“We’re reaching out to Tea Party groups for support on issues where we can agree on,” he said.

And those issues are clear: Mitch McConnell must go.

Sarah Durand, president of the Louisville Tea Party, told MSNBC.com that one liberal organization offered to shell out up to $1 million to her group help defeat McConnell. Other Democratic donors and fundraisers—both in and out of the state—have also reached out with offers of monetary support.

Durand understands, of course, that liberals are “salivating” over the idea of helping a far-out conservative win a primary against McConnell, potentially allowing Dems to face off against someone like failed candidates Todd Akin or Richard Mourdock in the general election.

John T. Kemper, head of the United Kentucky Tea Party, also told MSNBC.com that he has received from Democrats who want to donate to one of the grassroots movement’s candidates.

“We have talked to some Democrats that would obviously like to see him go,” said Kemper.

Indeed, McConnell seems to be in trouble. According to a new Courier-Journal Bluegrass poll, just 17% of voters say they’ll cast their ballots for him in 2014. That includes only 34% of Republicans. Meanwhile, 34% of voters are against him, 44% are waiting to see who is running against him, and 6% haven’t made up their minds.

So far, no Republicans have announced that they would run against McConnell, who has the backing of Tea Party favorite Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.

McConnell, perhaps worried about his re-election, has tried to shore up support from the far right, recently warning supporters that “gun grabbers” on Capitol Hill are trying to do away with the Second Amendment and has been giving props to Paul.

Durand said there’s legitimate concerns that that the Tea Party might go as far as to vote Democratic if McConnell is the Republican nominee.

“A lot of people say the Tea Party would never vote Democrat. It’s really not true,” she said, adding if McConnell’s the nominee, members of her party will likely vote for another party “or just stay at home.”"
http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/06/michael-bloomberg-bill-de-blasio-nyc-virginia-gun-control/,2013-11-06 00:00:00,[],"Bloomberg on Virginia election: Home state of NRA stood up and said, 'Enough'","Michael Bloomberg is the most well-known mayor in the nation - for another 55 days. But Bloomberg has already expanded his reach beyond New York City, with his coalition Mayors Against Illegal Guns and his political advocacy group Independence USA PAC.

Bloomberg dared to poke the bee hive, wading into the National Rifle Association's home state to back Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. McAuliffe eked out a win over Republican state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli Tuesday night.

""If I 20 years ago said to you a Democrat, who was F-rated by the NRA, and unabashedly in favor of commonsense gun checks, background checks – if I told you he could win governor, you would have laughed me out of the room,"" Bloomberg said in an interview with CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""

""The voters of the home state of the NRA stood up yesterday and said, 'Enough,'"" said Bloomberg,



Bloomberg's Independence USA PAC gave $1.7 million to Terry McAuliffe, and more than $3 million in Virginia races overall, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

""The people of Virginia have spoken, and the people of Virginia will be safer because of this,"" said Bloomberg.

But the people of Virginia had mixed reactions to ads run by Bloomberg's political group. Democrats tell CNN the ad supporting greater restrictions on guns played well in the Northern Virginia suburbs, but not so well in the outer suburbs, where feelings about the NRA are more positive. And in Southwestern Virginia, where McAuliffe did poorly, Bloomberg's involvement was used as a message point against him.

The NRA said some of Bloomberg’s endorsements were a bust, like the $100,000 the mayor’s political group invested in an NRA-endorsed Virginia State House candidate. “She won, he lost,” an NRA official said in an e-mail to CNN. The association also highlighted that of the 67 Virginia House Delegates the NRA endorsed, 65 won.

“It's a democracy, so not everybody is going to be on the same side. But McAuliffe won, which says a majority of the voters in Virginia want commonsense background checks,” said Bloomberg.

The mayor had a personal interest in getting involved in Virginia.

“I represent New York City. When we stop people with guns, illegal guns, more of them come from Virginia, sadly, than from any other state. So that was one of the factors that also convinced me that I should put some money into this race,” said Bloomberg.

Newly re-elected New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said Tuesday that gun control measures need to address “root problems,” and “deal with folks who have mental health issues before they act out.”

“What Governor Christie is talking about is the person that takes an automatic weapon and kills many people. And, yes, I'm very much in favor of trying to find those people and provide help and get them off the streets,” said Bloomberg.

But, he added, “That's not where most people are killed. Most people are killed one or two at a time on the streets of our cities all over this country.”

Lessons for the country

Christie was re-elected in a blue state, with about 60% of the vote.

“The lesson for this whole country, whether it was Christie or McAuliffe - both of them were centralists. They could work across the aisle,” said Bloomberg. “Being an obstructionist, or being a radical, the voters rejected that in both cases.”

Handing over the reins to Bill de Blasio

Bloomberg met with Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio for about an hour Wednesday morning. De Blasio won by a landslide last night, beating out Republican nominee Joe Lhota by about 40 percentage points. Bloomberg chose not to endorse anyone in the race.

“Bill de Blasio and I aren't going to agree on everything, but we certainly agree on a lot of things,” said Bloomberg, who added he has “a big vested interest” in ensuring his successor is a successful mayor.

“The bottom line is, I'm going to live in New York City, and I want Bill de Blasio's administration to be successful, and our administration to do everything to transfer everything we've been doing over,” said Bloomberg.

The “slippery slope” of marijuana

Several ballot initiatives on marijuana passed Tuesday night – Colorado will now tax the drug, and Portland voters approved legalizing recreational marijuana for residents 21 and older.

“This is just a bad idea,” said Bloomberg, “and a slippery slope for us to go down.”

The mayor said he worries that drug dealers who can no longer make money selling marijuana will move on to more potent drugs, and marijuana users who grow accustomed to the drug will move on to prescription drugs, or crack and cocaine.

“There's no science that says smoking a lot of strong marijuana, which is what's on the market, I'm told, today, is good for your health,” said Bloomberg.

Bloomberg 2016?

Given Bloomberg’s national recognition, and his expanding footprint in political races across the country, it is likely he will play some role in the 2016 elections.

“Let me guarantee you two things. Number one: I will vote. And number two: I won't be running … in terms of something in the middle,” said Bloomberg.

“It depends who's running, and whether I want to support them, whether I want to get involved,” said Bloomberg.

“I've got more things to do, going forward, than I can handle. In fact, I've got to start learning how to say no to new things,” said Bloomberg."

The specter of libertarianism is haunting America. Advocates of sharply reducing the government’s size, scope and spending are raising big bucks from GOP donors, trying to steal the mantle of populism, being blamed for the demise of Detroit and even getting caught in the middle of a battle for the Republican Party. Yet libertarians are among the most misunderstood forces in today’s politics. Let’s clear up some of the biggest misconceptions.

Still, hard to take any column (or movement) seriously that pretends Ayn Rand was an intellectual.

Dana Milbank:

Republicans need to make up their minds: Is President Obama a socialist or a corporate stooge? “The president claims his economic agenda is for the middle class. But it’s actually for the well-connected,” Paul Ryan, the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, wrote this week in USA Today, rejecting Obama’s latest proposal for a corporate tax cut. “There’s no doubt that it works well for them. But for the rest of us, it’s not working at all.”... Republican lawmakers seem to think that Americans have short memories and lack Internet connections, for their latest line of attack — that Obama’s health-care and tax policies favor the corporate elite — directly contradicts their previous allegation that Obama was waging “class warfare” with “socialist” policies attacking these very same corporate elites.



Making Obama out as the defender of the elite is the populism side of libertarian populism. Yeah, its as awkward as it reads here, but the GOP literally has nothing else.

Matthew Yglasias:

I've been meaning to write a deadly dull low-traffic blog post on the subject of ""libertarian populism"" for a while now, and I think my bottom line is this—economic populism can (and probably should) become more libertarian, but libertarianism can never be populist.

I'll have my own deadly dull low-traffic blog post on the subject tomorrow, Matt, so you don't have to and much more today after the fold."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/07/mass-killer-manifesto-endotrses-hillary-gun-control-elite-media,2013-02-07 00:00:00,['John Nolte'],"Suspected Mass-Murderer's Manifesto Endorses Hillary, Obama, Gun Control, Elite Media","While we pray for those murdered and everyone who might be in danger, we cannot forget that the media and its allies in the Democratic Party have set a standard when it comes to reporting on the possible political motives of mass murderers. Though they generally make things up to turn the death of innocents into a talking point against the Right, it is still the left who set this precedent.

And what do you know, Chris Dorner, the former police officer suspected of being behind the murder rampage presently unfolding in Los Angeles, has apparently left behind a manifesto addressed to America that the media are already selectively reporting on to leave out the more inconvenient portions. You see, there is no political upside for the media to reveal the politics of this suspected madman.

What is being reported as Mr. Dorner’s manifesto not only endorses Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and vigorously defends Barack Obama and the Democrats’ current gun control push; he also savages the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre while expressing all kinds of love for some of the biggest stars in the left-wing media — by name.

No Tea Partier is this suspected mass murderer, who just might be politically motivated:

Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley, and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite’s lead. I hold many of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings. …

Willie Geist, you’re a talented and charismatic journalist.

Mr. Dorner also seems to have a soft spot for those the media tells us are “safe” Republicans to like, such as George H. W. Bush and Chris Christie, “the only person I would like to see in the White House in 2016 other than Hillary.”

When it comes to defending Obama, Dorner sounds like he’s been watching an awful lot of NBC News:

You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents.

Mr. Dorner’s gun control views make it sound as though much of his thinking has been affected by CNN. In a paragraph that mentions Sandy Hook, Dorner writes:

If you had a well regulated AWB, this would not happen. The time is now to reinstitute a ban that will save lives. Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? This is the same small arms weapons system utilized in eradicating Al Qaeda, Taliban, and every enemy combatant since the Vietnam war. Don’t give me that crap that its not a select fire or full auto rifle like the DoD uses. That’s bullshit because troops who carry the M-4/M-16 weapon system for combat ops outside the wire rarely utilize the select fire function when in contact with enemy combatants.

Those sound just like Piers Morgan’s talking points, no? Well, surprise-surprise, Dornan agrees 100% with Morgan on gun control, though he does worry that Morgan is hurting the cause:

Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws[.]

The manifesto is thousands of word long and mentions dozens of people and topics. But politically, the manifesto is pretty clear.

Which is why the media will downplay it with the same amount of energy they put into amplifying their lies.

Amar Kaleka says he wants Congress to %22stop playing politics%22

Six people were killed at Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in summer 2012 by a white supremacist

Rep. Ryan%2C the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee%2C is in his eighth term in U.S. House

The son of a Wisconsin Sikh temple leader who was among those slain last year by a white supremacist says he intends to run for Congress and challenge House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan.

Amardeep Kaleka told the Associated Press that he wants to bring accountability and transparency back to Washington, and blames Ryan and his fellow Republicans for the partial government shutdown. Kaleka has been a staunch advocate for gun control, and called on Congress to impose stricter background checks on gun owners.

""There's a fever in the nation, and specifically in this district, for our leaders to stop playing politics and do their jobs,"" Kaleka said in his AP interview. ""All I want to do is bring democracy — a government of, for and by the people — back to America.""

Kaleka's father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was the founder and president of the Milwaukee-area Sikh temple where six people were killed. Wade Michael Page walked into the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in August 2012 and opened fire on several priests and worshipers. Page, who played in neo-Nazi bands, fatally shot himself after he was wounded in the parking lot by responding police.

Kaleka, 35, intends to run as a Democrat and file his paperwork Wednesday to form an exploratory committee. He helped organize a candlelight vigil this summer to mark the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting.

Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, has been targeted by Democrats before in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District. He easily won an eighth term in the House last year, even as he and Mitt Romney lost the presidential election.

Ryan marked the one-year anniversary of the shooting in Oak Creek, Wis., with a statement condemning the ""senseless act of violence"" and praising retired Lt. Brian Murphy, the first police officer to respond to the scene.

""Since that fateful day, the people of Oak Creek have come together,"" Ryan said in his statement. ""They refuse to let violence shake their community.""

A Senate bill to expand background checks on gun owners was rejected this spring, and is unlikely to come up in the Republican-controlled House.

USA TODAY

Arkansas Democrat voted against Senate bill to expand background checks on gun buyers

Pryor has been target of ads by gun-control group founded by NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg

Senator is considered one of most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in 2014

WASHINGTON -- Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor is firing back at gun-control advocates, using the first TV ad of his 2014 campaign to defend his vote against gun legislation and push back against New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The ad, coming 17 months before Pryor faces voters in Arkansas, began running statewide Friday.

Pryor was one of four Democrats who voted in April against a bill that would expand background checks on gun buyers. The Arkansas senator has been targeted in ad campaigns by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group co-founded by Bloomberg, both before and since the Senate vote.

""The mayor of New York City is running ads against me because I opposed President Obama's gun-control legislation. Nothing in the Obama plan would have prevented tragedies like Newtown, Aurora, Tucson or even Jonesboro,"" Pryor said in the ad, as he speaks directly to the camera. ""I'm committed to finding real solutions to gun violence while protecting our Second Amendment rights.""

Pryor ends the ad by saying, ""No one from New York or Washington tells me what to do. I listen to Arkansas.""

Obama blasted the politics of the gun debate after the Senate defeated the bipartisan background check proposal, calling it a ""shameful"" day. Only four Republicans supported the measure, which was considered a compromise. The bill would have expanded background checks to include purchases made at gun shows and on the Internet.

Earlier this month, Pryor told an Arkansas audience that he'd be willing to look at a revised gun proposal if it combined parts of the background checks proposal by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and another drafted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.

Pryor voted for the Grassley plan, which included strict penalties on ""straw purchases"" -- those made by someone who can legally own a gun on behalf of someone who is barred from owning a firearm.

Pryor is widely considered to be among the most vulnerable Senate Democrats seeking re-election, although a Republican opponent has not yet entered the race. Obama lost Arkansas to Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election by nearly 24 percentage points.

Pryor raised nearly $2 million from January through March in his bid for a third term, including at a fundraising event featuring former president Bill Clinton, a longtime friend of the Pryor family. Pryor's father, David, is a popular former Arkansas governor and senator."
http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2013/07/go-away-michael-bloomberg.html,,[],"Change of Subject: Go away, Michael Bloomberg!","I'm not totally unsympathetic to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's determination to spend some of his millions to fund campaigns against incumbent Democrats nationwide who appear to be in the pocket of the National Rifle Association.

But this new ad for Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill Daley goes too far:

Incumbent Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, whatever his flaws, is every bit as pro gun-control as Daley says he is. I'm sure there are reasons Bloomberg has chosen to interject himself into our race for governor -- personal fondness for Daley, a belief in Daley's business background -- but the gun issue can't be it.

If anything, Quinn now has a nice line of attack to use against Daley: ""People here in Illinois don't need the mayor of New York City telling us how to vote.""

Don't need. Don't want. Don't like.

Meanwhile, as if to shore up his bona fides, Quinn has signed an amendatory veto on the concealed-carry legislation that passed both chambers with veto-proof majorities earlier this year.

Quinn recommended that citizens be allowed to carry only one concealed weapon that can carry a maximum of 10 rounds of ammunition — a major change from the legislation which puts in place no limits on how many guns or rounds could be carried.

This seems reasonable though I can't imagine it will make a practical difference. Look, someone planning a massacre in a public place isn't going to be deterred by such a limit -- probably isn't going to go through the trouble of getting a permit -- and the whole idea of CCW is that it arms good guys. And whether you like that idea or not, it's going to be the law. So why disarm good guys?

Quinn also wants to ban guns from all places that serve alcohol, not just businesses in which booze makes up the majority of sales, as is currently written in the bill.

That covers a lot of restaurants, places of amusement, parks, street fairs and so on. If there's data showing that licensed gun owners have cause particular problem in such places in other states, let's see it. Otherwise this simply looks like a clumsy effort to neuter the right that the courts found applies here.

He also wants to clarify language to make sure guns be completely concealed instead of partially, saying a gun peeking out of a pocket or purse could incite chaos.

I have no problem with this at all, though I'm sure that gun-rights advocates fear that law enforcement will us it to harrass otherwise law-abiding gun carriers. And for once I think their paranoia may be justified.

In addition, the governor wants to give store and business owners more authority to ban guns from being carried on their property. Under the measure passed by lawmakers, guns would be allowed on the private property unless a sign was posted prohibiting them. Quinn wants to reverse that and ban guns from being carried on the private property unless an owner posts a sign giving ""express permission.""

Again, this is transparently an effort to neuter the law. It hardly places an undue burden on any business to post a sign on the door along with the other signs saying ""no firearms."" There's no doubt a fear that business owners would be reluctant to post such a sign in fear on angering gun-rights supporters, but hey...

Quinn also wants employers to have more leeway to stop guns from being carried into the workplace and to require those carrying guns to immediately inform police they are carrying a gun if questioned.

OK

And he wants to strip out a provision that would give cities only 10 days after the state law takes effect to enact a local assault weapons ban, saying local officials shouldn't have their hands tied when determining public safety needs.

I'm really with the governor on this. Either cities should have the right to enact local assault weapons bans or they shouldn't, but putting a time-limit on that right is an invitation to rash legislating and an abridgement of local authority unrelated to concealed-carry that looks a whole lot like a sop to the Illinois NRA.

If you have read my analysis so far I warn you that the time you've spent has probably been wasted (no smart remarks, please) in that there's very little chance the legislature will go along with these tweaks as they rush to override his veto by next Tuesday.

Sen. Bill Brady of Bloomington, who won the 2010 GOP nomination only to narrowly lose to Quinn, said many of the governor's proposed changes had been considered by lawmakers negotiating the bill and were rejected.

Right. There's also this paragraph:

Rep. Ken Dunkin, D-Chicago, said he is willing to sponsor follow-up legislation that would include some of Quinn's ideas. Still, Dunkin faulted Quinn for not telling lawmakers earlier what he could live with and live without in the legislation.

Quinn did not lead on this issue after a federal appeals court tossed Illinois' concealed-carry ban, the last in the nation, in December, and ordered us to come up with a law tout de suite. Who could have told you, until yesterday, where, exactly he stood on best practices for CCW?

Indeed why did it take him so long to issue this AV message? House Bill 183 passed May 31 and was sent to his desk June 6.

Now time is short. As our editorial today --Quinn's gamble on guns -- observes:

If Quinn doesn't line up the votes to support him, but he peels off enough votes to defeat an override of his veto, Tuesday will bring no new law ... and possibly chaos. Illinois could be left without a law prohibiting or regulating the concealed carry of weapons."

The invitation from Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), announced Monday, comes as some Democratic lawmakers have invited people who have been affected by gun violence to attend the presidential address.

Stockman, in a statement announcing the invitation, said he was “excited to have a patriot” like Nugent join him in the House chamber, and that afterward he’s sure “Ted will have plenty to say.”

All 23 of President Obama’s gun policy proposals

It was Nugent’s remarks at the National Rifle Assn. convention in 2012 that sparked a Secret Service investigation. Nugent, who endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said that if Obama were to win reelection he “will either be dead or in jail” and called on conservatives to “ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off.”

The Secret Service, the agency charged with protecting the president, met with Nugent shortly afterward. Nugent later called it a “good, solid, professional meeting” and said the agency concluded “that I have never made any threats of violence toward anyone.”

Stockman, who served a single term in the mid-1990s before returning to Congress this year, has already attracted attention as an outspoken critic of Obama. He announced Friday that he would live-tweet the president’s speech using the hashtag ""#youlie,” borrowing the infamous “You lie!” outburst of South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson during Obama’s speech to a joint session of Congress on healthcare in September 2009.

Stockman also said he would consider filing articles of impeachment against the president in response to executive orders Obama issued as part of his administration’s response to gun violence in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

Earlier Monday, the White House said that First Lady Michelle Obama would sit with Americans from middle-class families whose lives the president believes would be improved by his policy proposals. Among those guests will be the parents of Hadiya Pendleton, a Chicago teenager who was killed in a shooting just days after participating in events in Washington celebrating Obama’s inauguration.

Marco Rubio and Dianne Feinstein among key senators

Ex-candidate Paul Ryan carries weight on budget issues

Justice Anthony Kennedy could be pivotal on gay marriage

WASHINGTON — When he delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Obama not only will be speaking to the 40 million or so TV viewers across the country. His words also will be aimed at a few people sitting right in front of him.

A junior Republican who is key to an immigration deal. A senior Democrat who may need coaxing to compromise on gun control. A member of the GOP ticket Obama vanquished in November. And a Supreme Court justice likely to be the swing vote on same-sex marriage.

What the president says and how he says it can set the stage for cooperation or confrontation on an issue. He can boost an ally or lay down a marker. Though his inaugural address last month was soaring and thematic, the specificity of a State of the Union means it can be a sort of political dog whistle, with messages only some in the audience will be able to discern.

""Every word in a State of the Union address has multiple audiences,"" says Michael Waldman, who as chief White House speechwriter for President Bill Clinton worked on several of them. ""You care about what the sponsor of the bill hears. You care about what the rank-and-file of the Democrats or the Republicans hear. You care about what the country hears. And the notes may ring differently to different people.""

On big issues, will Obama laud the provisions that unite Republicans and Democrats or spotlight the ones that divide them? Will he mention by name his top allies and the important figures on the other side? If he does, will that make it easier or harder for them to deliver?

The annual speech to a joint session of Congress is a ""giant Wurlitzer organ for presidents,"" Waldman says, capable of playing many tunes. Here's a rundown on the key players Obama hopes will be listening to the music.

Immigration: The junior Republican

After two years in the Senate (and at age 41 a generation younger than most of his colleagues), Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has emerged as the single most crucial ally for Obama's hopes of signing a comprehensive immigration bill this year.

Rubio, who will give the Republican response to Obama's speech Tuesday, is a member of a group of four Republican and four Democratic senators that outlined the framework for a bill that would manage the flow of legal immigrants and provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants now in the USA. The group includes other important figures, among them Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John McCain, R-Ariz. A bipartisan group of House members is also at work.

It was Rubio, the son of Cuban emigres, who launched into fluent Spanish at a news conference announcing the group's broad principles — underscoring the imperative many Republicans feel to reach out to Latino voters, who overwhelmingly backed Obama in November.

And it was Rubio, a favorite of the Tea Party movement, who is doing much of the selling job to conservative critics. Radio host Rush Limbaugh, who had bashed the bipartisan framework, had only praise for Rubio after he appeared on his show, calling his efforts ""admirable and noteworthy."" Rubio is a crucial emissary to House Republicans, many of them from solidly GOP districts where most voters oppose providing a path to legal status for illegal immigrants.

Winning passage in the House almost certainly will be more difficult than the Senate.

""Rubio is viewed by some Republicans as doing on the Republican side what Obama did on the Democratic side: Get into office for a nanosecond and start to run for president,"" says Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. ""At the same time, he's absolutely essential to the problem they have with Latinos. He clearly has the Tea Party credibility, and he's the younger generation.""

That makes him a valuable commodity for the GOP — and, potentially, for Obama. Meissner says she'll be listening for the president's approach in his speech. ""Does he frame this in a way that signals he and the Democrats will do this in a way that it is a win-win for Republicans also, and not an 'I-win-you-lose?'""

Guns: The senior Democrat

The repercussions of gun violence propelled Dianne Feinstein's career. She was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978 when Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated in City Hall by a gunman. She discovered Milk's body that day. She succeeded Moscone as mayor.

Two years after she was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992, Feinstein was the author of an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. After last year's shooting rampage in Newtown, Conn., killed 20 children and six educators, she filed a bill that would impose a stricter version of the ban.

Some key fellow Democrats haven't rallied behind her, at least not yet. Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., hasn't endorsed the proposal, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., warns that it would be hard to get it through the Senate, much less the House. Feinstein bristled at the list of witnesses at the first Senate hearing on gun legislation as tilted against the ban and says she will call her own hearing.

At 79, Feinstein is in her fifth Senate term. When it comes to guns, the issue for Obama is not her support but her willingness to compromise. Will she help push a bill if the assault weapons ban isn't part of it?

Negotiations with some senators, including Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have focused on expanding background checks for gun buyers and other less divisive issues.

""It's a very difficult rhetorical challenge,"" says Matt Bennett, formerly of Americans for Gun Safety but now at the centrist think-tank Third Way. ""He doesn't want to say, 'We may not get the assault weapons ban done.' But he can put a lot of emphasis on universal background checks, on a firearms trafficking statute, on the kind of things Manchin and Coburn are ready to make deals on.""

In the State of the Union, the president not only can draw a line in the sand for his opponents on what must be done but also send a message to his allies on the limits of what can be done. Bennett asks, ""Is he going to be telling Democrats on guns, immigration and on fiscal issues, 'You have got to be willing to make some concessions?'""

Budget: The wannabe veep

Obama tried to reach a ""grand bargain"" with House Speaker John Boehner last year that would raise tax revenue and cut spending, including changes to Medicare and Social Security.

The talks failed and soured relations between the two. The issues haven't gone away, gaining urgency as automatic spending cuts are poised to take effect March 1, and the resolution that funds government operations expires March 27.

Out front for the GOP on these issues is House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who was Mitt Romney's 2012 running mate.

Ryan didn't make it to the vice presidency, but since the election, he helped pass a compromise plan on taxes and devise the party's strategy to delay dealing with the debt ceiling until spring.

He is drawing up a budget plan he says will balance the books in 10 years. He'll be at the center of the looming fiscal negotiations.

He was critical and deficit hawks were disappointed when Obama mentioned only in passing the need for hard choices to address the federal deficit and the national debt in his inaugural address. They expect to hear more in this address.

""I don't think that, given the fiscal picture of the country, he can possibly talk about the state of the union without addressing it,"" says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The parts that have been done are the easy parts and not the parts that are really going to fix the budget. The hard parts are still sitting there.""

They would include dealing with the exploding costs of Social Security and Medicare. ""Now the rubber is hitting the road,"" Ryan told reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Wall Street Journal. ""Our strategy is to engage the Democrats on issues where we think we can improve policy, to oppose them where we don't.""

Same-sex marriage: The swing justice

The most dramatic words in Obama's inaugural address last month may have been those embracing same-sex marriage, likening the struggle for equal rights by gay men and lesbians with those once waged by African Americans and women. At the moment, though, the battle over same-sex unions is being fought not with federal legislation but in the courts.

In two cases being argued before the Supreme Court next month, Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely to be the swing vote, as he has been on nearly all the important issues that have come before this court.

In Hollingsworth v. Perry, justices will debate the constitutionality and other issues surrounding California's Proposition 8, which amended the state constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. In U.S. v. Windsor, they will consider challenges to a 1996 federal law that denies Social Security survivor payments and other benefits to same-sex partners who were married in states that permit gay unions.

Kennedy, 76, is a Catholic appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan. Sometimes he sides with the court's consistent conservatives (Samuel Alito, John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas) and sometimes with its consistent liberals (Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor).

Supreme Court justices are invited to the State of the Union, though some choose not to attend. Kennedy was in the chamber last year.

He would hardly take instructions from Obama on this issue — he voted against the administration's position on the health care law and on campaign finance, to name two high-profile cases — but the president's rhetoric, and the societal changes it represents, could have an impact.

The administration is weighing whether to file a ""friend of the court"" brief backing the challengers in a pair of gay rights cases that will be argued before the Supreme Court in March. The Justice Department's brief would be due this month.

On previous cases involving the death penalty for juveniles and other issues, Kennedy's opinions suggest he is conscious of being on the right side of history, says Michael Klarman, a Harvard Law School professor. And there's this: Kennedy wrote the court's only two decisions supporting gay rights, in 1996 and 2003.

""The fact that the president is calling attention to same-sex marriage is a powerful iteration that society is changing and it's changing quickly,"" says Klarman, author of From the Closet to the Altar: Courts, Backlash, and the Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage, published last year. ""The president wouldn't have done it two years ago. He wouldn't have done it one year ago. The fact that the president is now making it very prominent illustrates how much society's views have changed, and that is relevant to Justice Kennedy."""

http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2013/07/go-away-michael-bloomberg.html,,[],"Change of Subject: Go away, Michael Bloomberg!","I'm not totally unsympathetic to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's determination to spend some of his millions to fund campaigns against incumbent Democrats nationwide who appear to be in the pocket of the National Rifle Association.

But this new ad for Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill Daley goes too far:

Incumbent Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, whatever his flaws, is every bit as pro gun-control as Daley says he is. I'm sure there are reasons Bloomberg has chosen to interject himself into our race for governor -- personal fondness for Daley, a belief in Daley's business background -- but the gun issue can't be it.

If anything, Quinn now has a nice line of attack to use against Daley: ""People here in Illinois don't need the mayor of New York City telling us how to vote.""

Don't need. Don't want. Don't like.

Meanwhile, as if to shore up his bona fides, Quinn has signed an amendatory veto on the concealed-carry legislation that passed both chambers with veto-proof majorities earlier this year.

Quinn recommended that citizens be allowed to carry only one concealed weapon that can carry a maximum of 10 rounds of ammunition — a major change from the legislation which puts in place no limits on how many guns or rounds could be carried.

This seems reasonable though I can't imagine it will make a practical difference. Look, someone planning a massacre in a public place isn't going to be deterred by such a limit -- probably isn't going to go through the trouble of getting a permit -- and the whole idea of CCW is that it arms good guys. And whether you like that idea or not, it's going to be the law. So why disarm good guys?

Quinn also wants to ban guns from all places that serve alcohol, not just businesses in which booze makes up the majority of sales, as is currently written in the bill.

That covers a lot of restaurants, places of amusement, parks, street fairs and so on. If there's data showing that licensed gun owners have cause particular problem in such places in other states, let's see it. Otherwise this simply looks like a clumsy effort to neuter the right that the courts found applies here.

He also wants to clarify language to make sure guns be completely concealed instead of partially, saying a gun peeking out of a pocket or purse could incite chaos.

I have no problem with this at all, though I'm sure that gun-rights advocates fear that law enforcement will us it to harrass otherwise law-abiding gun carriers. And for once I think their paranoia may be justified.

In addition, the governor wants to give store and business owners more authority to ban guns from being carried on their property. Under the measure passed by lawmakers, guns would be allowed on the private property unless a sign was posted prohibiting them. Quinn wants to reverse that and ban guns from being carried on the private property unless an owner posts a sign giving ""express permission.""

Again, this is transparently an effort to neuter the law. It hardly places an undue burden on any business to post a sign on the door along with the other signs saying ""no firearms."" There's no doubt a fear that business owners would be reluctant to post such a sign in fear on angering gun-rights supporters, but hey...

Quinn also wants employers to have more leeway to stop guns from being carried into the workplace and to require those carrying guns to immediately inform police they are carrying a gun if questioned.

OK

And he wants to strip out a provision that would give cities only 10 days after the state law takes effect to enact a local assault weapons ban, saying local officials shouldn't have their hands tied when determining public safety needs.

I'm really with the governor on this. Either cities should have the right to enact local assault weapons bans or they shouldn't, but putting a time-limit on that right is an invitation to rash legislating and an abridgement of local authority unrelated to concealed-carry that looks a whole lot like a sop to the Illinois NRA.

If you have read my analysis so far I warn you that the time you've spent has probably been wasted (no smart remarks, please) in that there's very little chance the legislature will go along with these tweaks as they rush to override his veto by next Tuesday.

Sen. Bill Brady of Bloomington, who won the 2010 GOP nomination only to narrowly lose to Quinn, said many of the governor's proposed changes had been considered by lawmakers negotiating the bill and were rejected.

Right. There's also this paragraph:

Rep. Ken Dunkin, D-Chicago, said he is willing to sponsor follow-up legislation that would include some of Quinn's ideas. Still, Dunkin faulted Quinn for not telling lawmakers earlier what he could live with and live without in the legislation.

Quinn did not lead on this issue after a federal appeals court tossed Illinois' concealed-carry ban, the last in the nation, in December, and ordered us to come up with a law tout de suite. Who could have told you, until yesterday, where, exactly he stood on best practices for CCW?

Indeed why did it take him so long to issue this AV message? House Bill 183 passed May 31 and was sent to his desk June 6.

Now time is short. As our editorial today --Quinn's gamble on guns -- observes:

If Quinn doesn't line up the votes to support him, but he peels off enough votes to defeat an override of his veto, Tuesday will bring no new law ... and possibly chaos. Illinois could be left without a law prohibiting or regulating the concealed carry of weapons."

I will recommend people carry firearms concealed. Tactically it's a better solution; it doesn't make you out to be a target. In terms of messaging to the media, if you're carrying concealed, versus carrying an AR-15 or AR-10 slung over your back, it's a lot easier to make the statement, ""We're not here to threaten anybody. We're here standing on our soapbox, as opposed to standing with our ammo box in hand, to make a point politically.""

The message needs to get out that Scott Brown does not represent New Hampshire. If things continue the way they are, there may be a day or a time where firearms and ammo are necessary. It happened in the Revolutionary War. I'd like to think we're not there yet, but as things continue to unravel, that may be the next step. Let's stand on our soapbox this time."

Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett said he intends to follow Scalia’s guidelines.

Let’s be clear: The integrity of elections is of paramount importance. But there was little evidence of voter fraud before Prop. 200. It was part of a backlash against illegal immigration that tapped into raw emotion without stopping to engage analytical thought processes.

Undocumented immigrants were not hijacking elections. They were busing tables.

So, let’s be even more clear: Participation in elections is also of paramount importance, and Prop. 200 hurt that.

We hope that they will take it.

Ripe for the chopping block are Angela Giron, of Pueblo, and senate president John Morse, of Colorado Springs. Both ignored the will of their constituents and pushed for limits on the size of magazines and the extension of background checks to private sales. Now they may lose their jobs.

Because the United States is not a direct democracy, the dismissal of public officials outside the healthy rhythm of regularly scheduled elections is a tool that should be used sparingly. Nevertheless, there remain certain circumstances in which the offenses committed are sufficiently grievous to render such an approach appropriate, which goes some way to explaining why the citizens of Colorado have felt provoked to call for the first recall elections in the state’s 137-year history.

As in New York and Connecticut, lawmakers in Colorado were aware that gun-control efforts benefit immensely from the unlovely combination of legislative haste and emotional rawness — and they leveraged both. During debate, swathes of law-enforcement officers went to the capital to argue against the proposals; they were turned away at the door. Women, many of whom had been the victims of sexual violence, assembled to add their input; they were treated with condescension and impatience — if they were called to speak at all. Citizens who had driven down from other parts of the state were so frustrated at being kept out of committee meetings in Denver that they drove around the capitol building for eight hours honking their horns. This was not, to borrow a favored chant of the Left, what democracy looks like.

Such are the political dynamics of a lame-duck session in Springfield: some lawmakers who are in their final days of service don't show up to work, making it difficult to pass tough legislation.

The Senate Executive Committee advanced the measure on an 8-5 vote following a lengthy debate that featured testimony from both sides of the issue.

""Right now, we are in a civil union, but it is not enough,"" testified Theresa Volpe.

Springfield Catholic Bishop Thomas John Paprocki testified against the proposal, saying, ""It would radically redefine what marriage is for everybody."" He maintained the ""natural family"" is undermined by the legislation.

""Neither two men nor two women can possibly form a marriage,"" Paprocki said. ""Our law would be wrong if it said that they could.

""The basic structure of marriage as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman, committed to a life with the potential of having children, is given to us in human nature, and thus by nature's God,"" Paprocki said.

At the same time, an effort to ban semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines --- backed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel --- also lacked the votes needed for passage. Opponents argued the measure was too broad and unworkable.

With no action on those two controversial issues, senators were preparing to return home. A final day of the Senate’s lame-duck session remains an option for Tuesday, the day before the next General Assembly is inaugurated. But that could depend on whether the House takes any action. House members are scheduled to be in Springfield from Sunday through Tuesday.

The media, which is always ready to destroy any black man who dares think for himself, uniformly pounced today. In response to the manufactured uproar, the soft-spoken Carson (who was a hero to the left until he came out as a conservative), did the interview rounds on cable Friday, including Andrea Mitchell’s show on MSNBC and Wolf Blitzer’s on CNN.

In both appearances, Carson apologized for what he said and made clear that he wasn’t comparing gay couples to pedophiles or those erotically charged by animals. His point was that God defined what marriage is, not man, and if man changes that definition, it can lead to anything.

Carson also said he was in favor of giving same-sex couples the same rights as married couples, short of marriage.

NBC News obviously wants to destroy the threat of any independent-thinking black man as quickly as possible. So it should come as no surprise that, by the time Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart filled in for MSNBC’s Martin Bashir, Carson’s apology was treated as far from sufficient. In short, Capehart and his guests, Toure’ and Krystal Ball, treated the apology as a lie.

This is all par for the course at NBC News.

Sadly, so is the chryron pictured above — “Blinded by the White” — which was used as the clip of Dr. Carson played during the segment.

NBC News is notorious for using this kind of race-baiting to further its left-wing agenda, including fraud:

During last year’s GOP primary, Ed Schultz edited video of Texas Governor Rick Perry to make him look racist.

In April of last year, the “Today Show” was caught editing audio of a 9-1-1 call to make George Zimmerman look racist.

In August of 2009, Contessa Brewer sliced and diced a photograph so it wouldn’t look like a black man attended a Tea Party carrying a firearm.

So it was only a matter of time before they went after Carson in this way for his apostasy.

At the same time, an effort to ban semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines --- backed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel --- also lacked the votes needed for passage. Opponents argued the measure was too broad and unworkable.



With no action on those two controversial issues, senators were preparing to return home. A final day of the Senate's lame-duck session remains an option for Tuesday, the day before the next General Assembly is inaugurated. But that could depend on whether the House takes any action. House members are scheduled to be in Springfield from Sunday through Tuesday.

(CNN) —

In the days before the Senate voted to end a filibuster and take up gun control this week, President Barack Obama crisscrossed the nation, flying from Colorado to Connecticut in an effort to energize public opinion and pressure reluctant lawmakers.

Vice President Joe Biden also made an emotional plea at the White House. And even the first lady brought an audience to tears at a high school in Chicago where gun violence has been felt most painfully.

But, as a bipartisan group of senators reached agreement on what some have called a watered-down proposal for expanded background checks for gun purchases, the question remains whether all that lobbying really made a difference.

“It has helped, but it’s sort of a two-part story,” said Robert Spitzer, author of “Politics of Gun Control” and chairman of the State University of New York-Cortland’s political science department.

“Part one is the president using the bully pulpit to make news events and congratulate those states where they’ve enacted tougher laws. There’s a certain downside that anything that Obama is for is anything his opponents are against,” Spitzer said.

As the president spent considerable political capital over the past few days to champion gun reform, opponents have raised the stakes by vocally speaking out against such policies and making it clear there will be a reckoning come Election Day for any lawmaker who supports them.

Take the president’s fiery comments on Monday in Hartford. It was a message crafted as much for lawmakers as it was for the families of students and educators killed in December’s school massacre in Newtown, which is not far from where Obama spoke.

The families sat behind him on stage and traveled to Washington with him on Air Force One to lobby Congress on gun control.

“This is not about politics,” the president said to applause. “This is not about politics.”

“This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let’s make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down.”

But it is, at least in part, about politics.

Why we’re still debating guns

Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat and avid gun supporter who helped lead a bipartisan compromise agreement with fellow senator Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, over background checks, was visibly moved after meeting with Sandy Hook families.

“I can do something,” an emotional Manchin told parents who lost children in the attack.

But when the pair announced their compromise to expand federal background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, the executive director of the Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt, tweeted the sentiment of many in his organization.

“May Sen. Toomey experience in 2016 the same as he did to Sen. Specter in 2010.”

In 2010, Toomey was the more conservative challenger to the late Sen. Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania’s Republican senatorial primary. Specter, who beat Toomey in a similar, contentious GOP primary in 2004, later switched parties and lost in the Democratic primary to Rep. Joe Sestack, who then lost to Toomey in the general election.

“It means that he ought to be held politically accountable and the way to do it is in the primaries,” Pratt told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in a heated exchange, indicating his organization would support a primary challenge to Toomey when he is up for reelection in 2016.

The timing of Obama’s speech in Hartford preceded the Senate’s vote clearing the way for consideration of a Democrat-backed gun control package. The House of Representatives has not yet decided when or if it will take up a similar bill.

And the timing of first lady Michelle Obama’s emotional homecoming to Chicago, speaking Wednesday at a luncheon fundraiser for a new initiative seeking to curb youth violence, was not by accident, either.

She recalled the shooting death of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who was killed a week after performing in Washington during the Inauguration in January. Saying Pendleton “was me, and I was her,” Mrs. Obama reflected on the opportunities that led her to the White House instead of a similar fate.

Obama was in Colorado last week, just miles from the scene of last July’s movie theater shooting that left 12 people dead, to push for expanded background checks.

“I’ve come here to Denver today because Colorado, in particular, is proving a model for what’s possible,” Obama told the audience.

Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper recently signed measures into law that will require universal background checks for gun sales, restrict the size of ammunition magazines and make buyers pay for their own background checks.

Before the Colorado gun-control vote, Biden, who heads the Obama administration’s efforts on the issue, called several state lawmakers to underscore the broader national importance of the heated gun control policy debate.

But those efforts may have backfired, galvanizing pro-gun advocates instead. Colorado gun groups have vowed to help defeat lawmakers in tough districts who supported passing the gun control package.

“I don’t want to go their cocktail parties. I don’t want to make friends. I just don’t want them to stop Americans of their rights including me and my kids,” said Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners.

His group, as well as pro-gun rights groups and publications, such as Concealed Carry magazine, have stepped up gun giveaways in states like Colorado, New York and Arizona, where tough gun control laws have passed or are pending.

The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest and most powerful gun lobby group, said Wednesday that expanding background checks at gun shows “will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools.”

The group’s leaders have also been deeply critical of Obama’s efforts.

“President Obama should be as committed to dealing with the gang problem that is tormenting honest people in his hometown as he is to blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers,” the NRA said in a statement.

Obama has often said that the fight for new gun control is personal.

He wiped away tears when reflecting on the Newtown shooting spree. And the president was animated in talking about what he sees as national support for stricter gun control policies.

However, gun control advocates have worried and polls have shown that in the months following the Newtown shooting, support for stricter gun laws has waned.

In that, Obama’s fierce push to keep the issue up front has been extremely valuable to those seeking stricter gun laws, Spitzer said.

“It’s an imperative that the president be out front on this issue,” Spitzer said. “Obama’s ability to keep this in the minds of the public paves the way a little more for legislative reforms.”

Obama talked about gun violence and Hadiya Pendleton

Police say shooting was case of mistaken identity

CHICAGO (AP) — An 18-year-old Chicago woman was killed the same day her sister had sat on the stage behind President Obama, listening to him push for gun control legislation.

Janay Mcfarlane was shot once in the head around 11:30 p.m. Friday in North Chicago, Lake County Coroner Thomas Rudd told the Chicago Sun-Times. Mcfarlane, a mother of a 3-month-old boy, was in the Chicago suburb visiting friends and family.

North Chicago police said two people are being questioned in connection with Mcfarlane's death, but no charges have been filed.

""I really feel like somebody cut a part of my heart out,"" Angela Blakely, Mcfarlane's mother, said.

Blakely said the bullet that killed Mcfarlane was meant for a friend.

Hours earlier, Mcfarlane's 14-year-old sister was feet from Obama at Hyde Park Career Academy, where he spoke about gun violence and paid tribute to Hadiya Pendleton, the 15-year-old honor student fatally shot last month in a South Side park. Police have said it was a case of mistaken identity, and two people have been charged.

Pendleton's death was one of more than 40 homicides in Chicago in January, a total that made it the deadliest January in the city in more than a decade. Pendleton, a drum majorette, had recently performed during Obama's inauguration and the slaying happened about a mile from his Chicago home.

Blakely told the newspaper that Janay Mcfarlane had been affected by Pendleton's death.

""She always said after Hadiya Pendleton got killed, 'Momma that's so sad,'"" Blakely said. ""She was always touched by any kid that got killed. She was always touched by mothers who couldn't be there for their babies because they were gone.""

Mcfarlane was supposed to graduate from an alternative school this spring, Blakely said, and wanted to go into the culinary arts.

""I'm just really, truly just trying to process it — knowing that I'm not taking my baby home anymore,"" Blakely said."

USA TODAY

Former president says Zimmerman jury answered %22legal question%2C%22 not %22moral one%22

George Zimmerman was acquitted in shooting death of Trayvon Martin

Carter said he believes jury %22listened to the evidence%22

Former president Jimmy Carter said the jury in the George Zimmerman trial ""made the right decision"" and agrees with President Obama that Americans should respect its judgment.

Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted last Saturday in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Carter, the nation's 39th president, made his comments about the high-profile case in an interview Tuesday with WXIA in Atlanta.

""I think the jury made the right decision based on the evidence presented because the prosecution inadvertently set the standard so high that the jury had to be convinced that it was a deliberate act by Zimmerman and that he was not at all defending himself,"" Carter said.

""It's not a moral question,"" he continued, ""it was a legal question and the American law requires that the jury listens to the evidence presented.""

Trayvon's death sparked outcry over Florida's ""stand your ground"" laws and a national debate over racial profiling. State prosecutors argued during the trial that Zimmerman profiled and murdered the teenager, then lied about the Trayvon initiating the fight.

Since Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder, protests have occurred in some communities across the country.

Asked if race was a factor in the jury's decision, Carter said he believes the six women based their decision on the evidence that was presented. ""I can't allege the six jurors ... are not just as sensitive about the race issue as I am or you are,"" he said. ""I would presume they listened to the evidence.""

Pollak'],3 Problems with Obama's Navy Yard Speech the Media Still Ignore,"The mainstream media have awoken to the fact that President Barack Obama’s partisan attack on Republicans during the Navy Yard attack on Monday may not have been the best idea, even if only for tactical reasons.

The New York Times‘ Maureen Dowd worried that Obama’s speech meant that he “cannot seem to connect anymore” and concluded that the president had been “overtaken by events.” The Hill called it a political “blunder” and agreed, via a quote from a “former aide,” that he had been “overtaken by events.” (Poor President Obama, always the victim of circumstances not of his own making, always “overtaken by events”!)

While it is encouraging that the media have noticed Obama’s attack–even though most networks cut away after he briefly mentioned the Navy Yard shooting–they continue to ignore three glaring problems:

1. The fact that Obama never considered canceling or postponing the speech. A president who does not realize that a mass shooting on a military base in the nation’s capital city is a reason to suspend politics as usual is dangerously removed from his duties as commander-in-chief–never mind the political damage. In addition, he is receiving bad advice, ignoring good advice, or simply not being advised by staff who have learned that he tunes out all but a select group of trusted Chicago insiders and loyalists. By putting politics first, the Obama administration is putting the nation at risk–at a time when risks are only growing.

2. The fact that the media pilloried Mitt Romney for lesser sins in 2012. When Mitt Romney issued a statement criticizing the Obama administration’s apologetic response to the Cairo embassy attack on Sep. 11 last year, the media attacked him viciously. Romney, too, was “overtaken by events”: he did not know that four Americans would be killed in Benghazi. But the media never let Romney forget his alleged gaffe, while giving Obama a pass for his inaction that night. Because the media never hold Obama accountable for anything, he rarely takes his governing responsibilities seriously, exacerbating a dangerous vacuum in national leadership.

3. The fact that the Navy Yard attack happened at all, four years after Ft. Hood. It is easier for the Obama-supporting media to dwell on an inappropriate speech than to ask the much more important question: how did the attack happen at all? Four years after a similar mass shooting at Fort Hood, was nothing done to improve security at military bases? Why were rules restricting guns on base not changed? Did the Obama administration let the nation’s guard down by downplaying Ft. Hood as “workplace violence” instead of terrorism? Why, after the NSA scandal, was there no review of security clearance procedures and lists?"

http://news.yahoo.com/newtown-report-renews-focus-role-lanzas-mom-203652944.html,,[],Newtown report renews focus on role of Lanza's mom,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — As Adam Lanza withdrew from the world into his bedroom, the only person he appeared to be close to was his mother, who cooked his favorite meals, did his laundry daily — and bonded with him over shooting and guns.

Investigators' final report on last year's school massacre in Newtown provided new insights into Nancy Lanza's home life with her troubled adult son and renewed the debate over whether she bears any responsibility for the bloodbath that began with her shooting death.

""I think that we will always be bewildered by someone who did express her concern for her son, why she sought to have him engage with firearms,"" Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Tuesday. ""Not even those folks who oppose reasonable gun safety legislation would argue that it was a good idea to have someone who was evidencing this kind of disturbance have possession of the kinds of weapons that he had possession of.""

Adam Lanza's fascination with violence was apparent to teachers and other acquaintances, investigators said in their report. He collected materials on mass killings and kept a spreadsheet ranking of mass murders.

But his mother wasn't allowed to enter his bedroom, according to the report, and it was unclear how much she knew about his obsession.

While the details released Monday led some observers to direct their anger at her, suggesting she was more enabler than victim, others were more sympathetic.

A friend of hers, Marvin LaFontaine, said Tuesday that she did her best raising her son even though he was difficult and resisted help from others or talking about issues such as other children picking on him.

""That really frustrated her,"" LaFontaine said. ""It just wore her down to the bone.""

James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said Nancy Lanza didn't ignore her son's psychological problems and can't be blamed for his actions.

""She was a victim, not an accessory,"" he said. ""We can easily second-guess parents, and there's a lot there we can question, but the fact of the matter is many people commit horrible crimes despite the best efforts of parents, siblings and others.""

Story continues

Adam Lanza, 20, shot his mother in the head four times Dec. 14, then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he killed 20 first-graders and six women with a semi-automatic rifle. He committed suicide as police arrived.

The report detailed some of the family's efforts to address the needs of a young man described as withdrawn, lacking an appreciation of other's feelings, and beset with ""significant mental health issues.""

He had evaluations of many types over the years, he was home-schooled for a period because he did not like the noise at Newtown High School, and he refused medications and behavior therapies that were suggested for him.

Some parents of other troubled young adults said they can understand what Nancy Lanza was going through.

Peggy Sinclair-Morris, a special education teacher in Midlothian, Va., said it was like the ""wild, wild West"" as she tried to find the right treatment for her 18-year-old daughter, who has an anxiety disorder and has attempted suicide several times. If your child does not have certain symptoms, she said, you can get passed around by the system.

""I feel empathy for his mom just because, like I said, you try to find the services, and when they're not available, you try to do what you have to do to help your kids,"" Sinclair-Morris said. ""Just because your son committed that horrible act doesn't mean she was a horrible mother.""

Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Adam's father, indicated that she did not work because of her son's condition. In their spacious Newtown home, she catered to his requests, cooking to his specifications and getting rid of a cat because he did not want it in the house.

In the weeks before the massacre, she said her son hadn't gone anywhere in three months and that they would communicate only by email, even though they lived under the same roof.

She often took her son shooting at a gun range. She legally purchased all the weapons her son carried the day of the massacre, and she had written a check to buy him a pistol for Christmas.

The report said that she was concerned about her son, but that she never expressed fear that she or anyone else was in danger from him. He was never violent or threatening toward others before the attack, according to the report.

A spokesman for Lanza's father, Peter Lanza, didn't respond to a request for comment.

The strong majority in favor of considering legislation that would expand background checks and increase the penalties for illegal gun sales reflected the power of a lobbying campaign by parents of students killed in Newtown, Conn., and by others who persuaded reluctant lawmakers to back them in an initial fight that looked lost just last week. The vote was 68 to 31.

“It’s remarkable,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut whose nascent Senate career has been devoted to gun safety. “You can’t turn a corner in the Capitol this week without meeting a family of a gun violence victim. It’s hard to say no to these families.”

But the victory could be short-lived. The vote in no way guaranteed passage of the gun measure; some Republicans and Democrats who voted for this initial step made clear they are not committed to supporting any final measure, even if they agreed to allow the debate."

A Justice Department investigation of possible civil rights violations is underway

Trayvon Martin%27s family could sue in civil court%2C where the standard of proof is lower

A wrongful death lawsuit seeks money damages rather than punishment

George Zimmerman's business with the criminal court in Florida may be done, but a federal civil rights investigation remains open, and legal experts say he could face a civil suit.

A federal investigation into the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin is underway, and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida criminal trial, the Justice Department said Sunday in a written statement.

Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated townhouse community in Sanford, Fla., shot and killed Trayvon on Feb. 26, 2012, as he returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he shot the unarmed African-American teenager in self-defense.

""Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,"" the statement said.

NAACP President Ben Jealous said on CNN that the civil rights organization had spoken with Justice Department officials about lodging federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

""There will be a federal civil rights phase,"" Jealous said.

Trayvon's family could sue Zimmerman in civil court for wrongful death, following the example of the families of O.J. Simpson's former wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, who sued the football star and won $33.5 million after he was acquitted on murder charges. A wrongful death lawsuit seeks money damages rather than punishment.

Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., issued a statement urging the family to sue Zimmerman.

""While I am profoundly disappointed with the ruling in this case, the criminal portion of the process has run its course,"" Wilson said. ""I encourage Trayvon's parents to pursue vindication of their rights under civil law.""

Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the verdict a ""tragic miscarriage of justice.""

""No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin would still be alive with his family today,"" she said in a statement. ""Yet there is still the potential for justice to be served through a civil suit brought about by Trayvon Martin's surviving family members, and also through civil rights charges.""

Although Zimmerman has few assets, a book or movie deal could make him a lucrative target for a wrongful death suit, said Randy Reep, a criminal defense attorney in Jacksonville.

Apart from money, the family might sue ""if only for a victory in principle,"" he said.

Despite the acquittal in criminal court, Trayvon's parents could win in civil court, where a lower standard of proof prevails, he said. A jury in civil court need only be convinced that Zimmerman ""more likely than not"" is responsible for Trayvon's wrongful death, he said. In a criminal court, a jury can acquit if they have ""reasonable doubt.""

Zimmerman would be immune to such a lawsuit only if he asked for a hearing under Florida's ""stand-your-ground"" law and a judge found he justifiably used force in self-defense in the face of an ""unlawful threat,"" Reep said.

Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, commented Saturday night on the possibility of suits against his client.

""On the civil aspect, if someone believes that it's appropriate to sue George Zimmerman, then we will seek and we will get immunity in a civil hearing.

""We'll see just how many civil lawsuits are spawned from this fiasco.""

In the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., there is a priority in the region’s schools: ensuring safety. At West Springfield High in Fairfax County, Officer Joe Plazio patrols the halls.

In the wake of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., there is a priority in the region’s schools: ensuring safety. At West Springfield High in Fairfax County, Officer Joe Plazio patrols the halls.

In the anxious weeks after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the idea of bringing more police into the nation’s schools has picked up support. But for many parents and educators, there is a more immediate priority: protecting schoolhouse doors.

Some schools in the Washington area lack buzzer entrance systems. Some leave a main door open, with a sign asking visitors to report to the office. Some, according to parents, do not closely screen all visitors or use different rules for after-school activities and child-care programs.

What happened at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14 — when gunman Adam Lanza overcame a security system, shooting out glass near the school entrance, police said, before killing 20 children and six staff members — sent the nation reeling and brought new attention to school entry points.

Across the Washington region, officials in many school systems — including those of the District and Fairfax, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties — say they have strong practices already in place and are taking a close look for areas of improvement.

But the aftermath of the Connecticut tragedy has spotlighted inconsistencies at schools, funding concerns and a heightened interest in basic security measures, even if they would not prevent an attack like the one at Sandy Hook.

In Virginia, 2012 data show that controlled access systems are in place at 59 percent of elementary schools, 51 percent of middle schools and 37 percent of high schools.

Seventy-three percent of schools said they lock up during school hours, and 46 percent said they had someone posted at the front entrance to ensure that visitors check in. Just more than half of schools said all classroom doors could be locked from inside and outside. Maryland and D.C. officials said they could not provide similar figures last week.

“We just have to do everything possible . . . and just say a prayer,” said Montgomery County Board of Education member Patricia O’Neill (Bethesda-Chevy Chase) moments before a January vote to speed up a $364,000 project to install buzz-in systems, with exterior cameras and intercoms, at a final group of elementary schools.

In Maryland, Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) has proposed spending $25 million in construction money in the coming year to tighten physical security at public schools, with cameras at entrances, automatically locking doors, shatterproof glass and buzzer entrance systems.

“A lot of what we’re doing is strengthening what’s already in place,” said State Superintendent Lillian M. Lowery, who noted that Maryland is reviewing every district’s emergency plans while seeking best practices and looking to “put in as many safeguards as possible.”

In Virginia, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) created a school safety task force that is expected to issue a set of recommendations Thursday.

At a Jan. 16 public meeting about security in Rockville, the father of a kindergartner focused on beefing up security at elementary schools. The mother of a high-schooler asked about doors near portable classroom trailers.

Then there was parent Mike Richman’s pointed question: Shouldn’t all middle school doors be locked?

“Are they?” Richman asked.

Officials in local systems say schools lock exterior doors, but not all entrances are locked in all school systems. In some districts, schools with younger students often have tighter building controls, and schools with older students have more security staff or police on the premises.

“Security is always a balance,” said Robert Hellmuth, safety and security director for Montgomery schools. The goal, he said, is to control who gets inside schools while not turning them into fortresses.

Experts say schools are among the safest places for the young. Researcher Dewey Cornell, who studies school safety at the University of Virginia, says 99 percent of homicides of children ages 5 to 18 occur outside of school.

Nationally, schools became more vigilant about locking doors, and some installed buzzer systems, after the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School, said Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant.

“The momentum faded four to six years after Columbine,” Trump said. “The mind-set became more and more lax.”

Trump said secure entrances are critical in schools — and need to be paired with well-trained school staff so that visitors are noticed and screened.

At Sandy Hook, the security system might have prevented more deaths, Trump said, because it slowed the gunman’s entrance.

“Those were seconds that gave people on the inside time to lock down,” he said. “Seconds count.”

Police officers, although the focus of many proposals nationally, are primarily used locally in secondary schools, with the greatest number in the District, which has 100 “school resource officers” and 300 security guards in its 118 buildings.

Elsewhere, there are 53 armed school resource officers in Fairfax, 27 in Loudoun County, 22 in Prince George’s, 19 in Prince William County, and six each in Montgomery and Alexandria. Many systems rely on unarmed security staff in large numbers.

Elected leaders are now rethinking how much security is enough.

An effort to boost the law enforcement presence in Montgomery schools has gained momentum since Sandy Hook. “I think people are thinking about it now and connecting the dots,” County Council member Craig Rice (D-Upcounty) said.

The tragedy also has spurred new action in Prince George’s, where a push is underway for increasing the number of buzzer systems and closer monitoring of school visitors. Other recommendations expected to come before the school board include hiring 10 more resource officers and buying panic buttons to allow a surreptitious call for help in an emergency.

“Certainly, this has heightened everyone’s awareness,” said Michael Blow, director of security services in Prince George’s schools.

Prince George’s County Council member Ingrid Turner (D-Bowie) raised concerns at a meeting last week about visitors appearing to enter schools unnoticed. “When I’m home, my door is locked,” she said later. “It’s a question that needs to be discussed and dialogued.”

In Fairfax, every elementary and middle school is equipped with buzz-in systems except three that will have the work completed in coming weeks. “We’ve asked our vendors to step up, and they’ve been great,” said Fred Ellis, director of safety and security.

Still, Ellis says access control systems are not “a panacea” and all security measures rely on good judgments inside a school, such as questioning someone who buzzes at the door or stopping a visitor without a pass.

Ellis and others also pointed out that security measures often reflect what people are “willing to give up in terms of convenience, access, the whole environment of the school, and what are they willing to pay to fund it.”

School Board member Megan McLaughlin (Braddock) said any security changes in Fairfax should be thoughtful and made with a focus on preserving a welcoming learning environment. “I would rather have all of our doors locked and secured than have armed officers in our schools,” she said. “To me, that’s a healthy trade-off.”

The project to install buzzer entrance systems in Montgomery’s 139 elementary schools was in the works before Sandy Hook. But a final group of 26 schools was not due for the improvements until next school year.

Parents wrote letters.

“I’ve never seen anything go through local government so quickly,” said Arielle Grill, a Bethesda parent who urged the project be accelerated. Grill said she does not want schools to become fortresses but thinks that “locking the front door of an elementary school is just so fundamental to keeping kids safe.”

The project is to be completed by June.

Some also wonder about the pressure that buzz-in systems place on front office staff to make what may be tough se curity calls. “There are so many angles that need to be studied,” said Montgomery School Board Member Michael A. Durso (District 5). A national nonprofit safety group, Safe Havens International, which has developed safety plans for thousands of schools, said that in recent years, it has defeated security systems in more than 90 percent of the 200 schools it has been asked to test with in-person visits.

In but one example, Michael Dorn, the group’s executive director, said he has made his way into schools a number of times after introducing himself as Ted Bundy — the name of an infamous serial killer — and explaining the purpose of his visit as “an ax to grind with the principal.”

Dorn says the problem is often lack of training or the culture of a school.

“Sometimes the culture is, ‘We don’t want to offend anybody,’ ” he said. “They have not been taught to politely screen people in an effective manner. They just hit the buzzer.”

The message of Sandy Hook, Dorn said, is not to rush to spend lavishly on security extras but to take a look at potential gaps.

“It should not be a knee-jerk, big purchase but a thoughtful assessment of what school systems need and can afford,” he said.

For Sharon Burns, a first-grade teacher in Reston, Sandy Hook brought classroom doors into more urgent focus. Her elementary school, built in the “open classroom” era, was designed without individual room doors.

Burns had long wanted doors, she said, and the week after the Connecticut tragedy she collected 300 signatures on a petition. “I started thinking, what would I do with my 20 kids? Having that door could make all the difference,” she said.

Just after winter break, she learned the project had been approved. Officials say the last seven schools with an open design are getting doors, a $467,000 project. “I was so excited,” she said.

In D.C. schools, security is heavy, with guards at entrances, a buzzer system at most schools, and scanners for visitors at entrances to most middle and high schools. School leaders are working with the D.C. police to determine what else might be needed, officials said.

In Loudoun, all schools have buzzer entrance systems. Officials said the school system is reviewing all security practices, with plans to increase safeguards.

In Prince William, some schools have buzz-in systems, and processes are in place to monitor access, officials said. “We are, like everyone else, taking a hard look at our security arrangements, ” spokesman Phil Kavits said, “and seeing where they can be enhanced.”"

But there's one striking difference.

While Arizona had passed first-of-its kind legislation against illegal immigration when the uproar started over that state, Florida is hardly unique. At least 22 states have ""stand-your-ground"" laws -- which allow people to use deadly force to protect themselves often without any compulsion to retreat, and are at the center of the post-verdict controversy.

And in the case of Zimmerman, his attorneys didn't even use the law as part of their defense.

Some officials, like Attorney General Eric Holder, are calling for a review of all stand-your-ground laws. But those specifically backing a Florida boycott seem to be hinging their sudden distaste for the Sunshine State on the Zimmerman verdict -- which was reached by a jury of six people.

After civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called for people to ""isolate"" Florida, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio warned that the move would damage tourism and stoke more division in the country.

""Jesse Jackson has a history of saying outrageous things, divisive things. I would hope this would be a time when our country would come together and try to unite people and not divide people by saying things that are patently false and outrageous and offensive,"" he told MyFoxOrlando.com.

The boycott push comes following the not guilty verdict in the murder trial of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch captain who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February 2012.

The rush to wield the boycott hammer against the entire state's economy has caused hesitation among some Democrats. Maryland Rep. Donna Edwards told ""Fox News Sunday"" that such a move could be ""devastating"" to some communities in the state, though other members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- of which she is a part -- have taken up the call.

Such boycotts can, in fact, be very costly to states. When critics of the Arizona immigration law began canceling trips and conventions there in 2010, it cost millions.

The Center for American Progress issued a report finding that roughly $45 million in lodging revenue was lost in the four months after passage. When transportation, entertainment, retail and other business were factored in, the lost revenue added up to more than $140 million, according to the study.

Florida foes now see that kind of buying power as leverage to punish the state, a move that is prompting a social media battle between them and Florida's defenders.

Even the tourism-themed Visit Florida Facebook page has become a forum for online sniping over the verdict and stand-your-ground laws.

The latest post on the site -- one touting National Ice Cream Day -- almost immediately garnered the comment: ""not til they fix the law that helped kill trayvon martin.""

Another commenter posted ""good grief"" in response: ""Can't even enjoy a post about ICE CREAM and we have to read the negative comments about the SYG law.""

Those pushing for a boycott are doing what they can to make it a national movement.

MoveOn.org has gathered thousands of signatures on a petition backing a boycott, alleging the state is ""not a safe place to vacation.""

Members of California's Legislative Black Caucus also are weighing in. State Democratic Rep. Chris Holden said last week he planned to introduce a resolution calling for repeal of the stand-your-ground law -- in Florida -- while calling for a boycott in the meantime."

At least one gunman launched an attack inside the Washington Navy Yard, spraying gunfire on office workers in the cafeteria and in the hallways at the heavily secured military installation in the heart of the nation's capital, authorities said. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)

A heavily armed shooter entered the Navy Yard in Washington on Monday and opened fire, killing at least 12 people before being shot to death by authorities.

The killings brought the horror of mass shootings back into the national spotlight, as President Barack Obama condemned the ""cowardly act"" and honored the victims during an address.

Monday's violence marked the sixth mass shooting since the one in Newtown, Conn., in December, according to some counts. It was also the first publicly recognized by Obama since the elementary school massacre, which claimed the lives of 27, including 20 children.

There have been six mass shootings over the past nine months -- and at least 20 during Obama's presidency. That may be disturbing. But some would argue even that startling figure grossly underreports the number of shooting sprees.

The growing number of mass killings over the past five years left the country in search of a term that would distinguish mass murder by gun from those using other weapons. Mass shooting has gained favor as the obvious choice. Though the FBI doesn't specifically define mass shooting, it does define mass murder, calling it a single incident in which a perpetrator kills four or more people, not including himself or herself.

The FBI defined mass murder to distinguish it from serial murder. That definition provides the basis for the unofficial definition of mass shooting that has gained use in recent years. Mother Jones explained the definition in an extensive ""Guide to Mass Shootings in America,"" writing that mass shootings typically involve a single episode in a single location, usually a public place. The Mother Jones definition of mass shooting matches the FBI definition of mass murder in that it includes single incidents that kill at least four victims.

Over on Reddit, the Guns Are Cool community has compiled a list of every mass shooting in the United States this year. The moderators of the subreddit, which doesn't actually appear to be of the belief that guns are cool, use an expanded definition of mass shooting, listing every event in which ""four or more people [including the shooter] are shot in a spree."" Under the Reddit definition, a shooting spree that wounds at least four people, but doesn't kill them, is still a mass shooting.

Including Monday's mass shooting, the Reddit list for 2013 is nearing 250 incidents. That's an average of one mass shooting almost every day.

With so many mass shootings, even those that fit the frequently used definition rarely prompt a presidential response. Perhaps it's not surprising that many of the violent acts cataloged by Reddit escape national attention.

Below, the 20-plus mass shootings that have made waves on a national scale during Obama's presidency, including the few that have been mentioned by the president himself.

Sept. 16, 2013 -- Washington -- At least 12 dead (including gunman)

A man identified as Aaron Alexis, 34, opened fire at the Navy Yard on Monday, gunning down at least 12 before being killed by authorities.

Obama addressed the incident in a live address later in the day.

""So we are confronting yet another mass shooting and today it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital,"" he said.

Speaking of the victims, he added: ""These are men and women who were going to work, doing their job, protecting all of us. They are patriots and they know the dangers of serving abroad, but today they faced unimaginable violence that they wouldn’t have expected here at home.""

I know that every time we try to talk about guns, it can reinforce stark divides. People shout at one another, which makes it impossible to listen. We mire ourselves in stalemate, which makes it impossible to get to where we need to go as a country. However, I believe that if common sense prevails, we can get beyond wedge issues and stale political debates to find a sensible, intelligent way to make the United States of America a safer, stronger place.

A national tide of grief had prompted new attacks on his group and a White House push for more gun control measures, while Mr. LaPierre — who had called for armed guards in every school — was pilloried as a “gun nut” on the cover of The New York Post.

“I don’t know why the N.R.A. or the Second Amendment and lawful gun owners have to somehow end up in a story every time some crazy person goes off and kills children,” he complained to Cleta Mitchell, a board member, who says Mr. LaPierre was “horrified” by the deaths and “insanely angry” that he and the N.R.A. were being blamed.

“These people are out to get us and the Second Amendment,” she recalls him telling the board, “and we’re not going to let them.”

Now, as the Senate takes up gun control measures, the no-compromise strategy Mr. LaPierre has honed over his 35 years with the association is facing its most difficult test in decades.

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is calling for a review of the controversial Stand Your Ground laws that were at the heart of the killing of Trayvon Martin.

""I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it -- if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than defuse potential altercations,"" Obama told reporters in a surprise press conference at the White House on Friday.

Florida was the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows an individual who feels threatened to ""stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force."" There are now about 30 states with such statutes.

George Zimmerman was recently found not guilty of second-degree murder in the killing of Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager. Police originally did not arrest Zimmerman for six weeks because of Stand Your Ground.

Although Zimmerman's defense team did not invoke a Stand Your Ground defense, it was still central to the trial and read to the jury as part of its instructions.

""If we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms, even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?"" asked Obama on Friday.

""And for those who resist that idea, that we should think about something like these 'Stand Your Ground' laws, I just ask people to consider if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws,"" he added.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also announced on Friday that his Senate judiciary subcommittee will hold a hearing on such laws in September. It will delve into how these laws and racial profiling mix and the role of the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council in pushing these statutes nationwide. In May, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission voted to launch an investigation into whether Stand Your Ground laws have a racial bias.

A June 2012 study by the Tampa Bay Times found that in Florida, defendants who cited the Stand Your Ground law were more likely to prevail when the victim was black. Seventy-three percent of those who killed a black person walked away with no penalty, compared to 59 percent of those who killed a white victim."

(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden spoke Saturday about the loss of life this week at the Boston Marathon and the West, Texas fertilizer plant explosion, passionately explaining that news of one loss ""brings home immediately, vividly the moment you learned of your loss.""

After noting the deaths in Massachusetts and Texas, Biden recalled the December massacre at the Newtown, Connecticut elementary school, saying those instances showed the ""incredible resilience, heroism, commitment and love of the people who responded to these tragedies.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker']

""Whether it was a fertilizer plant in West, Texas or those folks in Boston, those innocent, innocent children who were mangled by a senseless act of terror, along with the adults who lost their lives and limbs,"" such deaths are tragic, he said at a dinner held by the Michigan Democratic Party.

After Newtown, he said the country was gripped by ""So much carnage, so much pain, so much uh – so much uh – asking of ourselves what's happened? What can we do about all of this?""

The killing there of 20 young students and six adults at the school led him to spearhead the Obama administration's gun control effort.

Biden also chastized the Republicans behind ballot access efforts last year.

""We're never going to yield to the will of the Republicans throughout this country who want to suppress ... the continued attempt to suppress the minority vote in this country, which is the single most un-American thing any party has done,"" he said. ""It is un-American to suppress the vote.

""And by the way coming out of the civil rights movement, you want to make sure folks vote, try to tell them they can't vote,"" he continued. ""Think of what it's become if you think the only way you can win is stop people from voting or making it harder."""

One thing that lawyers and reporters soon learn is not to make public predictions or big wagers on the outcome of a trial based on opening statements or the demeanor and apparent slip-ups of witnesses or the facial expressions of the defendant or how awake this or that juror may appear during crucial testimony. Good to remember that during the trial of George Zimmerman, which started out this week with the prosecution's ""fucking punks"" and the defense's lame ""knock-knock"" joke. Even with highly paid, supposedly scientific jury-selection consultants on the job, what actually turns a juror toward a particular verdict often just isn't all that clear even to the experts of various disciplines who study the intricacies of such matters.

Witnesses so far have described what they saw or think they saw 16 months ago when, against the admonition of a police dispatcher, Zimmerman followed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin into a gated community of modest townhomes, got into a confrontation with him that nobody directly witnessed the beginning or end of and finished up by shooting him dead less than a minute's walk from the residence where Martin was visiting his father's fiancée together with his father.

Jurors have seen the grim photos of Martin's body, the cheap 9mm pistol Zimmerman was legally carried concealed, and one of Zimmerman's fingerprints lifted from that gun. They've heard a police technician explain how crime scenes are preserved and documented and how Zimmerman's gun, holster and flashlight were processed along with the Skittles and can of iced tea whose purchase was the reason Martin was out walking in the drizzly February evening.

They've heard from the woman who runs the Sanford Police Department's volunteer programs discuss Zimmerman's work with the community's neighborhood watch programs and from residents who said he seemed conscientious in that role.

They've heard contradictory testimony from a few neighbors who heard or saw part of the fight that ended with Martin face down in the grass. They listened to the EMTs and police officers who were first on the scene tell how they tried to revive Martin without success. Of how one officer arrested Zimmerman at gunpoint, handcuffing and taking away his gun after Zimmerman admitted he had shot Martin. They've heard those witnesses, police and civilian alike, describe Zimmerman's appearance, his bloody, swollen nose and head lacerations, and his behavior, one saying he seemed confused, another saying he didn't. They've heard how after he was given first aid, Zimmerman refused to go to the hospital.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist and a television host on MSNBC, announced that his National Action Network will hold demonstrations and prayer vigils in 100 cities across the country on Saturday. Sharpton, who has been active in supporting Martin’s parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, made his announcement on NBC’s “Today” program.

Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted this last Saturday of murder charges in the shooting of Martin, 17, on Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford. Martin, an African American, was returning home from a convenience store where he had purchased Skittles and a drink.

Zimmerman, who is of Latino heritage, maintained that he had shot Martin in self-defense when the teenager suddenly attacked him.

Local officials accepted the self-defense claim but civil rights leaders did not and weeks of local and national demonstrations followed. A special state prosecutor was eventually appointed and Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder.

In the wake of the verdict, there have been demonstrations by thousands of people across the country. On Sunday, protests crossed geographic and demographic lines, from New York to Los Angeles, from Florida to Wisconsin, drawing anywhere from dozens to hundreds. In Chicago, about 200 people peacefully protested. In San Francisco and Los Angeles, police closed streets. Although the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, police in Los Angeles and New York have reported making arrests.

Much of the battle over the verdict and its meaning has been fought on cable television, which covered the trial in detail. In addition to Sharpton, other prominent leaders, including Benjamin T. Jealous, head of the NAACP, have called for further government action by the Department of Justice. The agency said over the weekend that it was restarting its investigation into the death of Martin to consider possible separate hate crime charges against Zimmerman.

Evidence is being evaluated by the criminal section of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office for the Middle District of Florida, the Justice Department said. A federal inquiry was begun shortly after the shooting but was delayed pending the resolution of the Florida charges.

Atty. Gen. Eric Holder is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the NAACP convention on Tuesday. The prominent civil rights group is meeting in Orlando, near Sanford.

Several prominent congressional representatives have called on the Department of Justice to look at the incident. On Monday, Reps. Charlie Rangel and Jerrold Nadler of New York will be among members of Congress holding a news conference to discuss the case.

Also a possibility is a civil suit against Zimmerman brought by the Martin family. The family’s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said again on Monday that he was considering a suit.

“We’ll be talking about all of that in the days to come,” Crump said on CNN’s New Day. “Right now, they are trying to make sense of this criminal verdict. As Sybrina Fulton said, we have to roll up our sleeves, because even though we’ve come a long way, we’ve got a long way to go to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anybody else’s child, especially after this verdict.”

President Obama and religious and civil rights leaders have urged calm in hopes of ensuring peaceful demonstrations. On Monday, pastors and officials in Sanford planned a prayer service for peace.

Michelle Obama pays her respects to the family of Hadiya Pendleton, 15, who was fatally wounded in a random shooting just days after performing in inauguration events.

She didn’t say anything, but she didn’t have to.

First lady Michelle Obama, simply by filing into a church pew on Chicago’s South Side on Saturday and mourning the killing of a smiling 15-year-old girl she had never met, spotlighted the everyday gun and gang violence plaguing the nation’s cities.

“Genocide,” one eulogist called it, lamenting that guns had “become part of our wardrobe.” Another exhorted the politicians in the pews, “Don’t give us lip service.”

The Rev. Michael Pfleger vowed, “We must become the interrupters of funeral processions seeking to bury our future.”

Since being gunned down in Chicago a week after performing with the King College Prep high school’s majorette team during President Obama’s second inaugural festivities, Hadiya Pendleton has become a national symbol for the innocence lost to senseless shootings.

A photo of a letter President Obama wrote to Pendleton's parents, as printed in the glossy obituary booklets handed out at the funeral. The text reads: ""Dear Cleopatra and Nathaniel, Michelle and I just wanted you to know how heartbroken we are to have heard about Hadiya’s passing. We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama” (Philip Rucker)

Pendleton’s killing resonated far beyond the South Side to the White House, where the Obamas drew parallels between Pendleton and their own daughters.

The first lady, who met privately with Pendleton’s family and about 30 of her classmates, did not speak at the funeral, which lasted four hours. But her appearance carried heavy political overtones, coming as the president is pressuring Congress to enact tougher gun laws.

Obama sat quietly as Pendleton was remembered as an honors student and majorette who loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss and aspired to major in pharmacology or journalism in college. She wanted to go to Harvard.

One after another, Pendleton’s teary-eyed classmates recalled their friend’s contagious smile and soft, baby voice. “She tried to tell a scary story, but no one could take her seriously,” one said.

During the inauguration, another classmate recalled, Pendleton wandered around the nation’s capital so much that she began sweating even in the chilly weather.

A week later, a gunman opened fire on Pendleton and about a dozen other teenagers while they were hanging out at a park after school. Police said Pendleton was an innocent victim likely caught in the crossfire of a gang fight.

For the Obamas, Pendleton’s death on Jan. 29 hit home. She went to school only a mile from the Obama family home. The Obamas thought about their daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11, said Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser and close friend of the Obamas.

“It’s personal for us,” Jarrett, who accompanied Michelle Obama to the funeral, said in an interview. “The first lady and I grew up in Chicago. It could have been our daughters. So, as residents of Chicago, residents of the South Side, our heart just goes out to her family. . . . We may not have known her, but she’s a part of our family, too.”

David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Obama and also a Chicagoan, said in an interview that Pendleton’s death was “a very sobering thing” to the president, who has grappled with this city’s gun violence epidemic since he represented a South Side district in the Illinois State Senate.

“She put a memorable, recognizable face on what is a grim, stubborn, dismaying problem,” Axelrod said of Pendleton.

President Obama did not travel here with his wife, but the back of a glossy funeral program included a handwritten note from him to Pendleton’s parents, Nathaniel Anthony Pendleton and Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton.

“Michelle and I just wanted you to know how heartbroken we are to have heard about Hadiya’s passing,” he wrote. “We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence. God Bless, Barack Obama.”

In Washington, Obama is urging passage of universal background checks for all gun buyers and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. He was spurred to action by the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults.

But many more people are killed on street corners in cities like Chicago and Philadelphia, something Obama often notes in his speeches about gun violence.

“There have been so many tragic deaths around the country and oftentimes the individual deaths don’t get the attention that maybe an Aurora or a Newtown gets, but the impact it has on the family is just as devastating,” Jarrett said.

Pendleton was among more than 40 people who were killed in Chicago last month alone, making it the deadliest January here in a decade.

“All those lives that were ignored, she speaks for,” Damon Stewart, Pendleton’s godfather, said in his eulogy. “She’s a representative of people across the nation who lost their lives.”

Steve Crozier, 44, a Pendleton family friend, said in an interview that elected officials should be doing more to stop the killings.

“There’s got to be a war against these guns on our streets,” Crozier said. “People say the country is too steeped in guns, but the country was steeped in slavery, too. You’ve got to have the same commitment to getting these guns off the streets.”

Although Michelle Obama did not take the pulpit, she repeatedly was referenced by others who did. “Our first lady of the United States is so gracious — and from her heart she cares,” said Pastor Courtney C. Maxwell, who officiated.

The audience of roughly 1,000 mourners held hands, sang along and swayed during a rousing rendition of “We Shall Overcome.”

Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a former Chicago Public Schools chief, sat with Jarrett and the first lady. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, both Democrats, also attended, as did the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

To Pendleton’s mother, known as Cleo, the show of dignitaries was at times overwhelming. “You kind of don’t know how to act,” she confessed.

Her remarks ranged from the jovial — “If I knew how to dance, I would. . . . We’ve got the first lady as a mother in the house” — to the serious. Of raising Hadiya, she said, “I kept her busy so she wouldn’t run into the element. I had her thinking from the time she could speak.”

As soft organ music played, members of the immediate family received communion. Floral arrangements were carried out and Pendleton’s casket was readied for burial.

At day’s end, a repast was held at the South Shore Cultural Center. On an October day 21 years earlier, Barack and Michelle Obama had their wedding reception there."

The little-known agency, the Community Relations Service, is described by the Justice Department as their ""peacemaker"" for community conflicts over race.

The protests last spring over Martin's death certainly qualified as such a conflict. But while the department claims its ""peacemaker"" agency does not ""take sides"" in such disputes, Judicial Watch said the documents and public accounts show otherwise.

""These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said.

The documents the group received -- and has since published online -- show the CRS agency filing a series of expenses incurred during the late March and early April demonstrations.

One filing from late March recorded $674 in expenses for their deployment to Sanford, Fla., to ""work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.""

That description could only apply to the Trayvon Martin killing, for which Zimmerman is currently on trial. The heated protests and national media attention helped build the pressure last year for Zimmeran's arrest -- he was not initially charged after claiming self-defense.

When reached for comment, DOJ spokesperson Dena Iverson said, ""The Community Relations Service was in Sanford, Florida fulfilling their mandated mission.""

A DOJ official also told Fox News that the unit was only in Sanford to support local efforts aimed at ""reducing tensions and the potential for violence.""

""For more than 49 years CRS has done significant work in a variety of conflicts, disputes, demonstrations and protests in communities across the country,"" the official said.

The filings by the Justice Department agency detailing their involvement are all similar. They mostly cite work on ""support"" and ""technical assistance"" for organizers and law enforcement agencies, as well as ""onsite mediation.""

Judicial Watch, in claiming the agency crossed a line by aiding the anti-Zimmerman events, points to an April 2012 article in the Orlando Sentinel.

That article detailed the role the CRS unit played during the protests. In one case, the Sentinel said they helped ""set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee.""

In another, the article said they arranged an escort for college students for a 40-mile march to ""demand justice."" One church leader was quoted as saying, ""They were there for us.""

But it's not clear from the article whether the unit's involvement crossed the line from mediation to advocacy. The article generally described their role as teaching civil-rights organizers how to manage crowds and easing tensions. An agency official said their goal was to ""build local capacity to deal with these issues.""

The Justice Department did not respond Wednesday to requests from Fox News for comment on the Judicial Watch documents.

The CRS unit was established under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

""For more than 45 years, CRS has been asked to provide its experienced mediators to help local communities resolve conflicts and disturbances relating to race, color, or national origin,"" the department says on its website.

(CNN) - It's not the first time this has happened: Students return to school after a few weeks off, and a few things have changed. Maybe the gym floor got a shine, the new physics teacher arrived - or there's an adult with a gun.

As students across the country returned to school this week, some schools implemented new security policies or brought in new personnel. Some are temporary or pilot programs. Others are refreshes of existing plans and training.

In Utah and Texas, some educators trained in shooting or self-defense. Arizona's Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio put a ""posse"" of armed volunteers around school perimeters. The National Rifle Association said all schools should immediately have armed officers, later adding that schools should decide for themselves how to protect children.

It's all in reaction to the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six staffers were killed.

“This is Columbine déjà vu,” said Kenneth Trump, a school security consultant who works with school districts across the country. For weeks he's been hearing from schools that want to review emergency plans, train staff or invest in technology they hope will increase security.

""I’m happy to see these conversations happening now,"" Trump said. ""I’m frustrated you couldn’t pay someone to have those conversations the day before Sandy Hook.""

A lot has changed for Sandy Hook students. They returned to school last week in a different building in a different town. The school was outfitted with familiar rugs and furniture - even the school's pet turtle made the move.

In his State of the State address on Wednesday, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy emotionally rejected the idea of guns in schools, whether teachers carrying weapons or guards outside every classroom.

But Sandy Hook students did return to a school with more cameras, more locks and an obvious police presence nearby.

""I think, right now, it has to be the safest school in America,"" Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said on the students' first day back.

""Right now"" is the timeline security pros struggle with. Trump expects schools to keep calling until budget decisions and new crises draw their attention.

""There’s a buzz at the local level,"" Trump said. ""The question is always going to be sustainability, a dollar cost and time cost. Are you willing to do those things?""

Next week, Schools of Thought will consider five perspectives on how to make schools safer, but for now, here are some security shifts we've heard of across the country.

Starting this fall, all incoming freshman at San Diego State University will undergo ""active shooter"" training, where students learn how to respond, fight back or set up barricades between themselves and a shooter. Other universities have used the training, too.

In Marlboro Township, New Jersey, the mayor shifted police officers to each school for at least 90 days, until they've done a full security assessment. The officers will be paid from the Board of Education's budget.

In San Antonio, the owner of a self-defense and fitness studio began to offer free self-defense classes to anybody who works for a school, CNN affiliate KENS reported.

It's not yet in place, but Arizona's attorney general proposed a plan to arm principals or another designated person. Budgets are too tight for armed school resources officers on most campuses, Attorney General Tom Horne said.

The Utah Shooting Sports Council is stepping up courses that offer free firearms training to teachers.

New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, one of the nation’s most committed and deep-pocketed gun-control proponents, is ratcheting up pressure on lawmakers by launching a new system to grade them based on their votes and statements on gun issues.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the nonprofit group financed by Bloomberg (I), will unveil a scoring system Tuesday to award lawmakers grades of A through F, much like the National Rifle Association, which has derived much of its power by deploying letter rankings against politicians at election time. The group’s strategists briefed The Washington Post on the plans ahead of Tuesday’s announcement.

“For decades, the NRA has done an admirable job of tracking to minute detail how members of Congress stand on gun bills. We’ve simply decided to do the same,” said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which is chaired by Bloomberg and is made up of more than 900 mayors from across the country.

This is Bloomberg’s latest move to establish his organization as a counterweight to the influential NRA and to create legislative momentum on Capitol Hill around President Obama’s proposals to toughen the nation’s gun laws.

Mayors Against Illegal Guns will start airing a 60-second ad on Tuesday featuring Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was killed in December’s elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn. The group is spending more than $1 million to air the ad on cable news in Washington and on television stations in 10 targeted states, officials said.

View Graphic How the NRA exerts influence over Congress

The group is targeting Sens. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Daniel Coats (R-Ind.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.).

The group also this week will begin airing a new television ad statewide in Pennsylvania focused on Toomey, who quietly has been negotiating on a compromise on expanding background checks with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). The ad highlights Toomey’s past statements in support of the idea and urges Pennsylvanians to call his office to “demand action” when a background-check bill comes up for a vote in coming days.

The group’s new ratings system would produce a scorecard for senators and representatives that could serve as a guide for voters as well as campaign donors heading into the 2014 midterm elections and in future campaign cycles.

Glaze outlined a sophisticated algorithm that would weigh lawmakers’ votes on gun bills as well as their public statements and other actions to issue overall letter grades.

“Not every member can vote for every bill, but if not, there are other things they can and should be doing, and we will have our eye out for those as well,” Glaze said.

A good grade could reward a vulnerable lawmaker for backing tougher gun laws, the thinking goes, while a poor grade would publicly shame a politician who votes against popular ideas such as universal background checks.

Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor, has said he would tap his personal fortune to finance television ad campaigns defending lawmakers who vote for gun-control measures and attacking those who do not.

Earlier this year, Bloomberg spent more than $2 million on an ad blitz for a special primary election in an Illinois congressional district to deny the seat to NRA-backed former congresswoman Debbie Halvorson, a Democrat.

The Mayors Against Illegal Guns scoring system was developed in part because major political donors who support gun control have been seeking guidance about how to direct their contributions in upcoming election cycles, Glaze said.

Some influential Democratic benefactors, including businessman Kenneth Lerer and technology entrepreneur David Bohnett, have warned publicly that they will not write another check to Senate Democrats who do not vote to expand background checks.

“The appetite for information about where members are is very high,” Glaze said. Of the scorecard, he added: “We don’t intend that this will be a tree falling in the forest. We intend for people to have all the information they need to make sound voting and political-contribution decisions.”

The grading system is most directly a threat to Democrats from conservative states such as Arkansas, Montana and North Carolina who could feel compelled to vote against some gun measures because of the large number of gun owners in their states yet rely on donations from liberal donors in places such as California and New York to fuel their campaigns.

It is too soon to know whether Bloomberg’s new and untested scorecard will have the same impact as the NRA’s. For decades, Republicans as well as Democrats from more conservative states — including Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) — have campaigned on their “A” ratings from the NRA.

“The reason NRA scorecards are effective is that they have the weight of approximately 5 million dues-paying members and tens of millions of other supporters behind them,” NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. In a dig at Bloomberg, he added, “We’ll take that over the purse of one billionaire any day of the week and twice on Sunday.”

Mayors Against Illegal Guns has been airing television ads in 10 key states for two weeks, and the results are uncertain. The group is trying to pressure lawmakers to vote for expanding background checks, but a deal in the Senate has proved elusive and many of the targeted senators have been circumspect about their positions.

“It is close to impossible to get a senator who is the subject of an ad to tell you whether it helps or it hurts,” Glaze said. “I think the proof will be in what the Senate ends up producing.”

Like pray.

“Where we see tragedy,” said NRA chief lobbyist Chris Cox, “Barack Obama and Michael Bloomberg, they see opportunity. While we pray for God to comfort those suffering unimaginable pain, they rush to microphones and cameras, gather in war rooms on Capitol Hill and scheme about how to use that suffering to push their political agenda.”

Yeah, that makes sense.

I can definitely see where praying is much more effective than trying to pass universal background checks for gun purchases, limit the size of magazines or ban assault weapons.

RELATED: Sarah Palin’s vulgar tweets: Not funny

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who once sipped on a Big Gulp during a speech to tweak soda-averse New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, delighted the NRA crowd when she threatened to open a can of chewing tobacco to protest Bloomberg’s attempts to limit cigarette displays in stores.

“The politics of emotion,” Palin said, are governing current attempts to enact common-sense gun restrictions. “It’s not just self-serving, it’s destructive,” she said. “And it must stop.”

It’s apparent that all the NRA speakers this weekend got the same talking point about using the word “emotion” against those who would limit gun rights.

“We must do everything we can to stop violent crime,” said U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). “Everyone here has been horrified by acts of violence by deranged individuals that would take the lives of the innocent among us. And yet, in terms of how you actually stop violent crime, the president is fond of using emotion, and unfortunately disregarding the facts.”

Yes, emotion. Such a terrible thing. Particularly in the world of NRA leadership, which is known for its dispassionate, intellectual approach to the gun debate. It doesn’t get more lofty than Wayne LaPierre’s post-Sandy Hook analysis: “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”

On Planet NRA, only people who love guns are allowed to act on their emotions. Everybody else, not so much.

“Second Amendment rights are personal to me,” said Palin, who explained that her youngest son’s nickname is “Trigger,” her nephew’s middle name is “Remington,” her oldest son is a combat vet. “I could go on and on about the connections there.”

I bet she could.

However, if your first-grader died in a hail of bullets in the classroom, you, and the president who agrees with you about limits on gun ownership, are expected to shut up and grieve in silence.

You can’t be trusted to understand the gun debate.

You’re too emotional.

Bloomberg the billionaire or Michael R. Bloomberg the boogeyman.

With signs that momentum for stiffer gun laws has begun to flag on Capitol Hill, the White House and gun control proponents are increasingly turning to the mogul mayor of New York to carry the fight into key congressional districts. He has bankrolled a high-profile campaign to counter the political might of the National Rifle Assn. His latest volley: a blitz of TV ads in 13 states urging lawmakers to approve expanded background check requirements.

But as the emerging voice for gun restrictions, it’s not clear whether Bloomberg will help or hurt. Many gun rights advocates believe he may be their perfect foil. They have ridiculed his effort as the latest excess from a “nanny in chief” who has forced chain restaurants in New York to post calorie counts, and who has waged fierce crusades against smoking, trans fats, salt and sugary beverages.

The White House has no qualms about Bloomberg’s role. Vice President Joe Biden has met with him twice in the last month, and President Obama offered impassioned support at the White House on Thursday for a “national day of action” called by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that Bloomberg co-chairs.

To mark the day, the group sponsored nearly 140 events in 29 states, from a petition drive in Pleasant Hill, Calif., to a candlelight vigil in Raleigh, N.C. It also launched a TV ad in Connecticut featuring grieving parents of some of the 20 first-graders who were shot to death Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

The tragedy sparked the current push for gun control, but more than 100 days later no bill has passed either house in Congress. And changes considered possible are far less ambitious than advocates initially had hoped. Lawmakers almost certainly won’t approve new bans on assault weapons or high-capacity ammunition clips.

Bloomberg thus has focused on winning support for universal background checks and stricter gun trafficking laws.

But any new limits will require support from Democrats and Republicans in conservative states with mostly rural voters — constituencies that may be suspicious of Bloomberg’s vast fortune, ambiguous politics (he’s an independent), social liberalism and eat-your-vegetables style.

Early feedback suggests Bloomberg’s pitch doesn’t play well everywhere.

“I don’t take gun advice from the Mayor of NYC. I listen to Arkansans,” Sen. Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat facing a tough reelection fight in 2014, wrote this week on Twitter.

Another red-state Democrat, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, was equally dismissive. “Frankly, there are far better uses for Mayor Bloomberg’s [money] than buying ads attacking a way of life he clearly does not understand.”

“It’s not just about guns; it’s about government overreach, and Bloomberg epitomizes that,” said a Democratic strategist from a Western state, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

The new TV ads call for background checks for nearly all gun buyers. The spots feature a flannel-clad man, a shotgun in his lap, praising responsible gun ownership from the back of a pickup truck.

The $12-million ad buy, which is running during the two-week congressional recess, targets lawmakers in Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

“The public overwhelmingly in those states support background checks on all sales,” said Bloomberg spokesman Marc La Vorgna. “If anything, the ads are going to give cover to those who vote for it because the bill is so popular.”

The group claimed one quick success. Sen. Joe Donnelly, a first-term Democrat from Indiana, told a business round table in Fort Wayne on Tuesday that he was “supportive of background checks.”

Bloomberg, who will leave office next year, does not appear in the TV spot. Other ads produced by the mayor’s group have featured law enforcement officers, retired military officials, sports stars and victims of gun violence.

But Bloomberg has not been hiding. Last fall, his “super PAC” spent more than $3 million to help defeat Rep. Joe Baca, an eight-term pro-gun Democrat facing a primary challenge in a newly drawn San Bernardino district. It was more than Baca and the winner, Gloria Negrete McLeod, spent together.

Bloomberg’s super PAC, Independence USA, spent an additional $2.2 million for anti-gun ads in a special congressional primary in Chicago last month, vaulting that race to national prominence.

In response, the NRA has showcased Bloomberg as its opponent. He popped up in the NRA’s first post-Newtown ad, a pugnacious spot assailing public figures who rely on armed security while opposing posting armed guards in all schools.

Americans “don’t want him in their restaurants; they don’t want him in their homes,” NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “They don’t want him telling them what food to eat. They sure don’t want him telling them what self-defense firearms to own.”

“The mayor has made himself an issue,” said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. “There’s no way he can run away from that. He’s made himself the sole benefactor of this crusade against the 2nd Amendment. He has also made himself the primary intimidator of senators by launching this multimillion-dollar campaign.”

Former Rep. Earl Pomeroy, a North Dakota Democrat who tangled with the NRA when he voted for the now-expired 1994 assault weapons ban, said the group was following a familiar playbook.

“The LaPierre argument is a classic straw-man approach: Shift the topic, portray the other side in an unflattering light, and talk about them instead of talking about the issue,” said Pomeroy, who lost his seat in 2010.

Bloomberg’s allies say the benefit of his advocacy — and his deep pockets — outweighs any potential backlash.

“The risk would be allowing [the] NRA to have the field to themselves, because we’ve seen what the result of that is,” said La Vorgna, Bloomberg’s spokesman.

Police chiefs attending represent Newtown%2C Conn.%3B Aurora%2C Colo.%3B and Oak Creek%2C Wis.

Meeting is part of the president%27s effort to build support for gun control plan

President says his goal is to keep guns out of the wrong hands

Lobbying Congress to pass meaningful gun control, President Obama sought Monday to build public support through local law enforcement officials -- including police chiefs from cities that saw mass killings in 2012.

""If law enforcement officials who are dealing with this stuff every single day can come to some basic consensus in terms of steps that we need to take, Congress is going to be paying attention to them,"" Obama said.

The president spoke as he and Vice President Biden met at the White House with the police chiefs of Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., and Oak Creek, Wis.

The Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown killed 20 children and six adults at an elementary school, and prompted the new gun push by Obama and Biden.

The administration's proposal calls for a renewed assault weapons ban, universal background checks and restrictions of the sizes of ammunition magazines, as well as new school safety and mental health programs.

Aurora, Colo., is the city where 12 people died in a mass shooting at a movie theater in July; Oak Creek, Wis., is the site of the Sikh temple where six people died during a shooting in August.

Obama's plan also received an endorsement Monday from another group of local officials: The U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, the current conference president, called for ""a national commitment to reduce the culture of violence, stop the easy access to guns by those who should not legally possess them, and increase access to badly needed mental health services.""

Some of the police chiefs who met with Obama were Michael Kehoe of Newtown, Daniel Oates of Aurora and John Edwards of Oak Creek.

The meeting also featured police chiefs and sheriffs from Alabama, Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Utah.

Gun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association have vowed to block Obama's gun-control proposals, calling them ineffective violations of Second Amendment rights.

Obama said he realizes the gun issue ""elicits a lot of passion,"" but the goal is to keep guns out of the wrong hands.

While Obama has issued executive orders designed to bolster the existing background check system and promote research into the causes of violence, he said that ""the only way that we're going to be able to do everything that needs to be done is with the cooperation of Congress.""

The White House meeting also featured representatives from the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the Major County Sheriffs' Association. Obama said it's important to listen to law enforcement officials at the local level because ""they are where the rubber hits the road.""

Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Janet Napolitano also attended the meeting at the White House."
http://news.yahoo.com/us-gun-debate-overlooks-daily-violence-062907426.html,,[],US gun debate overlooks daily violence,"LARGO, Maryland (AP) — Florena Carter's shattered life didn't make national news.

Her son was killed on his 28th birthday in 2009. Carter's brother pulled the trigger. Her father shot himself soon afterward.

The horrifying family tragedy became one more private story in America's plague of gun violence. That year, 9,146 other people nationwide lost their lives in shootings.

The vast majority died in the type of daily gun violence that does not grab national headlines in the same way as the December massacre of 20 young children and six teachers at an elementary school in Connecticut, or the mass shooting last July in a Colorado movie theater that killed 12 people and wounded 70.

Those attacks became the focus of a bitter national debate over guns, which culminated with the defeat in the Senate of several proposals backed by President Barack Obama to tighten gun control laws, including banning military-style assault weapons and expanding background checks to stop criminals and the mentally ill from buying firearms.

Often lost in America's divisive gun control politics are the stories of people whose urban communities suffer the most from shootings every day. Although violent crime has been declining in the United States, it still far outstrips the rate of other developed countries. FBI figures show 8,583 people were killed by guns in 2011, the last year for which numbers were available.

That is nearly 24 people a day.

The figure is far higher when counting the number of people who kill themselves with guns. The federal Centers for Disease Control listed 19,392 gun suicides in the United States in 2010, the latest figures available.

Among the hard-hit places is Prince George's County, the Washington D.C. suburb where Stefan Carter was killed by his uncle 3 1/2 years ago. The county in the state of Maryland has long suffered under a reputation for violent crime, even though the U.S. Census Bureau lists it as the wealthiest majority African-American county in the country.

Story continues

Support for gun control tends to run high in places like Prince George's County. In other parts of the country, particularly states with large rural populations, people say firearms are essential for hunting and personal safety, a right that has been protected by the Second Amendment of the Constitution for more than 200 years.

As the American frontier expanded westward, gun ownership became culturally entrenched, and for many citizens, it remains a way of life. But other Americans believe the Second Amendment, adopted in 1791, no longer makes sense in modern urban settings like Prince George's County, where shootings tear at society.

Florena Carter, a 24-year veteran police officer, has concerns about the easy access to handguns for civilians. She is convinced that simply owning a gun made her brother more likely to use it.

Her son and her brother had been out on the town celebrating Stefan's birthday. When they were heading home, she said, her son tried to stop her brother from driving because the older man was intoxicated. They fought and Carter's brother pulled a handgun and shot Stefan.

Carter was at a loss to explain how the dispute escalated. The two men had been close; neither was prone to violence, Carter said.

""All I can think is that it was the alcohol and that he had a gun,"" she said.

That argument goes counter to rhetoric often cited by U.S. gun advocates who say that gun restrictions can't stop people who are determined to misuse guns. What's more, they argue, such shootings among family members should not deny law-abiding citizens from owning guns for self-protection.

Since the Connecticut school shooting, many gun-rights activists have insisted the solution is for more people to own guns, not fewer. Politicians in some states have proposed laws allowing school teachers to carry guns, arguing that shooters will be less likely to target public places where they know people are armed. Supporters argue that restricting firearms rights will only prevent people from defending themselves from criminals who will find a way to get guns no matter what.

But in Prince George's County, Carter doesn't buy the argument that guns make people safer. Last year, she worked with a county program known as Gift Cards for Guns, which allows people to anonymously turn in their weapons in exchange for a $100 gift card.

Carter said she had not known her brother owned a handgun but was told by police that he had bought it legally.

Maryland recently passed a law that will make it tougher to buy such guns. One of the toughest gun control measures in the country, Maryland's law requires licensing, fingerprinting, and safety training to purchase a handgun, bans the sale of 45 types of assault weapons and limits ammunition magazine capacity to 10 rounds.

The National Rifle Association, the most powerful gun rights lobby in the country, is expected to challenge the Maryland statute in the courts, delaying its going into force.

Maryland is among several states that passed tougher gun control measures in response to the Connecticut school shooting, even as the push for stricter federal laws died in the Senate. Among them was Colorado, a state with a proud frontier tradition where gun ownership is common.

That has given hope to some advocates that gun control might be gaining ground despite fierce opposition by the deep-pocketed NRA, which spends heavily in U.S. elections. Although Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the Senate defeated the push for expanded background checks, polls at the time showed that about 90 percent of Americans favor such a measure.

Maryland has routinely had the 2nd highest homicide rate per 100,000 residents of all 50 states, despite also having the 5th highest per capita income. It had a gun deaths rate of 6.8 per 100,000 in 2011, more than 2 percentage points higher than the national average of 4.7 per 100,000.

That is due in large part to crime in Prince Georges County and the economically hard-hit city of Baltimore, according to the FBI and Census Bureau. Gun deaths have fallen dramatically in Prince Georges as the county government implements aggressive policies to build up the six most troubled neighborhoods, from programs to keep students in school to better street lighting, road repairs and demolition of abandoned buildings. The number of homicides has fallen from a high of 169 in 2005 to 64 last year.

Homicides are dropping similarly in other U.S. cities, prompting some to argue stricter gun measures are not needed to combat daily violence. But Prince Georges police chief Mark Magaw has welcomed Maryland's tough new gun law as a strong crime-fighting tool in his still-violent county.

So does Carter, who told her story at a gathering of other women coping with the loss of family members to gun violence. They have all been counseled by a group known as Community Advocates for Family and Youth.

Carter, now a board member of the organization, said she was still suffering despite sessions with police department psychologists when she found CAFY. Her husband had died of leukemia just five months before her son was killed.

""I thought, 'my God couldn't do that to me,'"" she said.

Carter dabbed away tears as she recalled the early December morning 3 ½ years ago when the phone rang with the news of her son's death.

""My son was my only child. I don't have any grandchildren, and now I don't have hope of any,"" she said. ""My son was two classes short of graduating with a dual degree.""

In the passing weeks, Carter said she noticed that her father appeared increasingly depressed. She figured it was a natural reaction to the tragedy — until he killed himself.

Her brother will be out of prison in about two years, serving a sentence shortened because he accepted a plea deal. Carter doesn't know if she can forgive him.

""I love my brother. I've known him longer than my son. I changed his diapers,"" she said. But when he's released, ""I just can't see us having a relationship."""

USA TODAY

President offers tributes to 12 victims of Navy Yard shooting

Tone reflects frustration over gun laws

Government shutdown%2C Iran%2C Syria just a few of the big issues on his plate

WASHINGTON — With a series of domestic and international crises coming to a head at once, President Obama made clear on Sunday that he won't be pouring a great deal of his own political capital into reigniting the debate on the country's gun laws.

During a memorial service, the president offered warm tributes to the 12 victims of last week's mass shooting at the Navy Yard.

But his tone also had an edge of frustration that was absent from his December remarks at the memorial honoring the victims of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the site of the last major mass shooting in the U.S. where 20 young children and their teachers were slain. There he choked back tears and set the goal — which would prove to elude him — of overhauling the nation's gun laws. In Sunday's memorial, he made clear that he's all but given up hope that he can persuade Congress.

""By now, though, it should be clear that the change we need will not come from Washington, even when tragedy strikes Washington,"" said Obama, who has gone through a withering six months in which he has fought with Republicans on gun laws, immigration and Syria and has faced fierce domestic and international criticism over a series of revelations about the National Security Agency's surveillance programs.

For Obama, the all-too-familiar moment of serving as consoler-in-chief after yet another mass shooting comes at one of the most difficult periods in his presidency — leaving him with little time, energy or political capital to re-litigate the gun issue just months after he tried and failed to push Congress to get behind a sweeping overhaul of the nation's gun laws.

Among the emerging domestic crises on his plate: The White House is pushing forward with implementation of Obama's signature health care law in the face of a Republican call for repeal; the federal government appears headed toward a shutdown at the beginning of next month; and Obama and the House GOP are at loggerheads over raising the nation's debt limit.

At the same time, Obama is trying to maintain pressure on Syria's Bashar Assad, whose regime the U.S. intelligence community deemed responsible for a chemical attack last month in his worn-torn country that left more than 1,400 dead.

The president is also trying to take advantage of a diplomatic opening — created by the installation of a new, more moderate president in Iran — to persuade Tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Obama and Iran's new president, Hasan Rouhani, will attend this week's annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.

While the White House says no meetings are scheduled between the two, the moment seems ripe for a thawing in the tense U.S.-Iran relationship. Obama has expressed cautious optimism about Rouhani, who has said he would like to resolve the nuclear issue and has taken a more conciliatory tone about the USA than his firebrand predecessor.

Adding to the president's worries, his national security team was sorting out details on Sunday of an ongoing hostage situation involving Islamic terrorists at an upscale shopping mall in Nairobi that was popular with Americans and other westerners. Three of the al-Shabab gunmen in the attack, which killed at least 68, had lived in the United States, according to news reports.

On Sunday, he bitterly noted that in other nations — including Britain and Australia — just a single mass shooting pushed lawmakers to rethink their gun laws, while lamenting the murder rate with guns is 10 times higher in the U.S. than other developed nations.

""Yet here in the United States, after the round-the-clock coverage of cable news and after the heartbreaking interviews with families, after all the speeches, and all the punditry, and all the commentary, nothing happens,"" Obama said.

In the end, Obama said it is the demands of constituents on their representatives that they make ""basic, common-sense actions to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people"" that will move the debate forward.

While Obama said he is certain that Americans care about the pain that the families of the Navy Yard are enduring, a larger question remains more difficult to answer.

""The question is do we care enough,"" he said.

From the president's perspective, the answer is likely not the one he wants to hear."

Wallace pointed out that the president's children face a larger threat than most. ""Tell that to the people at Newtown,"" LaPierre replied, referring to the town where an armed shooter killed 20 young children at an elementary school in December. ""Do you really think that the president's children are the same kind of target as every schoolchild in America?"" Wallace asked. ""It's ridiculous, and you know it, sir.""

For LaPierre to justify his abhorrent political ad by bringing up the children of Newtown is just despicable, and Chris Wallace rightly put him in his place.

LaPierre also lies about gun registry and Chris Wallace smacks him down:



He predicted a universal gun registry is next -- a measure that, as Wallace reminded him, has not been proposed. ""Forgive me, sir, but you take something that is here and you say it's going to go all the way over there,"" Wallace said. ""There's no indication -- I mean, I can understand your saying that's the threat, but there's nothing that anyone in the administration has said that indicates they're going to have a universal registry."" ""And Obamacare wasn't a tax until they needed it to be a tax,"" he said.

""well it was the supreme court that said that [Obamacare is a tax]"".

The argument that Obamacare is a tax was made, primarily, by the conservative Justice John Roberts, so LaPierre is using a conservative argument to show that Obama is a liar. My mind is officially blown at this man's insane logic. Many Kossacks have also pointed out that Obamacare has nothing to do with guns, so now he is just reduced to parroting Tea Party talking points. And look at how fast Wallace points outChris Wallace is not having this nonsense on his show! And all LaPierre can do, is ignore that statement, since he doesn't have a retort, and say ""I don't think you can trust these people."" He then tries to pivot to his talking points, but Wallace says ""forgive me sir, I'm going to conduct this interview"". Wow. Brilliant stuff!

When, Chris Wallace says that Obama ""is not taking away shotguns"", LaPierre, lies and says that the Feinstein bill does include such a clause. NO ONE is taking away shot guns or hand guns. This man is LYING.

And finally, offered without comment, since it's been beaten into the ground:



""If you limit the American public's access to semi-automatic technology, you limit their ability to survive,"" LaPierre said.

But I would also like to point out that with main stream conservatives like Chris Wallace distancing themselves from this nonsense, we may be winning the debate."

USA TODAY

Defense lawyer O%27Mara says President Obama should acknowledge Zimmerman%27s pain

Prosecutors say Zimmerman lied his way to freedom

Zimmerman was acquitted in state court but could face federal charges

SANFORD, Fla -- The prosecutors who tried to get George Zimmerman convicted believe he got away with murdering Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's lawyer says everyone -- including President Obama -- should know that Zimmerman was wrongly charged and should recognize the unjust trauma brought upon him.

Two days after Zimmerman's acquittal, lawyers from both sides, in interviews with USA TODAY, talked about the aftermath of a verdict that continues to reverberate across the nation.

Prosecutors say Zimmerman profiled, tracked down, and murdered an innocent 17 year old -- and then lied his way out of a conviction. Zimmerman's lawyer says he will seek immunity from any further legal action against his client and thinks Obama should publicly recognize the suffering endured by Zimmerman and his family.

""He (Zimmerman) called the police and then he decided to become the police,"" said State Attorney Angela Corey, adding that Zimmerman deserved to be charged with murder. ""George Zimmerman used excessive and deadly force and that's what made it a violation of Florida law.""

She added that she respects the jury's verdict.

Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said Zimmerman is prepared to legally defend himself against any actions in the future -- including the possibility of a federal civil rights prosecution and civil lawsuit.

""The FBI looked into that last year, interviewed about 40 people and not one person came up with any suggestion that George acted in a racially inappropriate way,"" O'Mara said of the federal investigation.

Zimmerman would also seek immunity from any civil lawsuits, O'Mara added.

A federal investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon is underway, and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida criminal trial, the Justice Department said Sunday in a written statement.

Attorney General Eric Holder briefly discussed the case Monday.

""We are committed to standing with the people of Sanford, with the individuals and families affected by this incident, and with our state and local partners in order to alleviate tensions, address community concerns and promote healing,"" Holder said. ""And we will never stop working to ensure that – in every case, in every circumstance and in every community – justice must be done.''

Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated townhouse community here, shot and killed Trayvon on Feb. 26, 2012, as the teen returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he shot the unarmed African-American teenager in self-defense.

A jury deliberated for more than 15 hours before finding Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter Saturday.

In a statement issued Sunday, Obama called Trayvon's death a tragedy for America but made no mention of race.

""I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,"" Obama said. ""But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.""

He called for calm and national introspection.

""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities,"" he said. ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.""

O'Mara said the president's statement should have been more fair and compassionate to Zimmerman and his family.

Obama has ""already made a couple of comments now about Trayvon Martin and I think he should have maybe focused a bit more on the fact that a fair trial was held, that justice was served, and that the Zimmerman family has gone through their own trauma in this. I don't know that it needs to be a one-sided conversation. I don't think that helps,"" O'Mara said.

Corey had this to say about when asked about Obama's statement: ""I don't have a reaction to any other public official commenting on our case. The relevant people are the jury and the people in the courtroom.""

Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda, who argued before the jury, said Zimmerman was prosecuted using the best evidence the state had.

""This is an issue about whether you are going to allow a citizen to take the law into his own hands,"" de la Rionda said. ""I prosecuted this case because you had a man who decided to make assumptions -- the assumptions turned out to be wrong and as a result a young man --a 17 year old teenager--was killed.""

The prosecutor went on saying he respects the jury's verdict, but after Zimmerman profiled Trayvon as a criminal, Zimmerman used that assumption to murder the teen.

""He (Zimmerman) called the police but he didn't just finish there,"" de la Rionda said. ""He (Zimmerman) then trailed him (Trayvon). Tracked him. Followed him and ended up confronting him.""

Meanwhile, O'Mara has continued to say the shooting, which is the subject of demonstrations nationwide, has been wrongly cast as a civil rights one.

""This verdict still has nothing to do with civil rights,"" O'Mara said. ""There's enormous evidence that my client acted in self-defense. There is no other reasonable hypothesis.""

O'Mara added, however, that had Zimmerman been black, he would never have been prosecuted.

Corey balked at the idea that race played any role in charging Zimmerman, saying her office doesn't consider the race of a defendant or victim unless the crime includes a racial motivation such as a hate crime.

""I know that in this circuit we handle every case based on the facts and the law without regard to race or gender,"" she said. ""When it comes to the race or gender or age of a victim or a defendant, unless it's legally relevant, it's not part of the filing decision.""

Instead, de la Rionda said prosecutors focused on what evidence they had and tried their best but failed.

Days later, de la Rionda said he wished he handled the case from the very night Trayvon was killed. He also said he was prepared to cross examine Zimmerman, who did not take the stand in his own defense.

Now, however, lawyers for both sides are recovering from long work days and Zimmerman is settling back into life as a free man.

People, de la Rionda said, also got a good understanding of how the American judicial system works by watching the nationally televised trial: ""It's very educational to inform the public out there of the way our system works."""

The second Boston bombing suspect is in custody. Now everyone will focus on what it all means, what ""lesson"" we can learn from the events.

""No more hurting people.""

Martin Richard was one of three innocent bystanders to die on Patriot's Day. As we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and Congress, we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or Facebook walls, but on display.

The worldwide response to that picture -- which his teacher, Rachel Moo, said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin -- has been both heart-stirring and heartbreaking. People are striving to remember and to honor, yes; even more, though, they are trying to make his words real.

Everyone killed in the Boston bombing, and during the events that flowed from it, was under 30. Martin Richard was 8 years old; how will his classmates handle their grief?

Krystle Campbell , age 29, had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother. Doctors had told Krystle's mother she had survived the blast, but they had mistaken Krystle's friend for Krystle. What must her mother and grandmother feel?

Lingzi Lu was a 23-year-old graduate student, the only child of her parents in China, who said learning of her death was ""a dagger in our hearts."" Sean Collier , 26, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun. He had been a campus policeman with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for only a little over a year, and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer.

Three days after the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the U.S. Senate defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers, something 90% of Americans want. As a result of the bombing, immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional Senate.

Every pundit and every politician feels every bit of bombast is justified.

And the children? Pictures and comments, memorials on Facebook. That's all.

""No more hurting people. Peace.""

The injured: Martin's father and older brother, Henry, escaped injury. His 6-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. Martin's mother, Denise Richard, 43, had brain surgery for a serious injury. The father, Bill Richard, 42, returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing, and a neighbor said he was pale, almost dazed, and too grief-stricken to talk.

The sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies, flowers, and stars that Richard and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon.

Jack Hart, a former state senator, told the Boston Globe that the Richards are ""pillars of the community ... a model family, who somehow always found the time to give something back.""

""Any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult, but when you know people, when it's people in your life, in your school, that's when it really hits home,""

The Boston Globe quoted a classmate of Martin's, Colin Baker, 9, who said about Martin: ""If somebody was left out, he would come say, 'Want to join my group?' He sticks up for kids.""

""It should not have happened to him,"" Colin said to the Globe.

""It should not have happened to nobody.""

As I read and hear these responses, I keep thinking, what are we -- the adults -- what are we telling the children? Do we think they don't see the hollowness behind our hallowed words? Do we think they don't know the difference between courage and cowardice?

There's a cliché: ""Perfect is the enemy of the good."" Apparently, legislation must be perfect, because even after this horror, we are still finding ways to divide people. Should suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev be treated as an enemy combatant? Did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received? Questions. Questions.

But let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives. Some will have to learn how to simply stand up again -- wounded forever.

We should hold Martin's sign in our hearts and resolve to do better. Because, with President Barack Obama, ""I'm assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.""

I, too, believe that, ""sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it.""

""When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is, Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama said.

Obama said he understands why people are so upset that George Zimmerman was found not guilty for shooting and killing Martin, an unarmed teen who was walking down the street in Sanford, Fla., in February 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman, pursued Martin for no clear reason and ultimately shot him in what he said was self-defense.

The president urged the nation to accept the court's verdict, saying the judge conducted the trial ""in a professional manner"" and that the jury had made its decision.

But in an unusually personal moment, he began talking about the broader context of the case and the need to better understand the experiences of black men in this country.

""I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,"" Obama said. ""There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.""

He went on to recount instances when he had heard ""the locks click on the doors of cars"" as he walked down the street. African-American men are used to getting into an elevator and seeing a fellow passenger ""clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off,"" he said.

""I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,"" Obama said. ""And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.""

Obama also pointed to the fact that young African-American men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, both as perpetrators of violence and as its victims. And that violence, he noted, often takes place in poor black neighborhoods that are ""born out of a very violent past in this country."" The poverty and dysfunction in those communities ""can be traced to a very difficult history,"" he said.

Obama said he's going to be thinking about what steps he can take as president in the wake of the ruling. He put forward the idea of meeting with local and state officials to come up with ways to provide more training to law enforcement on racial bias, and he also suggested that he plans to examine certain states' Stand Your Ground laws.

More generally, Obama lent support to the idea of creating a coalition -- of business leaders, elected officials, celebrities, athletes -- to address the need for African-American men to feel that they are ""a full part of this society.""

Obama's decision to speak on the verdict was a bit of a surprise. Several days had passed since it was issued on Saturday, and he had already put out an official statement. The conventional wisdom was that the president was wary of bringing more politics to an already sensitive issue. But both he and his advisers wanted to offer a bit more.

Speaking after the president finished his remarks, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the process behind putting the impromptu speech together wasn't all that complicated. The president had been prepared to address the jury verdict in Zimmerman's trial had he been asked about it in one of the interviews he did this week, but he wasn't asked. Eventually, Obama met with the press office and decided to just address the issue. A Friday statement before the press corps was as good a time as any other.

""This is not hard at all,"" said Carney. ""The president wanted to say something, and he opened the briefing today so he could say something."""

His voice wavering, Mark Mattioli wiped away tears as he recalled the day his 6-year-old son died when a man wielding an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle broke into Sandy Hook Elementary School and began shooting.

His son, James, was among the 20 children and seven adults killed by Adam Lanza on December 14 in Newtown, Connecticut – an event so horrific that it has since spawned a federal task force and kick-started a national conversation about gun control.

But unlike the handful of other parents who testified Monday at the emotionally charged hearing in Hartford, Connecticut, Mattioli said there are more than enough gun laws on the books. He called instead for a closer look at mental health policies.

Why new laws could miss America’s bigger gun problem

“I don’t care if you named it ‘James’ law,’ I don’t want (another law),” he said during the first of a series of meetings set up by a legislative task force assigned to review the state’s gun laws.

“I think there’s much more promise for a solution in identifying, researching and creating solutions along the lines of mental health.”

Connecticut’s medical examiner said he was told that Lanza, 20, had Asperger’s syndrome. Research has not shown a link between that condition and violence.

The hearing drew hundreds to the Connecticut state house and revealed the sharp divide in public opinion over what should happen next in the massacre’s aftermath.

“The time is now,” said Veronique Pozner, whose son, Noah, was also killed, referring to a strengthening of the nation’s gun laws.

Sandy Hook probe to extend until summer

With a framed photo of her slain 6-year-old propped up beside her, Pozner called on Connecticut to become “an agent for change” across the country.

During her testimony, she held up a crayon drawing that Noah once scrawled on Thanksgiving.

“I am thankful for the life I live,” he wrote.

At one point during the hearing, Neil Heslin, father of a 6-year-old boy named Jesse who was also gunned down that day, asked why the public needed assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Some people in the crowd then interrupted his statement and shouted the “Second Amendment shall not be infringed.”

“We’re not living in the Wild West. We’re not a Third World nation,” Heslin continued. “We have the strongest military in the world. We don’t need to defend our homes with weapons like that.”

Connecticut already has some of the nation’s strictest gun laws.

Gov. Dannel Malloy, a first-term Democrat, has also vowed to address the factors that led to last month’s massacre and set up a 16-member panel of experts to come up with recommendations. It includes experts who reviewed policies after mass shootings in Colorado and at Virginia Tech.

The panel must meet a March 15 deadline for its initial report, which Malloy is expected to use in drafting initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence.

Janay Mcfarlane%27s sister was at Obama%27s Chicago speech

Obama talked about gun violence and Hadiya Pendleton

Police say shooting was case of mistaken identity

CHICAGO (AP) — An 18-year-old Chicago woman was killed the same day her sister had sat on the stage behind President Obama, listening to him push for gun control legislation.

Janay Mcfarlane was shot once in the head around 11:30 p.m. Friday in North Chicago, Lake County Coroner Thomas Rudd told the Chicago Sun-Times. Mcfarlane, a mother of a 3-month-old boy, was in the Chicago suburb visiting friends and family.

North Chicago police said two people are being questioned in connection with Mcfarlane's death, but no charges have been filed.

""I really feel like somebody cut a part of my heart out,"" Angela Blakely, Mcfarlane's mother, said.

Blakely said the bullet that killed Mcfarlane was meant for a friend.

Hours earlier, Mcfarlane's 14-year-old sister was feet from Obama at Hyde Park Career Academy, where he spoke about gun violence and paid tribute to Hadiya Pendleton, the 15-year-old honor student fatally shot last month in a South Side park. Police have said it was a case of mistaken identity, and two people have been charged.

Pendleton's death was one of more than 40 homicides in Chicago in January, a total that made it the deadliest January in the city in more than a decade. Pendleton, a drum majorette, had recently performed during Obama's inauguration and the slaying happened about a mile from his Chicago home.

Blakely told the newspaper that Janay Mcfarlane had been affected by Pendleton's death.

""She always said after Hadiya Pendleton got killed, 'Momma that's so sad,'"" Blakely said. ""She was always touched by any kid that got killed. She was always touched by mothers who couldn't be there for their babies because they were gone.""

Mcfarlane was supposed to graduate from an alternative school this spring, Blakely said, and wanted to go into the culinary arts.

""I'm just really, truly just trying to process it — knowing that I'm not taking my baby home anymore,"" Blakely said."

While Giffords and her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, testified that they weren’t there as victims but as Americans, the reverse was clearly the case: as shooting victims, they have been trotted out by the left-leaning media to provide Cindy Sheehan-like “absolute moral authority.” The implication: disagree with the politics of these victims, and you don’t care enough about them.

The media coverage of Giffords’ testimony exploited Giffords’ victimhood to the hilt. But The Atlantic led the way with a picture of her “handwritten notes,” which The Atlantic labeled “pen-scrawled words … deliberate … diligent … written on a surface all too familiar to schoolchildren: binder paper.” And, The Atlantic added, “She is trapped in her injury. And few things make that point more powerfully than a piece of binder paper and a hand-scrawled message.”

The Atlantic got the photo from the Washington Post, which had put it up. Buzzfeed, too, put up the photo, quoting the Americans for Responsible Solutions Facebook page:

It will be hard. But the time is now. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you” – Like and share Gabby Giffords’ handwritten testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence. Join her and Mark Kelly by texting SOLUTIONS to 90975.

So did ThinkProgress. And Business Insider.

Except that Giffords didn’t scrawl that message. Her speech therapist did.

That doesn’t mean that Giffords doesn’t think the things that her therapist wrote. It does show, however, how far the media is willing to go in order to exploit shooting victims to further the gun control agenda.

It is Giffords’ choice to be there. It is the Democrats’ and media’s and President Obama’s choice to exploit her presence. Then again, the left has never been shy about hiding behind victims to push their politics.

She Grew Up In Nogales']","Santa Monica shooting suspect, possible motive identified, officials say","The gunman accused of killing four people in a Santa Monica shooting rampage Friday was apparently angry over his parents’ divorce and had some mental health issues in the past, a law enforcement source told The Times.

The suspect was identified by five law enforcement sources in Washington and Los Angeles as John Zawahri, in his 20s.

Other sources with knowledge of the investigation said detectives believe the shooting was sparked by a family dispute of some kind but emphasized that the investigation was still in its early stages.

The suspect’s past mental health issues occurred when he was juvenile, the law enforcement source said, but no further details were offered.

The sources all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing.

These sources said the alleged gunman’s first victims were his father and brother, whose bodies were found in a burning home.

One thing the investigators were trying to figure out is why the suspect wanted to be driven to Santa Monica College, where he was ultimately killed by police.

Police have stressed that the rampage was not a “school shooting” and that the violence occurred in many places and happened to end on the campus.

But a woman who was carjacked by the alleged gunman said he specifically asked to be taken to the college.

“You’re going to drive me to Santa Monica College and let me out,” Laura Sisk, 41, of Culver City recalled the suspect saying in an interview with The Times.

As of Saturday morning, law enforcement sources said they did not believe the college was the target.

Police were expected to hold a news conference at 1 p.m. Saturday.

The first signs of trouble came about 11:50 a.m. Friday, when gunshots rang out in the vicinity of Kansas and Yorkshire avenues, in a quiet neighborhood near the 10 Freeway.

Jerry Cunningham-Rathner had just watched her son walk out the front door of her home a few minutes earlier when she heard the shots. She rushed outside, fearing he had been hit.

Instead, looking across the street, she saw a house engulfed in flames. A man standing in front of the house was dressed all in black, with an ammunition belt around his waist and a large rifle in his hands, she said.

Advertisement

“He looked like a SWAT officer,” she said.

Firefighters later found the bodies of two men inside the house. Police sources said the men were Samir Zawahri, 55, the owner of the house and the father of the alleged gunman, and one of his adult sons.

Cunningham-Rathner looked on in horror as two cars approached. She said the man pointed his weapon at the first, a Mazda hatchback, and yelled at the driver to stop. Cunningham-Rathner said he motioned for the woman driving the second car to keep moving. When she hesitated, the man opened fire on her silver Infiniti, wounding the driver slightly.

Sisk, the driver in the first car, froze, she said. She knew President Obama was in town for an event a few miles away and thought momentarily the man might be a Secret Service agent. She quickly realized that wasn’t the case.

She begged him to take the car instead. “No. You’re driving,” he said.

Before getting into the passenger’s seat next to Sisk, witnesses said, the gunman fired several shots around the neighborhood with what authorities later said was an “AR-15-style” semiautomatic rifle.

Other than telling her where to turn, the man said little during the mile drive down Pico Boulevard toward the college campus, Sisk said. He was calm, she said.

Sisk said she was crying and shaking as she drove. The gunman reassured her. “He told me to calm down,” she said. “He said he’d let me go if I didn’t do anything stupid.”

Near Cloverfield and Pico boulevards, the gunman allegedly fired at a city bus from front to back, shattering the windows. Passengers dived to the floor for cover, said Marta Fagerstroem, a student from Sweden who was on the bus and studying for an exam.

A woman sitting in the back row was grazed in the head by a bullet, witnesses said.

“It happened so fast,” said Fagerstroem, her voice quavering. “You don’t expect this.”

Sisk said that after shooting at the bus, the gunman shouted at her to “ ‘Go! Go! Go!’ So I drove, drove, drove.”

They continued toward the campus. At a school parking lot at 20th and Pearl streets, the gunman shot two in a Ford Explorer, police said. The driver died at the scene, and the passenger was badly wounded. Shortly afterward, Sisk said, the man ordered her to let him out. After he exited, she sped down the block and then got out of her car and ran.

By that time, officers from the Santa Monica Police Department and the college’s police force had received numerous 911 calls reporting the chaos.

Advertisement

The calls took on an even sharper edge with the president in town attending an event at the same time nearby. Federal authorities were quickly made aware of the situation.

Campus police intercepted the alleged gunman on the edge of campus and exchanged gunfire with him, authorities said. They continued to trade shots as the man ran toward the school’s library and shot a woman outside the building’s entrance before disappearing inside.

Advertisement

The woman outside the library later died at a hospital.

During the rampage, five people were wounded, two seriously, police said.

The library was filled with students studying for year-end exams and the gunman “accosted” several of them, Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said, as he unleashed another barrage of bullets. Hearing the shots, panicked students ran from the building or hid in rooms and under tables.

Officers confronted the man, wounding him. They carried him outside, where he died on a sidewalk.

Advertisement

As police and rescue crews from several agencies descended on the campus, Santa Monica Airport became an impromptu staging area for helicopters ferrying in officers and waiting in case there were injured to be evacuated.

That forced a change in plan for Obama, who was scheduled to be flown by helicopter from Santa Monica Airport to Los Angeles International for departure on Air Force One. Instead, he was driven.

Advertisement

The investigation into the shooting led police to an apartment building on South Centinela Avenue in Los Angeles, where the alleged shooter was believed to have lived with his mother, sources said.

Mykel Denis, who lives in the next apartment, was questioned by police Friday afternoon. He said they asked whether he knew his two neighbors. He described the woman as “pleasant” and her son as “angry.” Court records show that Zawahri, the owner of the burned house, had divorced a woman named Randa Abdou, who now lives next door to Denis.

Advertisement

“Sounds really travel in the building and he had a very distinct voice,” Denis, 46, said of the son. “It was very low and loud. He was a very angry person.”

Denis said he would often hear the man through the walls “yelling, screaming and cursing.”

Advertisement

A few years ago, Denis said, he witnessed a particularly hostile exchange between the mother and son. As the young man screamed at his mother and stormed past Denis, Denis said he threatened to call police, and the young man replied: “Go ahead.”

Gun control. That's what it was called before Newtown. Remember how no one was talking about gun control?

Except for the NRA. They never stopped talking about it. This is from June 2012:

President Barack Obama has shown little interest in peddling a gun control agenda during his first term, but the National Rifle Association is urging its members not to let its guard down ahead of the 2012 election. In a new mailer, forwarded to us by a reader, the gun rights group lists ""Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad for the Second Amendment."" We’ve been exploring several claims on the list this week -- you can see our findings here... The NRA has taken a fragment of an unclear quote and prescribed the most far-reaching, conspiratorial conclusion. There simply isn't enough evidence for such a sweeping claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.



If Dec. 14, 2012, was, as he said, his most difficult day in the White House, one unspoken aspect of his despair was a sense of deep remorse that, in the service of political survival, in the pursuit of power, in the obsession with avoiding traps, he had given little more than perfunctory attention to the issue of gun control. In word and deed since then, he has shown more passion and resolve. Perhaps the conscience of his late mother kicked in, her idealism finally overtaking his concern that people like her were too naive. Certainly the empathy of a father with young daughters had a transformative effect.

When the president returned from consoling families of teachers and children killed in the Newtown, Conn., massacre — he wept as they handed him photos and told him stories of victim after victim — aides could see in his face the toll of absorbing the nation’s traumas. “This is what I do,” Mr. Obama told them.

Top police commanders from several of the state's cities and towns have thrown their weight behind Newtown police Chief Michael Kehoe, who inserted himself firmly into the gun-control debate last week by calling for a ban on assault weapons.

DAVID GREGORY: You don't think guns should be part of the conversation? WAYNE LAPIERRE: I think that is the one thing that we can do immediately that will immediately make our children safe. DAVID GREGORY: Is it the only thing? WAYNE LAPIERRE: Gun control, you could ban all Dianne Feinstein's, you could do whatever she wants to do with magazines, it's not going to make any kid safer. We've got to get to the real problems, the real causes. And that's what the N.R.A. is trying to do. And I think, I'll tell you this, I have people all over the country calling me saying, ""Wayne, I went to bed safer last night because I have a firearm. Don't let the media try to make this a gun issue.""

For an interesting reminder of how Newtown changed the President's priorities, check out this brief video from Bloomberg on Dec 19th, or this one, same date, with Chuck Todd, entitled Tipping Point: David Maraniss has more:So does Jodi Kantor But it wasn't just the President. All over the country, from local forums to national platforms, everyone has been talking and debating about gun violence and what to do about it. From the Danbury News-Times Because it isn't just the NRA now, the discussion has been much more thoughtful and balanced than this guy The media didn't make it a gun issue. Shooting 20 first graders multiple times each—along with the brave adults who were shot trying to protect them from being massacred—made this a gun issue. Only a gun issue? No, not by any means. But a gun issue nonetheless? Despite LaPierre's tone-deaf response, yes.

And has it mattered? Here's the headline from the Jan 18th NY Times, referring to their own poll:

Massacre Sways Public in Way Others Did Not

The massacre of children at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., appears to be profoundly swaying Americans’ views on guns, galvanizing the broadest support for stricter gun laws in about a decade, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll.

Here's an even broader view, looking specifically at the question (not all polls ask it) of making gun laws more strict:Join us below the fold as we talk more about how Newtown changed the landscape."

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)

A heavily armed shooter entered the Navy Yard in Washington on Monday and opened fire, killing at least 12 people before being shot to death by authorities.

The killings brought the horror of mass shootings back into the national spotlight, as President Barack Obama condemned the ""cowardly act"" and honored the victims during an address.

Monday's violence marked the sixth mass shooting since the one in Newtown, Conn., in December, according to some counts. It was also the first publicly recognized by Obama since the elementary school massacre, which claimed the lives of 27, including 20 children.

There have been six mass shootings over the past nine months -- and at least 20 during Obama's presidency. That may be disturbing. But some would argue even that startling figure grossly underreports the number of shooting sprees.

The growing number of mass killings over the past five years left the country in search of a term that would distinguish mass murder by gun from those using other weapons. Mass shooting has gained favor as the obvious choice. Though the FBI doesn't specifically define mass shooting, it does define mass murder, calling it a single incident in which a perpetrator kills four or more people, not including himself or herself.

The FBI defined mass murder to distinguish it from serial murder. That definition provides the basis for the unofficial definition of mass shooting that has gained use in recent years. Mother Jones explained the definition in an extensive ""Guide to Mass Shootings in America,"" writing that mass shootings typically involve a single episode in a single location, usually a public place. The Mother Jones definition of mass shooting matches the FBI definition of mass murder in that it includes single incidents that kill at least four victims.

Over on Reddit, the Guns Are Cool community has compiled a list of every mass shooting in the United States this year. The moderators of the subreddit, which doesn't actually appear to be of the belief that guns are cool, use an expanded definition of mass shooting, listing every event in which ""four or more people [including the shooter] are shot in a spree."" Under the Reddit definition, a shooting spree that wounds at least four people, but doesn't kill them, is still a mass shooting.

Including Monday's mass shooting, the Reddit list for 2013 is nearing 250 incidents. That's an average of one mass shooting almost every day.

With so many mass shootings, even those that fit the frequently used definition rarely prompt a presidential response. Perhaps it's not surprising that many of the violent acts cataloged by Reddit escape national attention.

Below, the 20-plus mass shootings that have made waves on a national scale during Obama's presidency, including the few that have been mentioned by the president himself.

Sept. 16, 2013 -- Washington -- At least 12 dead (including gunman)

A man identified as Aaron Alexis, 34, opened fire at the Navy Yard on Monday, gunning down at least 12 before being killed by authorities.

Obama addressed the incident in a live address later in the day.

""So we are confronting yet another mass shooting and today it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital,"" he said.

The information was released Monday in the most detailed account yet of the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting that left 20 first-graders and six school employees dead and galvanized calls nationwide for stricter gun control.

The report from the Connecticut state’s attorney in Danbury, Stephen Sedensky III, also gave a chilling account of shooter Adam Lanza’s downward mental spiral and of his increasingly antisocial behavior in recent years.

Among other things, it said Lanza, 20, kept a spreadsheet of mass murders, hated to be touched, and did not allow anyone — including his mother, Nancy Lanza — into his bedroom. He covered his bedroom windows with black trash bags, disliked birthdays and holidays, would not let his mother put up a Christmas tree, and made her get rid of a cat because he didn’t want it in the house.

WHO THEY WERE: Newtown shooting victims

As time went by, he only spoke to his mother via email, even though they lived together.

But the 48-page report, a summary of the police investigation that includes 78 photographs of the school and the Lanza home, does not offer a reason for Lanza’s rampage or his decision to target the school.

“The obvious question that remains is: Why did the shooter murder 27 people, including 20 children? Unfortunately that question may never be answered,” it said.

The report provided a detailed timeline of the events that Friday morning, based on interviews with witnesses, including children who survived. It delved into Lanza’s childhood and mental problems and noted that nobody considered him a threat, despite his odd behavior. Toxicology reports showed no sign of prescription medication or any other drugs or alcohol in Lanza’s system at the time of the shooting.

According to police, Lanza shot his mother sometime between 8 and 9 a.m., using a .22-caliber rifle. Someone living near the Lanzas’ home in a hilly, upscale neighborhood reported hearing “two or three” gunshots during that time.

Then Lanza got into his car and drove a few miles to the school. He parked outside the low-slung building and approached the front entrance armed with a Bushmaster rifle, a Glock 10-millimeter pistol, a Sig Sauer 9-millimeter pistol and a “large supply of ammunition,” according to the report. The doors were locked because classes had begun, so Lanza shot open the plate-glass window on the door leading into the lobby.

Wearing a hat, sunglasses, yellow earplugs and black fingerless gloves, he began strolling down the hallway. “The shooter walked normally, did not say anything, and appeared to be breathing normally,” the report said.

Lanza’s first victims were principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who were in Room 9 when they heard glass shattering and “loud banging.” They went into the hallway and quickly were shot to death, but not before Hochsprung warned a third staffer behind her, “Stay put!”

That staffer was also shot but survived. She crawled back into Room 9 and dialed 911.

By now, other staff members had taken shelter in the school’s main office. Lanza was heading toward classrooms 8 and 10, where he killed 20 children and four adults.

As the gunfire raged, staff and students hid wherever they happened to be. The staff used various ways to keep the children calm, reading to them or having them color or draw pictures.

The first 911 call was made about 9:35 a.m. Less than four minutes later, the first police arrived at the school, according to the report. Less than five minutes after that call, Lanza shot himself.

PHOTOS: Newtown school shooting

“In fewer than 11 minutes, 20 first-grade pupils and six adults had lost their lives,” the report said. It noted that all the weapons found in Lanza’s home or with him at the school had been legally purchased by his mother.

Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Adam’s father, “took care of all the shooter’s needs,” according to the report, and indicated that she didn’t work because of his condition. Nonetheless, she allowed Adam easy access to firearms, and one of the items found in their home was a check, written by Nancy Lanza to Adam and dated “Christmas Day,” with a notation that it was for him to buy himself a CZ 83 pistol.

Those who knew Adam Lanza offered varying descriptions of him including “nice” but “withdrawn” as a young boy to “antisocial” and “a loner” by high school. An acquaintance who socialized with him from 2011 to June 2012 said he was “capable of laughing, smiling and making jokes” and enjoyed nature and hiking.

Nobody said Lanza indicated a desire to be violent.

His taste in video games reflected the puzzle of his personality. Items in his bedroom and on his computer desktop included violent games, including “Grand Theft Auto” and “Battlefield,” and information on mass killings and the topic of pedophilia. But Lanza was also a huge fan of “Dance Dance Revolution,” in which a player on a platform moves his feet as directed by a video. In 2011 and until a month before the shooting, he went to a theater and played the game “most every Friday through Sunday” for up to 10 hours at a stretch.

In 2005, Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and had “significant social impairments and extreme anxiety,” the report said, but he refused medication or therapy. By 2006, Nancy Lanza noted “marked changes” in her son’s behavior. He stopped riding his bike, hiking and playing the saxophone and became more reclusive.

By November 2012, he was not speaking to her and had not left the house in three months. Nancy Lanza told friends she planned to sell the Newtown house and move to Washington so Adam could attend a special school.

On Dec. 10, four days before the shooting, Nancy Lanza told a friend that her son had bumped his head badly but that he was OK. Then she left for a planned trip to New Hampshire, after cooking some of his favorite foods for him to eat while she was gone. She returned from her trip the night of Dec. 13.

Some state and Newtown officials, as well as families, had argued against releasing even the summary of what is expected to be a much larger official police report on the crime, saying it would only dredge up painful memories just as the city braces for the anniversary of the massacre.

Relatives of slain teacher Victoria Soto said the report’s release was “yet another blow” to them.

“While others search for the answer as to why this happened, we search for the how. How can we live without Vicki? How do we celebrate Christmas without Vicki? How do we go on every day missing a piece of our family?” the family said in a statement. “Those are the questions we seek the answers for. There is nothing in the report that will answer those for us.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he hoped the report would “add momentum to the push to prevent gun violence.”

“The lessons of this report are simple,” he said. “We must improve school security, increase mental health services and require background checks for all gun purchases so we can keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous people.”

http://news.yahoo.com/conn-rifle-maker-end-aid-174057577.html,,[],"Conn., rifle maker end aid deal after killings","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Just days before 20 children and six educators were killed at a Connecticut school in December, state development officials offered the maker of the rifle used in the massacre a $1 million loan to bring new jobs to the state.

The offer, capping six months of negotiations between the Department of Economic and Community Development and Freedom Group, was dropped after private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management announced it would sell Freedom Group, manufacturer of the Bushmaster AR-15.

The deal was ended four days after the killings, according to a letter released in response to an open records request.

The Hartford Courant first reported the deal and its unraveling.

Deputy agency commissioner Ronald Angelo said Wednesday that Cerberus' announcement made the deal untenable. The announced sale led to several ""cordial, amicable"" phone conversations between the state and the company about the deal no longer being workable.

He said the killings also were a factor.

""It would be naive to think that that would not weigh on people's minds,"" he said, referring to the shooting deaths.

Freedom Group did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

In a Dec. 6 letter — eight days before the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School — the administration of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy offered a $1 million loan at 2 percent interest for 10 years to encourage Freedom Group to move its corporate headquarters to Stamford from North Carolina. The state would forgive $550,000 in exchange for the creation of 25 jobs.

Twelve days later — and four days after the massacre — the agency informed Freedom Group that the offer was withdrawn. Angelo said

Angelo said in an interview that Freedom Group approached state officials in June 2012 with a proposal to move the company's headquarters. The announcement by Cerberus that it would sell Freedom Group was ""an adverse financial condition,"" he said.

Days after the killings, investors started to avoid some of the nation's largest gun makers. Cerberus Capital Management announced it would sell the maker of the rifle used in the massacre, which it called a ""watershed event.""

Story continues

""We are investors, not statesmen or policy makers,"" Cerberus said at the time.

Stocks of other gun companies fell, and one sporting-goods chain said it would temporarily stop sales of military-style firearms.

As Malloy and Connecticut lawmakers were drafting gun control legislation, the governor wrote to manufacturers asking them to stay in the state despite what he said are differences over how to regulate firearms.

""Additionally, some of the issues related to gun violence prevention require the expertise of the manufacturing community and I welcome your involvement in crafting certain guidelines and strategies,"" Malloy wrote on March 6.

(CNN) —

Friday, President Barack Obama walked into the White House briefing room and gave the American people his thoughts on the Trayvon Martin case.

His comments were striking in their honesty and in their personal nature.

He didn’t lecture. He wasn’t angry. He was reflective. He spoke about his personal experiences, and the shared experiences of so many others. He called for respect for the process and the verdict, but used the remarks as an opportunity to help others understand why so many people were angry.

He said that 35 ago, “Trayvon Martin could have been me.”

Courtesy Mo Elleithee Mo Elleithee

He started a national conversation.

And – in the most predictable and disappointing fashion – he became a lightning rod for criticism from his political opponents. Within moments of his speech, cable news and Twitter was full of comments from the right questioning the president’s motives and words.

He was called divisive. He was accused of fanning the flames of discontent. Some said that by raising this issue, he was not being a president for everyone, just for African-Americans.

Those criticisms could not be more sad. Nor could they be more off base. Because while Obama’s comments may have been focused on some of the racial divisions we face as a nation, to me his remarks were about so much more.

They were about all of the divisions we face.

There are far too many stereotypes and bigotries that divide us on a daily basis. Far too many people of different backgrounds who feel targeted, mocked, or looked down upon by others.

Obama’s comments don’t just speak to the young black man who worries he’s being followed, or who sees other people look at him with fear. He spoke to the young Sikh-American man who is called a “terrorist” on the street or stared at with fear for wearing a turban publicly.

He spoke to the young Indian-American man, born and raised in this country, who is mocked and called a racial slur and told “welcome to America” by a U.S. senator because his skin color is a little darker.

He spoke to the servicewoman who wears our nation’s uniform but finds that the greatest threat might come from male colleagues.

He spoke to the young woman who walks down the street and feels the need to cover up because of all the eyes “checking out” her body.

He spoke to the young Hispanic-American who is assumed to be an illegal immigrant just because of his or her last name.

And yes, he spoke to the white Americans who feel fear that of being robbed when approached by a young black man.

The fact is we do still have divisions in this country based on racism. And sexism. And ageism. And more “isms” than any of us care to admit. So when the president says “Trayvon Martin could have been me,” of course that’s somewhat about race.

But not entirely.

Those misconceptions about him and the fear Martin felt that night are all too familiar to way too many Americans. Trayvon Martin could have been any of us.

Obama has been the recipient of more than his fair share of attacks. But Friday’s were – for me – some of the most disappointing I’ve witnessed since he took office.

Not everything needs to be a fight. We ought to be able to have nonpoliticized conversations about issues that are this important. Sometimes, rather than throw a punch, it might be more productive to just join the conversation.

Friday was one of those days.

And unless we have more conversations like the one the president advocates – and until we realize it’s a conversation that we all are a part of – we’ll won’t every fully get to a place where we are finally judged purely on “the content of our character.”

They named the show “Politics Nation” and positioned the nightly broadcast as a left-leaning political show focusing on national politics as a natural lead-in to “Hardball.” It was a well-orchestrated PR strategy to distance Sharpton from his controversial and odious past as a race-baiting advocate for proven liars Tawana Brawley and the antagonist in the Duke Lacrosse case.

The message was clear: Sharpton isn’t the charlatan race-baiter you’ve grown to loathe; he’s now a power player in the Democratic Party and is here to bring his unique, seasoned perspective to the national political conversation.

Oh what a difference a year makes.

These days, Politics Nation has turned into the Trayvon Martin Show as Sharpton goes right back to his roots as a sensationalist willing to advocate for any victim of a crime as long as they are the right race and the alleged perpetrator is white (or “white hispanic” in this case).

Friday night Sharpton had Trayvon Martin’s family attorney on to discuss the George Zimmerman trial scheduled to begin in 10 days. Understand that Martin’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, has no actual standing in this case as it is the state of Florida against Zimmerman in these criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, Sharpton allowed Crump to lay out the state’s case against Zimmerman with Sharpton cheering and participating in the multi-media opening and closing arguments. By the time the segment was done, Zimmerman was all but tried and convicted with the most inflammatory and defamatory language possible:

Crump: When you really think about it in the totality of circumstances, George Zimmerman as this neighborhood watch patrol volunteer going around the neighborhood with a gun on prescription medication is every parent’s worse nightmare, because God help you if he comes up to your teenage child and says ‘what are you doing around here’ and your teenager doesn’t answer the question right. Then you have a Trayvon Martin situation at your doorstep. And we can’t have that in a law-abiding society.

Hearing that un-refuted and damning narration, no jury in the world would move to acquit Zimmerman. And that’s the point. Sharpton is using his NBC News platform to set the Zimmerman case up as an open and shut case of 2nd degree murder, and if anything short of a conviction comes from the Florida jury, well, you know the reason why.

At that point, if Zimmerman is acquitted, get ready for Politics Nation to then be used to advocate for social justice and political unrest until there is “justice for Trayvon.”

NBC News might as well replace Sharpton’s microphone with a bullhorn now.

http://news.yahoo.com/newtown-report-renews-focus-role-lanzas-mom-203652944.html,,[],Newtown report renews focus on role of Lanza's mom,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — As Adam Lanza withdrew from the world into his bedroom, the only person he appeared to be close to was his mother, who cooked his favorite meals, did his laundry daily — and bonded with him over shooting and guns.

Investigators' final report on last year's school massacre in Newtown provided new insights into Nancy Lanza's home life with her troubled adult son and renewed the debate over whether she bears any responsibility for the bloodbath that began with her shooting death.

""I think that we will always be bewildered by someone who did express her concern for her son, why she sought to have him engage with firearms,"" Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said Tuesday. ""Not even those folks who oppose reasonable gun safety legislation would argue that it was a good idea to have someone who was evidencing this kind of disturbance have possession of the kinds of weapons that he had possession of.""

Adam Lanza's fascination with violence was apparent to teachers and other acquaintances, investigators said in their report. He collected materials on mass killings and kept a spreadsheet ranking of mass murders.

But his mother wasn't allowed to enter his bedroom, according to the report, and it was unclear how much she knew about his obsession.

While the details released Monday led some observers to direct their anger at her, suggesting she was more enabler than victim, others were more sympathetic.

A friend of hers, Marvin LaFontaine, said Tuesday that she did her best raising her son even though he was difficult and resisted help from others or talking about issues such as other children picking on him.

""That really frustrated her,"" LaFontaine said. ""It just wore her down to the bone.""

James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said Nancy Lanza didn't ignore her son's psychological problems and can't be blamed for his actions.

""She was a victim, not an accessory,"" he said. ""We can easily second-guess parents, and there's a lot there we can question, but the fact of the matter is many people commit horrible crimes despite the best efforts of parents, siblings and others.""

Story continues

Adam Lanza, 20, shot his mother in the head four times Dec. 14, then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School, where he killed 20 first-graders and six women with a semi-automatic rifle. He committed suicide as police arrived.

The report detailed some of the family's efforts to address the needs of a young man described as withdrawn, lacking an appreciation of other's feelings, and beset with ""significant mental health issues.""

He had evaluations of many types over the years, he was home-schooled for a period because he did not like the noise at Newtown High School, and he refused medications and behavior therapies that were suggested for him.

Some parents of other troubled young adults said they can understand what Nancy Lanza was going through.

Peggy Sinclair-Morris, a special education teacher in Midlothian, Va., said it was like the ""wild, wild West"" as she tried to find the right treatment for her 18-year-old daughter, who has an anxiety disorder and has attempted suicide several times. If your child does not have certain symptoms, she said, you can get passed around by the system.

""I feel empathy for his mom just because, like I said, you try to find the services, and when they're not available, you try to do what you have to do to help your kids,"" Sinclair-Morris said. ""Just because your son committed that horrible act doesn't mean she was a horrible mother.""

Nancy Lanza, who was divorced from Adam's father, indicated that she did not work because of her son's condition. In their spacious Newtown home, she catered to his requests, cooking to his specifications and getting rid of a cat because he did not want it in the house.

In the weeks before the massacre, she said her son hadn't gone anywhere in three months and that they would communicate only by email, even though they lived under the same roof.

She often took her son shooting at a gun range. She legally purchased all the weapons her son carried the day of the massacre, and she had written a check to buy him a pistol for Christmas.

The report said that she was concerned about her son, but that she never expressed fear that she or anyone else was in danger from him. He was never violent or threatening toward others before the attack, according to the report.

A spokesman for Lanza's father, Peter Lanza, didn't respond to a request for comment.

In addition, investigators who continue to comb the murder scene at the school in Newtown say they recovered from Adam Lanza’s body three fully loaded 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster .223 caliber rifle that he used to kill 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook. Fourteen rounds remained in the magazine that was in the Bushmaster, with one round in the chamber, indicating that Lanza would have kept on shooting if his rampage had not been interrupted by police called to the scene.

The search warrants also noted that NRA certificates for Adam Lanza and for his mother were found in their home, but the NRA in a statement Thursday denied any association with the pair. “There is no record of a member relationship between Newtown killer Adam Lanza, nor between Nancy Lanza, A. Lanza or N. Lanza with the National Rifle Association,” it said in a statement.

The shootings have prompted President Obama to launch new gun control efforts, which have led to a showdown with the NRA and others who allege that proposed restrictions on gun purchases and ownership could infringe on the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution.

“Now’s the time to turn that heartbreak into something real,” Obama said Thursday as he called on those who support reforms to speak out and challenged Congress not to get “squishy” and shy away from passing laws requiring background checks on all gun sales and banning high-capacity magazines like the ones Adam Lanza used.

“We need everybody to remember how we felt 100 days ago and make sure what we said at that time wasn’t just a bunch of platitudes,” Obama said. “Tears aren’t enough. Expressions of sympathy aren’t enough. Speeches aren’t enough. We’ve cried enough, known enough heartbreak. What we’re proposing is not radical. It’s not taking away anybody’s gun rights.”

A group formed in the aftermath of the massacre, Sandy Hook Promise, said the revelations of Lanza’s weapons collection and his actions proved that change is needed.

“The information revealed today underscores the need to turn this tragedy into transformation,” Tim Makris, co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, said in a statement. “While legislation is not the only answer, it’s time for Congress to pass sensible measures supported by the vast majority of Americans to reduce gun violence. It’s time for our Legislature to move forward with the strongest measures possible. The country is united that something must be done; our representatives should act without delay.”

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Lanza’s collection of high-capacity magazines showed the need for a ban on them.

“We knew he used 30-round magazines to do it, and that they allowed him to do maximum damage in a very short period of time,” Malloy said in a statement. “This is exactly why we need to ban high-capacity magazines and why we need to tighten our assault weapons ban. I don’t know what more we need to know before we take decisive action to prevent gun violence.”

The Sandy Hook Promise group has steered clear of demanding specific changes in the past and made clear when it was launched in January that it was not yet ready to dive into the political debate on gun control. But the chilling details of the information unveiled Thursday appeared to have pushed it further toward calling for specific changes that some Newtown parents support.

According to the investigators’ reports, Lanza had easy access to the trove of weapons, ammunition, magazines, holsters, gun guides and other material found in the home, in his vehicle and on his body, despite reports from those who knew the family that Nancy Lanza had long worried about her son’s emotional state.

WHO THEY WERE: Sandy Hook shooting victims

The gun locker in their home was unlocked when police arrived there Dec. 14, and there was no indication it had been broken into. The guns used in the shootings were all purchased by Nancy Lanza, 52, who was shot dead in her bed. “There was no indication of a struggle,” Stephen J. Sedensky III, the state’s attorney for the district of Danbury, said. A rifle was found next to her bed.

Lanza then drove his mother’s vehicle to the Sandy Hook school and “shot his way into” it, leaving a loaded 12-gauge shotgun in the passenger compartment of the car. He carried with him a Glock 10-millimeter handgun, a 9-millimeter Sig Sauer handgun, the Bushmaster and multiple rounds of ammunition.

According to the police reports, it was just five minutes from the time Lanza got into the school until he killed himself with the Glock in the second of the two classrooms he targeted.

Lanza was found dressed in military-style clothing and lying on the floor. “Numerous schoolchildren and school personnel were located deceased in the first ... classrooms located off the main hallway, adjacent to the school’s front entrance,” the report said, making clear that Lanza began firing at his victims as soon as he gained entrance to the building.

The paperwork discovered in the Lanza home indicated that Nancy Lanza, for all of her apparent concern over her son’s anti-social behavior, was not concerned about him turning violent.

The papers included a handwritten notepad with what appeared to be “to do lists” for Nancy Lanza, for Dec. 14 through Dec. 20.

The Palins became good friends with Kyle in the past two years.

Kyle, the former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper, a New York Times bestseller, was murdered on February 2 at a Texas gun range, allegedly by a former Marine suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) whom Kyle was trying to help.

In a Facebook note, Palin wrote she found it “sad to see that flags aren’t flying at half staff for this American hero” and hoped Obama “pays his respects in some gesture of condolence” for someone who “sacrificed so much to keep him and all of us safe.”

Obama has publicly acknowledged people like Sandra Fluke and famous rappers, but he is not attending Kyle’s funeral and did not issue a statement after Kyle’s death.

“We may never know to what extent Chris kept us free or how many lives he saved by his brave actions in the line of fire. But his fellow warriors know how important he was. My son Track couldn’t meet Chris when Todd and I first met him because Track was deployed to Iraq,” Palin wrote. “Then when we got to know Chris even better, our son was deployed in Afghanistan. We’ve met a lot of people in recent years, and Track has been privileged to meet them as well. But he said about Chris, ‘Mom, he’s the ONE person in the entire world I would be star-struck to meet. He’s it.'”

Palin first met Kyle during the premiere of Stephen K. Bannon’s “The Undefeated” movie in Pella, Iowa in 2011. Kyle was in charge of security for that event.

After attending the funeral, Palin suggested ways to honor and remember Kyle and, in another Facebook posting, wrote:

It was a beautiful memorial service for Chris Kyle at Cowboys Stadium this afternoon. What a celebration of a great life! All in all, is there a finer human being who has crossed the 50-yard line star in Texas than Chris Kyle? Please click on the following link for information on how we can help out the families of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. As patriotic Americans, this is a tangible way to show appreciation and support for good people. On a personal note, I thank you who’ve sent birthday greetings today, and it would be awesome if you’d join me in supporting the families of these heroes by helping them out!

The Palins got to know Kyle better when Todd Palin was on the show “Stars Earn Stripes” with Kyle. The Palins, along with the rest of the cast, spent a lot of time on set with Kyle’s family. Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history.

“God bless this great warrior,” Palin said. “Let us keep his wife and children in our prayers, and may we never forget him or his sacrifice.”

“All in all this has been a tough week, but we have seen the character of our country once more,” the president said from the White House briefing room.

The president was already facing pressure from some members of Congress to hold the suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as an enemy combatant. The president did not address these concerns in his remarks.

Obama kept his comments brief, leaving it to law enforcement to explain to the public the murky and confusing chain of events that kept Boston on edge – and in some cases on lockdown – up until Friday evening. Obama said the nation is “in debt” to police at all levels, who he said responded with “professionalism and bravery over five long days.”

As the suspect is treated and brought into custody, Obama acknowledged investigators still have much work to do and said the victims “deserve answers.” Three people died and dozens were injured in the Boston Marathon bombing Monday.

“We will determine what happened. We will investigate any association that these terrorists may have had,” Obama said.

Obama spoke after the weeklong hunt for the attackers ended with one suspect killed by police and another brought into custody late Friday.

The harrowing search for the surviving suspect lasted the entire day Friday, as law enforcement locked down several neighborhoods in the Boston suburbs – acting on a flurry of tips and going house to house looking for Tsarnaev.

Onlookers broke out in applause after the suspect was taken away in an ambulance, following a tense police standoff. His older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during a chaotic chase and confrontation overnight after they allegedly killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer and carjacked an SUV.

The surviving brother is said to be injured and is being treated at a local hospital. Authorities will now ramp up the effort to determine whether the brothers were part of a broader plot and whether either or both of them got overseas training. The radicalized Muslims are said to be ethnic Chechens from Dagestan, a Russian region that borders Chechnya.

Obama did not reveal much additional detail in his remarks. But lawmakers made clear that in the weeks ahead, they will have questions for the administration about what could have led to the attack and how such a deadly assault can be prevented in the future. Chechnya is known for containing a virulent element of Islamic radicalism, but to date the region – which for years has been fighting Russia for independence – has not been known to have an interest in exporting terror to America.

“While we have made it more difficult for terrorists to carry out attacks from overseas, the attack on the Boston Marathon is indicative of the shift in terrorists' tactics in recent years to inspire people who are living in the United States to strike,” Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement. “While several plots of this nature have been thwarted, this is the first to succeed. … In the coming weeks the Homeland Security Committee will begin to ask how this happened, and how we can prevent it from happening again.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., both argued that the suspect should be held as an “enemy combatant” for intelligence gathering purposes. In a statement, they said “the last thing we should want is for him to remain silent.” They said he could be held as a combatant “not entitled to Miranda warnings.”

There are a host of unanswered questions about the suspects’ motivations and possible training.

Fox News has learned that the older brother traveled to Russia, including Chechnya, in early 2012 and returned in July. His suspected YouTube site, which included radical jihadi videos, was launched the following month.

The FBI also acknowledged that they were asked to look into the older brother by a foreign government two years ago over his possible extremist ties. The FBI said they fully “scrubbed” him and interviewed him but “did not find anything.”"

ABC News is is reporting that his attorneys have dropped their strategy to seek dismissal of the case at an immunity hearing set for April. Zimmerman was expected to cite Florida's Stand Your Ground law at the hearing which, if successful, would have immediately set Zimmerman free.



George Zimmerman's attorneys stunned court observers today by deciding to skip a ""Stand Your Ground"" hearing slated for April that might have led to a dismissal of the charges in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. Under Florida's Stand Your Ground law, Zimmerman is entitled to immunity and if he can prove he shot and killed Martin Feb. 26, 2012 self defense. If self defense was determined, all criminal proceedings would have immediately stopped, and Zimmerman would have walked free. But Zimmerman's legal team also risked the possibility that the judge would reject the motion and the hearing would give prosecutors an opportunity to pick apart Zimmerman's testimony.

O’Mara said outside Seminole County Courthouse on Tuesday that Zimmerman believes it would be a better outcome to be found not guilty of murdering Martin, rather than being granted immunity, WESH reported. ""George wants a jury of his peers to decide the case. It’s going to be, I think, a more accepted result for everyone who has to result that he gets an acquittal at trial even more so than immunity hearing by a judge.""

Vincent said that releasing the court dates doesn’t waive any rights Zimmerman has to have an immunity hearing, and indeed the defense may raise “Stand Your Ground” claims at trial. In addition, Zimmerman could seek immunity from civil claims at a later date. “By entertaining the option of not having an immunity hearing before trial, George preserves the option of having a civil immunity hearing should he need it in the future,” Vincent said.

His attorneys indicated they will still pursue a self-defense strategy, possibly citing Stand Your Ground at trial. They also left open the possibility that they may request a Stand Your Ground hearing at a later date. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he believes that his client has a better shot of being acquitted in a jury trial than he does being granted immunity by a judge.A spokesman for Zimmerman’s defense team, Sean Vincent spoke with NBC News and indicated Zimmerman may still seek immunity at a civil hearing if the need arises.So the saga continues in the pursuit of justice for Trayvon Martin."

On the way back to his car, Acree, a pastor, spotted a television in the lobby of the parking garage. A crowd had gathered in front, as if “watching the football game,” Acree said. President Obama was speaking.

In his first comments since a six-woman jury acquitted George Zimmerman of murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, Obama spoke frankly and reflectively, relating his experiences with race and racial profiling. “Trayvon Martin could have been me,” the president said.

Obama’s earnest words moved Acree almost to tears.

“I just think that the president’s words may help whites across the nation at least understand us,” Acree said. “And be a little bit more emphathetic toward our actions tomorrow.”

Acree chairs the board of a social justice group in Chicago called the Leader’s Network, which is helping organize Saturday’s vigil.

The 100-city “Justice for Trayvon” vigils, which the Rev. Al Sharpton announced Tuesday on the steps of the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., will be staged mostly at federal court buildings across the country. In California, rallies are scheduled in Los Angeles, Oakland, Palmdale, Riverside, Sacramento, San Francisco and the Monterey County city of Seaside.

Trayvon Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, and Martin’s brother, Jahvaris, will attend a rally in New York City, along with Sharpton. Martin’s father, Tracy Martin, is attending a vigil in Miami.

With the vigils, organizers are hoping to build momentum for the filing of federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

A day after the jury delivered a not-guilty verdict, Sharpton’s civil rights organization, the National Action Network, held a conference call with local organizers.

Earl S. Wagner, a minister with the Ordinary People Society in Montgomery, Ala., was on the call. He listened as Sharpton emphasized that the Trayvon Martin case was “a federal civil rights issue, and that we need to bring that light to the public.”

“It’s no longer a states’ rights issue,” Wagner said. “It’s very important that we stand together.”

He added: “This is not just a racial thing. This a civil rights thing.”

The Montgomery rally, scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. at the U.S. Federal Courthouse, was organized in conjunction with the NAACP local chapter and students from Alabama State University, a historically black institution, Wagner said.

Organizers plan to start off with a call for the Department of Justice to determine whether federal prosecutors will file civil rights charges. From there, the rally will turn into a march to the state Capitol, where speakers will address the crowds.

Wagner said city and law enforcement officials have stood “wholeheartedly” behind the efforts of organizers.

“Alabama, in particular Montgomery, is the cradle of the civil rights movement,” Wagner said. “It’s very important we continue to help make this into a national movement.”

He added that he would be “very happy” if 300 people showed up, though some rumors were numbering the expected turnout at more than 1,000.

Organizers said it’s tough to guess at the expected turnout in each city.

“We have no idea at this point,” Lawanna Gelzer, a spokeswoman for the rally in Orlando, Fla., told the Los Angeles Times. “The more people find out about it, the more it’s advertised, the more people will show up just to hear.”

In Orlando, organizers made parking arrangements and told attendees to bring chairs. Signs are allowed, but no sticks.

Gelzer said the rally at the city’s U.S. Federal Courthouse will open up with a vigil, followed by a discussion of other cases where the “stand your ground” law came into play – particularly the case of Marissa Alexander, a Florida mother of three who was denied a “stand your ground” hearing and sentenced to 20 years in prison after she fired a shot at a wall of her Jacksonville home during an argument with her abusive husband. Zimmerman waived his right for a “stand your ground” hearing, but his attorneys said he acted in self defense.

Gelzer said rally-goers plan to call for a constitutional amendment to repeal the law -- a sentiment recently echoed by Democratic leaders in the Florida Legislature.

Thursday evening, Florida Gov. Rick Scott met with a group of young protesters called the Dream Defenders, who took over Scott’s office three days earlier. The protesters were demanding that Scott call a special session of the Legislature to repeal the “Stand Your Ground” Law.

Scott refused the demands. But he issued a proclamation declaring Sunday a “day of prayer” for Florida.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/30/gabrielle-giffords-gun-violence-hearing_n_2581549.html,2013-01-30 00:00:00,"['Politics Reporter', 'The Huffington Post']",Gabrielle Giffords At Gun Violence Hearing: 'Be Bold And Courageous' (VIDEO),"WASHINGTON — She uttered just 80 halting words. But her presence was powerful.

Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, shot in the head by a Tucson gunman in 2011, opened the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on gun violence in dramatic fashion Wednesday.

""OK,"" she began, steeling herself before a packed yet hushed committee room.

""Speaking is difficult,"" she continued, pronouncing each syllable with deliberation.

This former congresswoman, once blessed with a politician's easy gift of gab, spoke in a high pitch, her voice almost childlike.

""I need to say something important. Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something.

""It will be hard, but the time is now. You must act. Be bold, be courageous, Americans are counting on you.""

Giffords, her every movement labored, punctuated her conclusion by raising a clenched fist to her chest.

And that was it.

Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, gently guided her from the table, then returned to fill out the picture.

""Gabby's gift for speech is a distant memory,"" Kelly said. ""She struggles to walk and she is partially blind. And a year ago, she left a job she loves, serving the people of Arizona.""

Giffords' appearance at the witness table offered rare insight into her condition. Her family has closely guarded her privacy and the details of her impairment.

Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida told CNN it takes her good friend ""a tremendous amount of rehearsal and practice"" to utter even a few sentences.

""What she did today was remarkable,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""You could hear the emotion and the power behind the statement she was making because she feels so strongly about this.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was looking forward to seeing Giffords and Kelly later Wednesday, and that everyone at the White House was heartened by her appearance on Capitol Hill.

Giffords has made only a few public appearances and interviews since the January 2011 shooting, including reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democratic National Convention and casting a single vote in August 2011 on legislation to raise the federal debt limit.

She resigned her seat in Congress a year ago to focus on her recovery. Giffords and Kelly, both gun owners, have formed a political action group called Americans for Responsible Solutions, aimed at promoting gun restrictions.

Gun control is an issue that really hasn't been debated in Congress for more than 10 years. It rarely gets an airing and engenders strong emotions.

And so it was that both sides did their all to ensure maximum impact from Wednesday's hearing.

Giffords was clearly happy to do her part."
http://news.yahoo.com/despite-outcry-stand-ground-law-repeals-unlikely-154400836.html,,[],"Despite outcry, stand-ground law repeals unlikely","MIAMI (AP) — Despite an outcry from civil rights groups, a call for close examination by President Barack Obama and even a 1960s-style sit-in at the Florida governor's office, the jury's verdict that George Zimmerman was justified in shooting unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin is unlikely to spur change to any of the nation's stand-your-ground self-defense laws.

""I support stand your ground,"" Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said last week.

""I do not see any reason to change it,"" said Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, also a Republican.

At least 21 states have laws similar to that in Florida, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Many are conservative and lean toward laws that defend gun owners' rights. So far, there does not appear to be an appetite in Florida or other states to repeal or change the laws, which generally eliminate a person's duty to retreat in the face of a serious physical threat. In fact, some states are moving in the opposite direction.

""The debate about stand-your-ground laws largely reproduces existing divisions in American politics, particularly between blacks and whites and between Democrats and Republicans,"" said John Sides, associate professor of political science at George Washington University.

Zimmerman, a 29-year-old former neighborhood watch volunteer, was acquitted this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 shooting of 17-year-old Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin only after the African-American teenager physically attacked him; Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, racially profiled Martin as a potential criminal and wrongly followed him.

Zimmerman's lawyers decided not to pursue a pretrial immunity hearing allowed by Florida's stand-your-ground law. But jurors were told in final instructions by Circuit Judge Debra Nelson that they should acquit Zimmerman if they found ""he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary.""

Story continues

Before the stand-your-ground law was passed in 2005, the instruction would have read that Zimmerman ""cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force.""

Since the law was enacted, justifiable homicides in Florida have risen from an annual average of 13.2 between 2001 and 2005 to an average of 42 between 2006 and 2012, including a record 66 in 2012, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. FBI data have shown similar increases in some states that enacted similar laws, such as Texas, while others haven't seen an uptick.

Beyond Florida, these states have some form of a stand-your-ground law, according to the national group: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.

Attorney General Eric Holder, in a speech last week to the NAACP convention in Orlando, said the Martin shooting demonstrates a need to re-examine stand-your-ground laws nationwide. He said they ""senselessly expand the concept of self-defense"" and increase the possibility of deadly confrontations.

On Friday, Obama said the nation needed to do some ""soul-searching."" He questioned whether a law could really promote peace and security if it sent a message that someone who is armed ""has the right to use those firearms even if there is a way for them to exit from a situation.""

Civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, said they would push for repeal of the laws, starting in Florida, where a group of young protesters occupied GOP Gov. Rick Scott's office demanding change.

""If we can do it in Florida, we can affect other states,"" Sharpton said last week.

On Saturday, Sharpton's National Action Network organized ""Justice for Trayvon"" rallies in more than 100 cities. In addition to pushing for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, the rallies attacked stand-your-ground laws.

""By standing his ground, George Zimmerman was able to get away with murdering a 17-year-old black man,"" said Chelsea Jones, a student who spoke at a Dallas rally. ""I can only imagine what the black community can achieve by standing their ground.""

Even entertainer Stevie Wonder has joined the outcry, vowing not to perform in Florida as long as stand-your-ground remains on the books. Sharpton suggested that the law's opponents might boycott Florida orange juice, and other groups want a boycott on the state's tourist destinations, both multibillion-dollar industries.

Florida state Sen. Chris Smith, a Fort Lauderdale Democrat, said the Zimmerman verdict was a ""wakeup call"" that should at least open fresh debate on stand-your-ground laws.

He noted that in the wake of the 2011 acquittal of Casey Anthony in the killing of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, Florida lawmakers passed legislation making it a felony for a parent or guardian to fail to report a missing child within 36 hours. Caylee's disappearance was not reported for 31 days.

""We are calling for the same type of action,"" Smith said.

But The Associated Press has found scant support for repeal of the laws in Florida and elsewhere. Scott told reporters Thursday that he agreed with the findings of a task force he appointed on the subject after Martin's shooting, which recommended no changes to the stand-your-ground law. Of the protesters in his Capitol office, Scott said, ""I think it is great that people are exercising their voices.""

After Holder's speech, the National Rifle Association, which strongly backs stand-your-ground laws and holds great sway in many state legislatures, issued a statement claiming that Obama's administration was aiming more at the broader political goal of restricting gun rights.

""The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept, it's a fundamental human right,"" said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. ""To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable.""

In fact, in states with stand-your-ground laws similar to Florida's, the trend has been toward greater gun rights. In Oklahoma, for example, lawmakers in 2012 passed an ""open-carry"" measure that allows people with a concealed carry permit to now display their handguns openly in a holster. Other states have sought to expand what are known as ""castle doctrine"" laws — the right to defend one's self with deadly force in the home — to apply to businesses.

New Hampshire lawmakers this year considered repealing the state's-stand-your ground law, which was enacted in 2011 by a Republican Legislature over a Democratic governor's veto. After narrowly passing the Democratic-led House in March, the bill died in the Republican-led Senate.

Holder also announced this week that the Justice Department would investigate whether Zimmerman could be charged under federal civil rights laws, which would require evidence that he harbored racial animosity against Martin. Most legal experts say that will be a difficult charge to bring, leaving Martin's supporters to concentrate on trying to change stand-your-ground laws.

Republican Sen. John McCain joined the call on stand-your-ground laws Sunday, urging state legislatures to review their statutes — including the one in his home state of Arizona.

""I'm confident that the members of the Arizona legislature will ... because it is a very controversial legislation,"" he said on CNN.

Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, appeared Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and called the laws ""one of the things that has incited and ignited, I believe, this movement across the nation, which I think is the beginning of a new civil rights movement.""

Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said during the show that the question now is whether it's proper for the federal government to tell states with stand-your-ground laws how to change or remake them. His answer: ""No. I mean, this is something that's going to have to be worked out state by state.""

Charles Ogletree, a Harvard Law School professor who taught both Barack and Michelle Obama, agreed: ""The reality is that this is not a federal issue. This is a state issue.""

(CNN) —

For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school.

The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults.

As shots rang out, Richie’s teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing.

When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed.

Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises.

Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope

But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy.

“We think it’s good he’s going back,” Wilford said. “If I leave my child anywhere, I’m leaving a piece of my heart, so it’s difficult to leave him.”

’I think I’ll be OK,’ Sandy Hook student says after first day

But Richie apparently isn’t afraid and says he’s looking forward to seeing his friends, she said.

They won’t be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school.

Instead, Richie and his classmates are expected to travel to Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby town of Monroe, where a green-and-white banner greeting the children hangs on a fence.

Survivor’s attorney withdraws lawsuit

Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school.

I think right now it has to be the safest school in America. Monroe Police Lt. Keith White

“(We want) to have as much (of) a normal routine as possible,” she said. “(Thursday) is a regular schedule, and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids.”

The school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at Sandy Hook to help ease the transition for students. Even the school’s pet turtle was relocated, Robinson said.

Security measures have also been increased, with a new system incorporating more cameras and locks, according to Jim Agostine, superintendent of Monroe Public Schools.

“I think right now it has to be the safest school in America,” Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said.

Destini's sister, Janay McFarlane, 18, was the victim of the very thing that the President was condemning at Hyde Park Academy in Chicago.



McFarlane, of the 8900 block of South Lowe Avenue, was visiting friends and family in North Chicago when she was shot on her way to a store in the northern suburb, her family said.



She was pronounced dead at 11:30 p.m., shortly after suffering a single gunshot wound to her head, according to the Lake County Coroner's office.



North Chicago Police officials did not return calls for comment Saturday.



Angela Blakely, the mother of both girls, said that the family had been anticipating the President's visit to the school where Destini is a freshman.



Leading up to the visit, McFarlane frequently mentioned the recent death of Hadiya Pendleton, 15, whose own shooting death a mile from the Obama's home spurred the President's visit.



""It's terrible, it's terrible the only thing I can remember is my daughter telling me, 'Mommy, it's so sad about Hadiya. That makes no sense,'"" Blakely said. ""She always asked me a lot of questions about death.""



Blakely said that McFarlane was still trying to make sense of the violence that claimed Pendleton's life. She kept questioning why someone so innocent could die from violence.



McFarlane, who attended Hyde Park Academy before she became pregnant with her son Jayden — 3-months-old — later transferred to an alternative school and was set to graduate in June. She was excited that her younger sister was able to attend Obama's speech.



Destini said that during the days before the President arrived to Chicago, her sister would come by and talk to her about the visit. Destini said she last spoke to her sister on Thursday night before the younger girl went to sleep.



""She was like 'Just tell me how it's going to be.' She was excited for me,"" said Destini. "" (The violence) was really wracking her because she was talking to my momma about Hadiya.""



Destini said she was sitting on a bench about two rows behind the President on stage listening as he spoke about gun violence.



""I could relate to it because that's been happening to a lot of people,"" said Destini.



The speech resonated even more when her family got the call from McFarlane's father in North Chicago, who told Destini that her sister was dead, she said.



""It was like real painful,"" said Destini, her voice choking back tears.



Since President Obama's speech on Friday, two people have been killed and six injured by guns in Chicago.

President offers tributes to 12 victims of Navy Yard shooting

Tone reflects frustration over gun laws

Government shutdown%2C Iran%2C Syria just a few of the big issues on his plate

WASHINGTON — With a series of domestic and international crises coming to a head at once, President Obama made clear on Sunday that he won't be pouring a great deal of his own political capital into reigniting the debate on the country's gun laws.

During a memorial service, the president offered warm tributes to the 12 victims of last week's mass shooting at the Navy Yard.

But his tone also had an edge of frustration that was absent from his December remarks at the memorial honoring the victims of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the site of the last major mass shooting in the U.S. where 20 young children and their teachers were slain. There he choked back tears and set the goal — which would prove to elude him — of overhauling the nation's gun laws. In Sunday's memorial, he made clear that he's all but given up hope that he can persuade Congress.

""By now, though, it should be clear that the change we need will not come from Washington, even when tragedy strikes Washington,"" said Obama, who has gone through a withering six months in which he has fought with Republicans on gun laws, immigration and Syria and has faced fierce domestic and international criticism over a series of revelations about the National Security Agency's surveillance programs.

For Obama, the all-too-familiar moment of serving as consoler-in-chief after yet another mass shooting comes at one of the most difficult periods in his presidency — leaving him with little time, energy or political capital to re-litigate the gun issue just months after he tried and failed to push Congress to get behind a sweeping overhaul of the nation's gun laws.

Among the emerging domestic crises on his plate: The White House is pushing forward with implementation of Obama's signature health care law in the face of a Republican call for repeal; the federal government appears headed toward a shutdown at the beginning of next month; and Obama and the House GOP are at loggerheads over raising the nation's debt limit.

At the same time, Obama is trying to maintain pressure on Syria's Bashar Assad, whose regime the U.S. intelligence community deemed responsible for a chemical attack last month in his worn-torn country that left more than 1,400 dead.

The president is also trying to take advantage of a diplomatic opening — created by the installation of a new, more moderate president in Iran — to persuade Tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Obama and Iran's new president, Hasan Rouhani, will attend this week's annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.

While the White House says no meetings are scheduled between the two, the moment seems ripe for a thawing in the tense U.S.-Iran relationship. Obama has expressed cautious optimism about Rouhani, who has said he would like to resolve the nuclear issue and has taken a more conciliatory tone about the USA than his firebrand predecessor.

Adding to the president's worries, his national security team was sorting out details on Sunday of an ongoing hostage situation involving Islamic terrorists at an upscale shopping mall in Nairobi that was popular with Americans and other westerners. Three of the al-Shabab gunmen in the attack, which killed at least 68, had lived in the United States, according to news reports.

On Sunday, he bitterly noted that in other nations — including Britain and Australia — just a single mass shooting pushed lawmakers to rethink their gun laws, while lamenting the murder rate with guns is 10 times higher in the U.S. than other developed nations.

""Yet here in the United States, after the round-the-clock coverage of cable news and after the heartbreaking interviews with families, after all the speeches, and all the punditry, and all the commentary, nothing happens,"" Obama said.

In the end, Obama said it is the demands of constituents on their representatives that they make ""basic, common-sense actions to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people"" that will move the debate forward.

While Obama said he is certain that Americans care about the pain that the families of the Navy Yard are enduring, a larger question remains more difficult to answer.

""The question is do we care enough,"" he said.

From the president's perspective, the answer is likely not the one he wants to hear."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/01/1182767/-GunFAIL-III,2013-02-01 00:00:00,"['Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags', 'Showtags Popular_Tags']",GunFAIL III,"First, we'll take care of some old business from prior to this week. Often, reports of shooting incidents that qualify for GunFAIL don't come out right away, but turn up a week or so later. Earlier in this series, I was keeping things strictly in chronological order, and adding updates to earlier posts when I found late-breaking reports. But slipping those reports into lists that have already been read by 90+% of the people who read them tends to understate their impact. If you're interested in these incidents and the number of them that are found, you should see every one of them as I find them. So although I'll still present each installment in the series in chronological order, I won't be updating old posts with new finds.

Second, I'm going to separate out the suicides and murder-suicides from the rest of these incidents. Although they do in many cases represent that sub-category of GunFAIL I sometimes tag on Twitter as #protectingthefamily—that is, the idea that guns bought to protect the family often end up killing the family—these incidents are hard to classify based on little more than the news reports, which are often sketchy.

Third, I'm not entirely sure what to do with domestic situations that involve guns, but don't involve suicides. What about straight-up assaults or murders? What should I do with incidents where a domestic partner might have purchased a gun for protecting the home, only to end up using it to kill his or her partner? Isn't that a mission failure of some kind? If so, where does it belong?

All of which brings me to another point. The more of these stories I collect, the more I realize how difficult it sometimes can be to categorize them. What do I do with a suicide committed with a gun not owned by the victim? That doesn't fit in the category of family deaths caused by a gun purchased to protect them. And what if a murder-suicide is committed between terminally ill, elderly spouses? Does it fit the category? It hardly seems sensitive to include them, of course. But it also might not really be very telling about the way guns get used. Or maybe it is. But one thing is for sure, it has made me more acutely aware of the difficulties gun rights advocates point out with things like defining ""assault weapons,"" or listing ""legitimate"" reasons to have certain types of guns, or certain modes of employing them. If there are ways of killing yourself or your family with guns that confound the notion of #GunFAIL, then surely there are things I haven't thought of in terms of justifiable uses, reasons for ownership, etc.

With that thought out of the way, let's begin with the GunFAIL report, below the fold."
http://news.yahoo.com/colo-corrections-dept-chief-shot-killed-home-125559935.html,,[],"Colo. Corrections Dept. chief shot, killed at home","MONUMENT, Colo. (AP) — In the weeks before Colorado's top prisons official was fatally shot after answering his front door, he carried out a variety of functions including requesting execution chemicals and speaking to legislators about security issues.

It's unknown what role Tom Clements' position as executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections might have played in the shooting Tuesday, but investigators said they aren't ruling out any possible motives, including whether it was random or a work-related attack.

Colorado corrections spokeswoman Adrienne Jacobson would not comment on whether Clements had security at his home. Security was stepped up for other state officials, including Gov. John Hickenlooper, who was ashen-faced as he addressed reporters at the Capitol before signing bills placing new restrictions on firearms.

""Tom Clements dedicated his life to being a public servant, to making our state a better place and he is going to be deeply, deeply missed,"" Hickenlooper said Wednesday.

Authorities are looking for a late-model car, possibly a Lincoln or a Cadillac, that a neighbor spotted outside Clements' home around the time of the shooting Tuesday, El Paso County Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Jeff Kramer said in a report carried by the Denver Post.

Kramer also said investigators want to speak with a woman seen speed-walking near Clements' home not long before the shooting because she may have seen the suspect. The woman was wearing light pants, a dark windbreaker and possibly a hat.

While small in numbers, similar attacks on officials have been increasing in the U.S. in recent years, said Glenn McGovern, an investigator with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's office in California who tracks such incidents worldwide. He said there have been roughly as many in the past three years — at least 35 — as the entire prior decade. Revenge is usually the motive, he added.

""It's often taking place away from the office, which makes sense, because everyone's hardening up their facilities,"" he said, adding that he advises prosecutors to constantly assess the safety of their residences.

Story continues

On Jan. 31, Texas prosecutor Mark Hasse was gunned down as he left his car in the parking lot to the county courthouse. McGovern also counts the rampage by an ex-Los Angeles police officer who killed the daughter of a retired city police officer as part of a plot to avenge his firing.

In Colorado, a prosecutor was fatally shot in 2008 as he returned to his Denver home. In 2001, federal prosecutor Thomas Wales was fatally shot by a rifleman while he worked on a computer at night in his Seattle home. Both cases remain unsolved.

Attacks on legal officials are still extremely rare, said Scott Burns of the National District Attorneys Association, which counts 11 prosecutors as having been slain in the last 50 years. But he acknowledged that legal officials are vulnerable outside of protected offices and courthouses.

""If someone wants to truly harm or kill them, it's very difficult, frankly. There's not a lot we can do,"" he said.

Mike McLelland, the district attorney in rural Kaufman county east of Dallas, is a 23-year military veteran. Since his prosecutor, Hasse, was killed on his way into the office, McLelland has warned his staff to be vigilant about their surroundings and possible danger.

""The people in my line of work are going to have to get a lot better at it, because they're going to need it more in the future,"" McLelland said, adding that he carries a gun everywhere he goes.

Clements came to Colorado in 2011 after working three decades in the Missouri prison system. He began a review of Colorado's solitary confinement system and closed a new prison built specifically to hold prisoners being held in solitary — Colorado State Penitentiary II.

He lived in a wooded neighborhood of large, two-story houses on 2-acre lots dotted with evergreen trees in an area known as the Black Forest. Long driveways connect the homes to narrow, winding roads that thread the hills. After word of the shooting spread Tuesday night, some residents slept with shotguns at the ready, fearful the shooter would return.

It would have been simple to find Clements' house. It took two clicks to get his street address through a publicly available Internet locator service Wednesday morning. The listing also included his previous address in Missouri.

McGovern said he tells his prosecutors to assume that any possible assailants can find their home addresses online and to check for areas they may be especially vulnerable such as neighboring alleys and poorly lit porches.

There is no central database of attacks on legal officials and senior law enforcement executives like Clements.

McGovern has documented 133 of them in the U.S. since 1950 by searching news accounts and court cases. The total includes 41 killings of judges, prosecutors and other justice and police officials. The assaults usually come with little warning, he said.

Steven K. Swensen, a former U.S. Marshal who runs a business consulting on security for court officials, said attacks on legal staff used to occur in courtrooms. As security has been expanded to protect those rooms, then courthouses, the attacks have spilled out further and further.

""Now we're having more violence off-site, in judges' houses, on their way to and from work,"" Swensen said.

Clements' survivors include two daughters and his wife, who is director of the state Office of Behavioral Health.

While Clements generally kept a low profile, his killing comes a week after he denied a request by a Saudi national to serve out the remainder of a Colorado prison sentence in Saudi Arabia.

Clements also recently requested chemicals to execute Nathan Dunlap, who was convicted of killing four people in a 1993 shooting rampage at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant and is scheduled to become the second person executed in Colorado since the death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976.

Clements' father-in-law, Carroll Smith, told The Denver Post (http://bit.ly/YX6lLN) that Clements opposed the death penalty.

Earlier this week, Clements spoke to legislators about the need for more security staff in the department's food service areas, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Alison Morgan said. Last year, a kitchen worker at a state prison was killed and another was injured in an assault involving an inmate.

Clements is at least the second state prisons chief killed in office. Michael Francke, director of the Oregon corrections department, was stabbed to death outside his office in 1989 in what prosecutors described as a bungled car burglary. A former Oregon prison inmate was found guilty of aggravated murder in 1991 and sentenced to life in prison.

Hickenlooper ordered flags lowered to half-staff at public buildings until the day after Clements' funeral.

The president delivered extensive remarks during a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room. He suggested race may have played a strong role in the case, saying that if a ""white male teen"" were involved, ""both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.""

He went far beyond his remarks a year ago in which he stirred controversy by saying if he had a son, he'd look like Martin.

""Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,"" Obama said.

The president used the highly personal comments to, in his words, put the angst in the black community in ""context."" And he also appeared to give his support to Attorney General Eric Holder's call earlier in the week for a review of ""stand-your-ground"" laws.

The laws allow people to use lethal force if they feel threatened -- even if they might have the option of retreating.

""If we're sending a message as a society ... that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see?"" Obama said.

The president acknowledged that the law was not part of the Zimmerman defense, but suggested the laws might still ""encourage"" violence. In a provocative statement, the president also questioned whether Martin, if he had a gun, could have been ""justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman because he felt threatened.""

The NRA has defended the stand-your-ground laws, saying they are vital to self-defense.

George Zimmerman's defense team put out a statement late Friday saying they ""acknowledge and understand"" the racial context of the case, and that it took ""courage"" for the president to say what he said.

But they also said ""those who look at the facts of the case without prejudice will see that it is a clear case of self-defense, and we are certain that those who take a closer look at the kind of person George Zimmerman is -- something we understand the Department of Justice is currently doing -- we are confident they will find a young man with ... a diverse ethnic and racial background who is not a racist, a man who is, in fact, sensitive to the complex racial history of our country.""

George Zimmerman's brother Robert Zimmerman responded to Obama's comments in an interview with Fox News, saying a lot of people wanted to hear from the president and ""I'm glad he spoke out today.""

He said he agrees that there should be ""teachable moments."" At the same time, he voiced concern that leaders may be responding to ""pressure"" as the Justice Department probes his brother to see if federal civil rights charges should be brought.

Obama appeared to manage expectations on that front during his remarks on Friday. He said he understands that protests may have to ""work (their) way through,"" but said these cases are traditionally handled by state and local authorities.

He said Holder is reviewing, but that people should have ""clear expectations.""

Obama reiterated that the jury -- at the state level -- has spoken.

He also offered personal details that harkened back to the speech he gave on race as a candidate in 2008. Obama said: ""It's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences, and a history that doesn't go away.""

Obama said there are ""very few"" black men who haven't been followed while shopping at a department store -- ""that includes me.""

""I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,"" Obama said.

The comments from the president -- particularly comments this extensive -- were not expected. It's unclear whether they will serve to fuel the debate or potentially ease tensions.

The Justice Department, it seems, is not dropping the issue any time soon.

Shortly before Obama spoke, members of the Congressional Black Caucus huddled in the Capitol with Justice Department officials, urging them to produce a study on the Martin case and make recommendations to avoid similar situations.

Fox News has learned that one of the CBC members, Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., has Travyon Martin's brother -- Jahvaris Fulton -- interning in her Miami office. He was a witness at the trial."

Ever since the massacres in Newtown%2C Conn.%2C this idea has been repeated like some surreal requiem.

Both its underlying assumptions are contradicted by data.

True security in our schools and other designated gun-free places might require more.

Editor's note: This column originally appeared in March.

Ever since the massacres in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., this idea has been repeated like some surreal requiem: The reason that mass gun violence keeps happening is because the United States is full of places that ban guns.

Second Amendment activists have long floated this theme, and now lawmakersacross the nation are using it, too. During a recent floor debate in the Colorado legislature, Republican state Rep. Carole Murray put it this way: ""Most of the mass killings that we talk about have been affected in gun-free zones. So when you have a gun-free zone, it's like saying, 'Come and get me.'""

The argument claims to explain both the motive behind mass shootings and how they play out. The killers deliberately choose sites where firearms are forbidden, gun-rights advocates say, and because there are no weapons, no ""good guy with a gun"" will be on hand to stop the crime.

Sound bite sophistry

With its overtones of fear and heroism, the argument makes for slick sound bites. But here's the problem: Both its underlying assumptions are contradicted by data. Not only is there zero evidence to support them, our examination at Mother Jones of America's mass shootings indicates they are just plain wrong.

Among the 62 mass shootings over the past 30 years that we studied, not a single case includes evidence that the killer chose to target a place because it banned guns. To the contrary, in many of the cases there was clearly another motive for the choice of location. For example, 20 were workplace shootings, most of which involved perpetrators who felt wronged by employers and colleagues. Last September, when a troubled man working at a sign manufacturer in Minneapolis was told he would be let go, he pulled out a 9mm Glock and killed six people and injured another before putting a bullet in his own head. Similar tragedies unfolded at a beer distributor in Connecticut in 2010 and at a plastics factory in Kentucky in 2008.

Or consider the 12 school shootings we documented, in which all but one of the killers had personal ties to the school they struck.

Or take the man who opened fire in suburban Milwaukee last August: Are we to believe that a white supremacist targeted the Sikh temple there not because it was filled with members of a religious minority he despised, but because it was a place that didn't allow firearms?

Suicide factor

Proponents of this argument also ignore that the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides. Thirty-six of the killers we studied took their own lives at or near the crime scene, while seven others died in police shootouts they had no hope of surviving (aka ""suicide by cop""). These were not people whose priority was identifying the safest place to attack.

No less a fantasy is the idea that gun-free zones prevent armed civilians from saving the day. Not one of the 62 mass shootings we documented was stopped this way.

Shooting wrong person

Veteran FBI, ATF and police officials say that an armed citizen opening fire against an attacker in a panic-stricken movie theater or shopping mall is very likely to make matters worse. Law enforcement agents train rigorously for stopping active shooters, they say, a task that requires extraordinary skills honed under acute duress.

In cases in Washington state and Texas in 2005, would-be heroes who tried to take action with licensed firearms were gravely wounded or killed. In the mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011, an armed citizen admitted to coming within a split second of gunning down the wrong person — one of the bystanders who had helped tackle and subdue the actual killer.

True security in our schools and other designated gun-free places might require more. Forbidding firearms alone clearly won't keep violence away — not least because of how easily bad guys can get their hands on guns. Nearly 80% of the mass shooters we documented obtained their weapons legally.

Indeed, America is anything but gun-free. We have more than 300 million firearms in private hands. In the past four years, nearly 100 state laws have loosened restrictions on them. To varying degrees, every state except Illinois now allows guns to be carried in public.

All of which raises an obvious question: If more guns in more places is a solution to the bloodshed, then why did we just witness the worst year for mass shootings in recent history?

A little more than a week after performing with the King College Prep band in Washington during President Barack Obama's inauguration festivities, Hadiya was fatally shot Tuesday afternoon in a park about a mile north of Obama's Kenwood home. Two other teens were wounded.

At a White House press briefing Wednesday, Obama spokesman Jay Carney was asked about Hadiya's death. ""It's a terrible tragedy any time a young person is struck down with so much of their life ahead of them, and we see it far too often,"" he said.

Hadiya's slaying also came up in an interview Obama did with Telemundo. The president was asked whether the example of Chicago, with strict gun control laws, gave credence to the National Rifle Association's position that more gun laws don't necessary mean less gun violence.

""Well, the problem is that a huge proportion of those guns come in from outside Chicago,"" Obama said. The president said it was true that creating a ""bunch of pockets of gun laws"" without a unified, integrated system of background checks makes it harder for a single community to protect itself from gun violence.

Police announced an $11,000 reward for information leading to the killer's capture and conviction during a Wednesday afternoon news conference at the North Kenwood park where Hadiya was shot.

""I want this closed now,"" said police Supt. Garry McCarthy, who was among the police chiefs in Washington on Monday to meet with Obama on gun control. ""I don't want to wait.""

Hadiya was the 42nd homicide victim this year in Chicago, where killings last year climbed above 500. Mayor Rahm Emanuel spoke with Hadiya's mother Wednesday morning and later, at an unrelated news conference, said the teenager represented ""what is best in our city.""

""A child going to school, who takes a final exam, who had just been to inaugural,"" said Emanuel, looking down at the podium for several seconds to collect himself before continuing. ""And I think if anybody has any information, you are not a snitch, you're a citizen. You're a good citizen in good standing if you help.""

Hadiya's father, Nathaniel Pendleton, pleaded for someone to step forward and bring the 15-year-old's killer to justice.

""She was destined for great things,"" he said.

Hadiya was a majorette with the band at King, one of the city's elite selective-enrollment schools. She dreamed of going to Northwestern University and talked about becoming a pharmacist or a journalist, maybe a lawyer.

She had just finished her final exams at King, where she was a sophomore, and was hanging out with friends from the school's volleyball team Tuesday afternoon in a park in the 4400 block of South Oakenwald Avenue. The group sought shelter from a rainstorm under a canopy at the park about 2:20 p.m. when a gunman jumped a fence, ran toward them and opened fire, police said.

As the teens scattered, Hadiya and two teenage boys were shot. Hadiya was hit in the back and pronounced dead at Comer Children's Hospital less than an hour after the shooting. The wounds suffered by the boys were not life-threatening.

McCarthy stressed that neither Hadiya nor anyone in the group she was with were involved with gangs. But it appears the gunman mistook the students for members of a rival gang, he said.

""This guy, whoever he was, the gunman … you took the light of my life,"" Hadiya's father said. ""Just look at yourself and just know that you took a bright person, an innocent person, a non-violent person.""

No bullet casings were found by investigators at the crime scene, leading them to believe that Hadiya may have been shot with a revolver, according to McCarthy. While it took a while to gather witnesses, McCarthy said police were making ""a lot of progress.""

At King on Wednesday, classmates created a memorial at Hadiya's locker with pictures, teddy bears and balloons, said Jayla Rufus, 16, a junior who also traveled to D.C. with the King band. ""A lot of people are saying, 'Why Hadiya? Why did it have to be her?'"" Rufus said.

During the band's three-day trip to Washington, the students visited the Washington Monument and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, Rufus said. Hadiya and the majorettes performed with the band in the Presidential Inauguration Heritage Festival.

The school won multiple awards while at the competition, including a first place honor for the band's auxiliary team that included the majorettes, according to Benjamin Washington, the school's director of bands.

Washington said Hadiya was a dedicated and enthusiastic member of the squad. She competed with nearly 100 students during her freshman year to land one of 12 spots.

""She was one of our bright, shining stars,"" Washington said. ""She had a very outgoing personality, always eager to perform.""

King's principal, Shontae Higginbottom, said Hadiya was ""a wonderful student.""

""She was well-loved by her friends, well-adored by her teachers,"" Higginbottom said. ""We are going to miss her. Our hearts are so heavy.""

Relatives of the girl said she was in an anti-gang violence video while she was attending the Carter G. Woodson Elementary School.

""So many children are out there in gangs and it is your job as students to say no to gangs and yes to a great future,"" Hadiya says in the 54-second clip."

Story highlights Saturday is one-year anniversary of mass shooting at Newtown, Connecticut, school CNN and most other news organizations say they won't report from town on Saturday Newtown officials had urged media to respect families, not descend on the small town

(CNN) —

The nation’s news media are sure to cover the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School extensively on Saturday.

But for the most part, these news organizations say they will acquiesce to the requests of local community members and not report from Newtown, Connecticut, the town where Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished school on December 14, 2012. The massacre was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.

CNN said in a statement that while it “plans to cover the one-year anniversary across our networks and platforms, we are respecting the wishes of the families, and we are not reporting from Newtown on Saturday.”

Similarly, an NBC spokeswoman said in an e-mail that “NBC News is respecting the town’s wishes and our broadcasts have no plans to be in Newtown for the anniversary.” Other television networks issued almost identical statements when contacted.

Such decisions are exceptionally rare for news organizations and underline the tension between the necessity of covering tragedy and respecting the people who are being covered – in this case, parents with dead children and their neighbors.

What really makes schools safer?

In the run-up to the anniversary, Newtown officials said they hoped the press would not descend on the small town, stirring debate about what reporters should and should not do.

“We are wishing fervently that those many persons who wish us well, and the media, will allow us this time to be alone and quiet with time for personal and communal reflection,” said Pat Llodra, the town’s first selectman, a role similar to that of mayor.

But the job of journalists is, at times, to document such reflection and share it with the public. The Associated Press said it will provide “respectful coverage” of the anniversary Saturday, “as we have since Day One of Newtown’s tragedy.”

“As a news cooperative, owned by some 1,400 daily newspapers across the country, and as a provider of news and information to hundreds of other customers worldwide, AP also recognizes its obligation to report on how Newtown is coming together to mourn and heal,” a spokesman for the news organization said.

Many news organizations visited Newtown ahead of the anniversary to conduct reporting to televise and publish on Saturday. CBS News was among those, and the network signaled this week it would not have a camera crew in the town Saturday.

“We are sensitive to the families’ concerns and will cover the anniversary in the least intrusive way possible,” said Tim Gaughan, director of special events for CBS News.

Newtown residents plead for privacy

Newspaper and online journalists are generally able to maintain low profiles on sensitive assignments, with notebooks and cell phones the only necessary tools of the trade. Television journalists, on the other hand, are more often accompanied by intrusive cameras, microphones and trucks.

Like the national networks, local television stations in Connecticut have said they will avoid using Newtown as a backdrop for live shots.

Kelly McBride, an editor of the book “The New Ethics of Journalism: Principles for the 21st Century,” wrote in a Poynter Institute blog post Friday that it “would be wrong to leave the anniversary itself unnoticed,” but that such coverage can and should be done with sensitivity.

“We live in a media world of excess. With self-discipline, restraint and a sense of service to our audience – rather than to our ratings or web metrics – journalists should be able to provide meaningful stories a year after Newtown,” McBride wrote. “And possibly such efforts can set the tone for future tragedies.”

Six of those kids were killed.

Stories of note would have to include that of the 19-year-old man who killed his 13-year-old step-sister on her birthday, while handling an AK-47 in which he ""forgot he had a loaded magazine."" And the 16-year-old shot by his 15-year-old friend while ""playing a zombie game."" And the 4-year-old who killed his father, having found an unsecured gun in the friend's home the two were visiting. This one highlights the need for more universal gun safety precautions. Most parents probably wouldn't think about how any guns are stored in homes they're visiting, nor risk insulting their hosts by asking.

In a similar vein, the owner of the gun involved in the fatal shooting of a 10-year-old boy in San Diego this week insisted that it had been stored unloaded and separately from the ammunition, both of which had been hidden from his children. But hiding guns isn't the same thing as securing them. If you're depending on just not being inquisitive enough to find them, you might be kidding yourself. And if you're depending on them being disciplined enough not to touch them if they find them, how much do you know about the kids they play with, and how much faith have you got in them?

One story not so easily categorized as classic #GunFAIL, but of interest nonetheless is that of the stolen gun sales ring broken up by police at Martin County, Florida's ... Community Christian School. Of particular note here: ""Investigators went to the school and following several interviews, determined that one student had burglarized a home on six different occasions and stole five weapons from a safe.""

Here's some interesting follow-up from previous #GunFAIL episodes that show an interesting contrast. During the past week it was announced that suspects in two accidental child shooting cases, both from Oregon, would face no charges. The first involved a 4-year-old who found a gun and shot himself, and the second, an adult male who accidentally shot his girlfriend's 9-year-old daughter while practicing quick draws with a loaded pistol. By way of contrast, there was a third case resolved this week, involving a Minnesota father whose 4-year-old found his gun and killed his 2-year-old brother. No charges in the first two cases, but a guilty verdict and the possibility of 10 years in prison in the third.

Finally, one other story worth noting: the 69-year-old member of the St. Charles Sportsman's Club in Blackberry, IL, who accidentally discharged his shotgun inside the clubhouse, injuring 10 fellow club members. That's gonna be a tough one to explain come membership renewal time.

And now, below the fold, this week's compilation."

Rucker Also Is Co-Author Of', 'A Very Stable Genius', 'A No. New York Times Bestseller']",Michelle Obama on gun control: ‘These reforms deserve a vote’,"First lady Michelle Obama, with tears in her eyes and her voice cracking, spoke out for the first time here Wednesday about the gun violence afflicting young people in cities across the nation.

She took a rare step for any first lady into the legislative fight of the hour, saying her husband, President Obama, is “fighting as hard as he can, and engaging as many people as he can, to pass common-sense reforms to protect our children from gun violence.”

“These reforms deserve a vote in Congress,” she said, drawing loud applause from hundreds of Chicago’s business executives and civic leaders who were gathered at a luncheon to raise money for a new anti-violence initiative.

Obama spoke emotionally about attending the funeral in February of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old majorette who was shot in a city park not far from the Obamas’ Chicago house and just days after visiting Washington for President Obama’s inauguration ceremonies.

“As I visited with the Pendleton family at Hadiya’s funeral, I couldn’t get over how familiar they felt to me, because what I realized was Hadiya’s family was just like my family,” the first lady said. “Hadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her. But I got to grow up and go to Princeton and Harvard Law School and have a career and a family, and the most blessed life I could ever imagine. And Hadiya — well, we know that story.”

The first lady described how Pendleton was an honors student and had two devoted parents who were “hardworking people” and “churchgoing folks.” She said the Pendletons enrolled Hadiya in cheerleading and dance classes, as well as the majorette troop, to keep her active and out of harm’s way.

Obama drew parallels to her own childhood in the 1970s on the South Side of Chicago, where, she said, she had just a few more advantages than her peers — including opportunities and adult mentors who pushed her to succeed.

“In the end, that was the difference between growing up and becoming a lawyer, a mother and first lady of the United States and being shot dead at the age of 15,” Obama said.

The first lady described a tale of two Chicagos, lamenting that many children who live in the impoverished South Side have never visited the Art Institute, walked around Millennium Park, strolled Navy Pier or seen Lake Michigan.

“Many of them don’t even know that the University of Chicago exists, let alone dream of attending that university, or any university for that matter,” she said. “Instead of spending their days enjoying the abundance of riches this city has to offer, they are consumed with watching their backs. They are afraid to walk alone because they might be jumped. They are afraid to walk in groups because that might identify them as part of a gang.”

After her speech, Obama visited with students and counselors at Harper High School, one of Chicago’s most dangerous schools. Last year, 29 current or recent Harper students were shot, eight of them fatally.

“I grew up in South Shore,” Obama told the students. “My parents were working-class folks. There isn’t much distance between me and you. . . . In this world today, if you stay focused, you can make it happen. The best thing you can do in life is really be serious about education.”

In the days following Pendleton’s funeral, Michelle Obama decided she wanted to step outside her narrow focus on military families and childhood nutrition to confront the reality of gun violence, aides said.

She decided that Wednesday’s luncheon for a new $50 million public-private initiative to combat youth violence in Chicago would be the right setting to speak out. The event brought together a diverse cross section of the city’s most powerful residents — chief executives and pastors and financiers, Democrats as well as Republicans.

Obama was introduced by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), former White House chief of staff in the Obama administration, who is spearheading the fundraising effort. So far, they have raised $33 million, officials said.

Michelle Obama pitched the audience on investing in the program, saying she hopes other cities can replicate it. “This is going to take a serious and sustained investment over a very long period of time, people,” she said. “This is forever.”

The first lady’s aides described her new focus as part of a broader agenda on youth opportunity and empowerment. With her remarks coming amid a contentious debate on Capitol Hill over stricter gun laws, however, Michelle Obama risks being seen as leveraging her widespread popularity and nonpartisan appeal to advance her husband’s legislative agenda.

In advance of Wednesday’s speech, aides said, Obama did not plan to specifically mention gun-control legislation or call on Congress to do anything. In the end, however, the first lady decided to engage fully in the political debate.

After calling on Congress to vote on gun bills, she echoed the president, saying, “We can’t stop all of the violence in the world, but if there is even one thing we can do, even one step we can take to save another child or another parent from the grief that’s visited families like Hadiya’s, and so many others here today, then don’t we have an obligation to try?”

(CNN) —

There are days when Congress seems determined to earn its 12% approval rating – and that 14 Republican senators are threatening to filibuster any new gun legislation should make your blood boil if you still have a heart to pump it with.

Four months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School slaughter, the vast majority of Americans still support some sensible new gun laws, but the same legislation has been declared DOA by conservative senators.

It’s enough for some activists to crow that the NRA’s strategy to stall until public attention moved elsewhere has succeeded. The old argument after a mass shooting – “it’s too soon” – has been revealed to be the delay and dodge it always was.

Newsweek John Avlon

In a democracy, the will of the people is supposed to have some sway.

And an astounding 91% of Americans back universal background checks – including 88% of Republicans, according to a Quinnipiac poll. Reality check: 90% of Americans don’t agree on the awesomeness of apple pie and vanilla ice cream. The disconnect between Congress and Main Street America has rarely been so stark.

This should be a no-brainer – especially because the most “controversial” initial proposals have been dropped because they were considered too politically difficult to pass. Those included a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban, which is only supported by a narrow majority of the American people, and a limit on high-capacity magazines

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was hotly criticized by liberals for backing off this proposal, but he cited pragmatism – the need to get 60 votes for passage.

That Reid himself has enjoyed high ratings from the NRA and is looking out for the political fortunes of red state Democrats running for re-election was a source of some suspicion. But even Reid’s attempt to put forward a less polarizing bill has been met by the threatened Republican filibuster. There seems to be no reward for being reasonable.

When Rand Paul filibustered the nomination of CIA Director John Brennan, I cheered – not because I agreed, but because it was a principled attempt to educate the American people on drone strike policy and because Paul pursued the filibuster the traditional “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” way, taking the Senate floor rather than blocking debate with a parliamentary maneuver. But this threatened filibuster on guns follows the old obscure obstructionist ways, blocking debate and accountability rather than encouraging it.

The arguments would-be filibusterers such as Sens. Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Mitch McConnell and Mike Enzi are making sound as if they are principled – if you don’t pay attention to the facts.

Here’s Enzi’s take: “The measures proposed currently by the majority do not reduce crime, they simply restrict the American public’s constitutional right to self-defense. … These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and proponents won’t stop with these restrictions.”

Enzi is singing from the current conservative hymnal, but let’s take a closer look.

His statement is a combination of fictitious fear-mongering (“These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights”) and the dystopian slippery slope (“and proponents won’t stop with these restrictions.”)

Let’s start with a reality check on the most predictable of the oppositional bumper stickers: the “assault on Second Amendment.”

First, the Second Amendment is already enshrined in the Constitution. It cannot be abridged by legislation.

Moreover, there exists the right to reasonable restrictions, such as the ban on machine guns that has existed in the USA since the 1930s and originally passed with NRA support. But don’t take my word for it – listen to conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote in the landmark Heller Decision, which declared D.C.’s functional ban on handguns unconstitutional:

“Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues.

“The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [United States v.] Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those ‘in common use at the time’ finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.”

Got that? Unless gun advocates are going to start calling Scalia a RINO (Republican In Name Only), there should be some room here for reasonable debate.

Yes, we need to acknowledge that Americans use guns differently in urban and rural areas. That’s one reason liberal former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean had an A rating from the NRA when he ran for president in 2004. But if politically difficult but clearly constitutional measures such as an assault weapons ban, which Ronald Reagan backed, aren’t included in the proposed legislation, we surely should be able to debate this issue rationally and in the open.

Republicans are doubling down on irrational appeals and trying to block debate.

That’s another reason this position is infuriatingly stupid – it compounds the number one negative perception about the Republican Party. Namely, that it is “inflexible and unwilling to compromise.”

Why be afraid of an open debate and an up or down vote on this issue?

Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani and John McCain have pointed out the counterproductive nature of this threatened filibuster, with McCain saying on CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand.” He added, sensibly: “What are we afraid of?”

That’s a good question. And the answer is hiding in plain sight.

Republican senators are afraid of a conservative primary challenge fueled by huge amounts of outside money backed by activists and lobbying groups such as the NRA.

I genuinely believe that both parties have good ideas and good people – and principled voices are arguing for a constructive compromise and a real debate on this issue.

Opponents can’t even defend their inaction by arguing they are representing their constituents because of the overwhelming bipartisan margins for the proposed increased background checks and cracking down on gun-trafficking. But hyperpartisan politics are once again threatening to trump policy-driven problem solving. That’s why Congress has such a dismal approval rating in the first place.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, parents who lost children in the Newtown massacre will be walking the halls of Congress, trying to appeal to the conscience of our legislators. It will be interesting to see whether their personal appeals will carry as much weight as the influence of gun lobbyists.

This issue isn’t academic – it is an urgent test of our elected representatives’ ability to be responsive to the public will and reason together.

If Newtown can’t get Washington’s attention, what will? The shooting of a colleague, Gabby Giffords, apparently didn’t. Conscience and compassion should matter more than cold hard cash.

States struggling to make ends meet during the recent recession cut more than $4 billion from their mental-health budgets from 2009 through 2012.

Now with the one-year anniversary of the Dec. 14, 2012, Sandy Hook elementary school shootings just days away, a new report shows at least 37 states have increased spending on mental health programs.

Texas lawmakers appear to have approved the biggest increase -- $259 million more in their newest two-year budget, the largest such increase in state history, according the National Alliance on Mental Health.

“With few exceptions, state legislatures acknowledged the need [to] increase or maintain mental-health appropriations or enact legislation,” the group said in its 2013 State Legislation Report.

Many of the increases are related to efforts to comply with mental-health provisions in ObamaCare that start next year. And much of the legislation enacted this year was to expand the state-federal Medicaid program under the law because it is essential in paying and providing coverage for the estimated 2.7 million uninsured Americans affected by mental illness, the report states.

Oregon, for example, increased its 2014-15 budget by roughly 22 percent to comply with the president’s signature health care law.

The group argues that timing also played a factor in the increases, particularly the White House’s response to the Sandy Hook shootings -- in which 20 students and six adults were fatally shot. And that the mass shooting happened right before state legislative sessions started.

The White House called for widespread changes including tighter school security and increased background checks on gun buyers. However, the NAMI argued the vast majority of people with mental illness is “no more violent than the general population” and called for providers of mental-health care to do a better job of complying with exist standards when reporting dangerous behavior related to gun ownership.

The report points out that mental-health advocates warned that the “avalanche” of state legislation could result in Americans not seeking mental-health care and that changes could threaten civil liberties.

Among the changes cited was the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, one of the first bills enacted in 2013 that increased the responsibilities of providers to turn over mental health records as related to gun sales. Similar SAFE acts were enacted in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut and Tennessee.

The report also points out Alaska and North Carolina reduced their mental health budgets.

The Obama administration last month announced the final executive order of 23 that the president signed in January, while Congress has not come through in efforts to keep guns out the hands of people who are mentally ill and dangerous.

One change is mental health patients can now get immediate emergency room care, like somebody with a broken bone, without having to get pre-approval from their insurance company.

""Imagine what it would mean if people felt as comfortable saying they were going for counseling as they do saying they're going for a flu shot or physical therapy,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in announcing the change.

Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said before the president signed the executive orders that he didn’t know whether an assault weapons ban could pass the Senate but thought a bill to improved background checks and related ones could pass.

""There are some who say nothing will pass,” he said. “I disagree with that. What I'm interested in is what we can get."""

The summary report, issued by Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice and lead investigator, State Attorney Stephen Sedensky III, states that Lanza shot and killed the principal and school psychologist as they responded to calls of a man with a gun in the school.

""The shooter then went into the main office, apparently did not see the staff who were hiding there, and returned to the hallway,"" the report states.

The report continues:

""After leaving the main office, the shooter then went down the same hallway in which he had just killed two people and entered first grade classrooms 8 and 10, the order in which is unknown. While in those rooms he killed the two adults in each room, fifteen children in classroom 8 and five in classroom 10. All of the killings were done with the Bushmaster rifle. He then took his own life with a single shot from a Glock 20, 10 mm pistol in classroom 10.""

The report does not establish a conclusive motive for the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting that left 20 children, six school staff members and the gunman dead. It does, however, highlight Lanza's ""preoccupation with mass shootings, in particular the Columbine shootings, and a strong interest in firearms.""

Items found within digital evidence seized from Lanza's possessions include:

Bookmarks pertaining to firearms, military, politics, mass murder, video games, music, books, Army Ranger, computers and programs, ammunition, candy, economic books

Two videos showing suicide by gunshot

Commercial movies depicting mass shootings

The computer game titled “School Shooting” where the player controls a character who enters a school and shoots at students

Images of the shooter holding a handgun to his head

Images of the shooter holding a rifle to his head

Five-second video (dramatization) depicting children being shot

A spreadsheet listing mass murders by name and information about the incident

Materials regarding the topic of pedophilia and advocating for rights for pedophiles (not child pornography)

Large amount of materials relating to Columbine shootings and documents on mass murders

The report also states that authorities recovered a New York Times article from February 18, 2008, regarding the school shooting at Northern Illinois University and photocopied newspaper articles from 1891 pertaining to the shooting of school children.

Authorities found Lanza ""dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,"" according to the report. He was wearing nearly all black and had a yellow earplug in each ear.

Monday's release is only a partial collection of evidence contained in a several thousand-page file belonging to the Connecticut State Police, according to the Associated Press. Sendensky wouldn't say why the full evidence file is being withheld from the public. Previously, police have cited consideration for victims' families and the sheer size of the investigation as reasons for keeping the file private.

Critics say that withholding information demonstrates the secrecy of the state's investigation.

""What I found troubling about the approach of the state's attorney is that from my perspective, [Sedensky] seems to have forgotten his job is to represent the state of Connecticut,"" Dan Klau, a Hartford attroney, told the AP. ""His conduct in many instances has seemed more akin to an attorney in private practice representing Sandy Hook families.""

Terrie Ann Campbell, 38, who works for the school district in Orlando, looked on from a lawn chair on the courthouse lawn where she had propped up her “Justice 4 Trayvon” sign in the damp grass on what had already become a hot and humid day.

About 50 people gathered in the morning to protest as jurors deliberated the fate of Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer who identifies himself as Latino and who is charged with second-degree murder in connection with the Feb. 26, 2012, fatal shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin.

Zimmerman maintains he shot Martin in self-defense after Martin suddenly attacked him in a confrontation on that rainy night in Sanford.

“It was peaceful in the beginning, but it seems like there are certain people out here trying to provoke a reaction,” said Campbell, who is black and was hoping for a guilty verdict in the Zimmerman trial that has transfixed the nation.

As the six-woman jury continued their second day of deliberations Saturday, local authorities staffed the emergency operations center and sheriff’s deputies lingered at the edge of the courthouse lawn, where metal barricades had been erected.

“Shouting at each other -- it’s not going to do anything,” Campbell said.

As the white-haired man made his way through the crowd, a chorus of angry voices trailed him.

“Zimmerman’s a killer!”

“He’s a murderer!”

“You’re a racist!”

Eventually, half a dozen protesters surrounded the man with signs, chanting. One of the young women wore a T-shirt that said, “What if it were your son?” They talked about the O.J. Simpson case, one holding a sign that said, “The glove don’t fit.”

GRAPHIC: Who’s who in the Trayvon Martin case

They tried to convince the white-haired man that he was wrong, but the man just shook his head.

“He has a right to self-defense,” he said of Zimmerman.

Tempers flared. Voices rose. But no one came to blows.

In the end, the old man walked away to talk to more Martin supporters, including a young black man wearing a T-shirt with Zimmerman’s face in the cross-hairs.

Across the barricade, a few Zimmerman supporters held signs that said “Not guilty” and “Free George.” They did not tangle much with the other group.

The white-haired man, Casey Kole, who is white, wanted to talk to the other side.

Kole, 66, a retired oil executive and chauffeur from Orlando, described himself as “the silent majority type.” A conservative and a Navy veteran, he insisted he’s not racist. Like many across the country, he watched the trial on television. Watching, he came to believe Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was in the right when he shot the unarmed teen.

“He’s a man who’s patrolling an area without being paid, an area that had had a number of burglaries,” Kole said. “I don’t think the prosecution offered any evidence that he’s guilty.”

Kole said he’s not worried about clashes in the streets after the jury issues its verdict, nothing like the 1992 Los Angeles riots, he said.

“I would expect law enforcement would make sure there is peace,” he said. “That’s why it’s remarkable that you see me on this side, the opposition side, and there’s no confrontation. We can disagree. We can do it in a courteous manner. That’s the great benefit of this country -- we don’t resort to mob violence.”

Cynthia Bradford, of Syracuse, N.Y., was among the crowd and said her nephew, 13-year-old Jerell Montgomery, was killed 19 years ago at Syracuse University. “It’s not about black or white, she said. “This type of killings has to stop.”

Nearby, Army veteran Tatiandra Taylor, of Orlando, Fla., was calling for free speech. “They want us to take down our signs,” she said. “They should do it themselves.”

Laurie Isom, 38, a stay-at-home mom, brought her two children to the protest, ages 9 and 3. They all held signs and chanted. Last year, they marched through downtown Sanford to demand that Zimmerman be charged, as he eventually was -- not by local police, but by a special prosecutor appointed by the governor.

Isom, who is white, grew up in Sanford, and said the case has not divided the town along racial lines. But she wished it had united the town more.

“Our town is pretty shaken, but I believe justice will be served,” she said as television camera operators recorded the crowd and news helicopters buzzed overhead. “Regardless of how the verdict will go, people will be peaceful. They’re saying it’s going to be an L.A. riot but I don’t believe that. If I did, I wouldn’t have my kids out here.”

The report includes material gathered by state and local police, as well as by federal investigators, who tried to glean information from the computer hard drive of gunman Adam Lanza.

Lanza damaged the computer before shooting his way into the Newtown school shortly after classes had begun. Armed with three weapons that had belonged to his mother, Nancy Lanza, the gunman killed 20 first-graders and six adults in the school before shooting himself to death. Earlier that morning, he had shot to death Nancy Lanza.

WHO THEY WERE: Newtown shooting victims

“The investigation of this incident is unparalleled in the one hundred and ten year history of the Connecticut State Police,” said Reuben F. Bradford, commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, in a letter accompanying the massive trove of files.

“I hope that the release of this report, though painful, will allow those who have been affected by it to continue in their personal process of healing and will provide helpful information that can be put to use to prevent such tragedies in the future,” Bradford said.

Some of the documents record how police, often accompanied by clergy and social workers, visited the families of those slain in the Sandy Hook shooting.

One investigative report describes how Trooper Rafael Figueiral went to a home with Father Michael Novajosky to inform relatives that Victoria Soto, a first-grade teacher, was among those killed at the school.

PHOTOS: Newtown school shooting

“Father Novajosky offered a prayer to which they gladly accepted,” the report states.

Some of the material has been redacted, but the trooper notes that the relative agreed to tell others of the visit.

In addition to photographs and videos, the files include detailed descriptions of victims’ belongings retrieved and returned to their families: jewelry, eyeglass cases, earrings and hair clips. It also included diagrams of the interior of the school, noting the location of bullet casings and magazines found strewn in the hallways and classrooms.

The report also revealed the breadth of Lanza’s gunfire, describing bullet holes found on the car of one victim that was parked in the school’s parking lot. The vehicle, a Honda with a decal on the truck that read “I (heart-shaped symbol) my cat,” had three “suspected bullet strikes” on the outside, according to one of the thousands of brief police reports summarizing the scene.

At least one other car in the lot also had damage from bullets, according to police reports. It was not clear whether the bullet holes came from Lanza’s gun or the police.

Much of the material is heavily redacted, in keeping with state laws that prohibit showing photographs of homicide victims. Names and other identifying information of most witnesses have also been redacted.

But the hours of videos included in the report are chilling nonetheless, showing the school just a few hours after Lanza’s rampage, some classrooms appearing untouched, with scenes of elementary school games and other activities clearly visible.

Advertisement

One video, though, shows what appears to be a magazine from one of Lanza’s weapons on the floor of the school hallway.

Items found inside the Lanza home included a card, dated June 10, 1999, from the Sandy Hook school, and addressed to Nancy Lanza. The card thanked her “for being such a special volunteer” at the school’s 5th grade “stepping-up ceremony.”

Pictures inside the Lanza home showed a colored photograph of a young boy holding a gun, with ammunition spread across his lap, and Nancy Lanza’s shoes lined up in neat rows beneath her bed, not far from the bullet casings found on the floor. One shows her bed, a large stain of blood on the white sheets.

Written in the kind of bureaucratic language often used by police investigators, the documents nevertheless paint a picture of families trying to cope with the painful shooting and officers, social workers and clergy trying to be helpful.

One trooper describes his visit to a family the day after the shooting to tell them that their son had been positively identified from photographs as one of those killed. The visit is described in the sparsest language, with names redacted to protect privacy.

“We remained with the [redacted] family at their residence for a period of time before returning to the command post,” the trooper writes, but gives no details of what was discussed.

The reports go on to describe the return of personal effects such as cellphones and clothing. One redacted report notes that a “backpack, lunchbox and two toys were returned” to relatives about a month after the shooting.

The release had been expected following last month’s unsealing of a summary of the findings. That summary, written by the state’s attorney for the Danbury region, Stephen Sedensky III, shed light on Lanza’s mental illness and on the troubled home he shared with his mother in an upscale area of Newtown.

Advertisement

It showed that Nancy Lanza worried about her son’s isolation and obvious mental illness but that she allowed him to dictate rules of the house, including banning her from his bedroom and not allowing her to put up a Christmas tree or have a cat in the house.

Adam Lanza kept his bedroom windows covered in black plastic and rarely went out, except to go to a local cinema and play hours of Dance Dance Revolution, in which a player on a platform moves his feet as directed by a video. As he grew more isolated, Lanza spoke to his mother only via email or text, Sedensky’s summary said.

Nancy Lanza had several legally purchased and registered guns in their home, along with ammunition. Her son used those weapons to kill Nancy Lanza as she lay in bed the morning of the Sandy Hook attack. He then drove to the elementary school, about five miles away, and opened fire.

The shootings led to calls for stricter gun-control laws at the federal level. But Washington lawmakers backed down from legislation that would have required universal background checks on all firearm purchases and limited magazine sizes.

Newtown officials have called for privacy on anniversary

In his weekly radio address%2C President Obama said the tragedy inspired nation to make communities safer

20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School one year ago

A year after the deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., bells tolled across the town at 9:30 a.m. Saturday as the small community planned a day of quiet reflection with private memorial services.

The bells rang 26 times as names of each of the victims were read at St. Rose of Lima church in Newtown, one of several houses of worship that was holding private services Saturday for a community still grieving for the 20 children and six educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

President Obama and the first lady marked the anniversary of the shooting at the White House Saturday by lighting 26 candles and bowing their heads for a moment of silence.

In his weekly address, Obama asked Americans to consider their role in preventing future violence, saying the country has not done enough to make communities safer since the tragedy. Parents of children killed in the tragedy lent their voices to efforts to prevent such violence from happening again but more action is needed to stop violence, he said.

""We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily,"" Obama said. ""We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved and valued and cared for.""

Gov. Dannel P. Malloy asked for houses of worship around the state to ring their bells at 9:30 a.m. and called for flags to be lowered to half-staff around the state.

St. Rose of Lima will host a service that will include the dedication of a memorial arch and the ringing of peace bells that also were rung at Virginia Tech after the mass shooting there in 2007 and in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Newtown officials have called for privacy and asked town residents to honor the victims through acts of service and kindness. At a joint appearance earlier this week in Newtown, some of the victims' families urged people to find ways to give back to their own communities.

""In this way, we hope that some small measure of good may be returned to the world,"" JoAnn Bacon, whose 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte, was killed at Sandy Hook.

The town had no formal events planned for Saturday, and officials have discouraged the news media from coming to Newtown.

""We are trying to respect the world's interest in us, but we also have a real need in our community to gain a foothold,"" First Selectman Pat Llodra said.

The gunman, Adam Lanza, killed his mother inside their Newtown home on Dec. 14, 2012, before driving to the school, where he carried out his rampage. He killed himself as police arrived.

Town asks residents for acts of %22service and kindness%22 to honor those killed in last year%27s attack

Some media groups%2C including USA TODAY%2C will honor request and stay away

NEWTOWN, Conn. — Local government officials are urging the news media to stay away Saturday, the first anniversary of the Dec. 14 shootings that killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

""The community is choosing to remember and honor those who lost their lives in the Sandy Hook tragedy in ways that are quiet, personal and respectful — centered on themes of kindness, love and service to others,"" Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra said in a written statement Monday.

Llodra said the town will not be hosting any memorial events and requested that the public and the press allow Newtown residents ""the time to be alone and quiet with time for personal and communal reflection.""

USA TODAY Editor-in-Chief David Callaway said the news organization will not report on the anniversary from Newtown on Saturday. ""We'll respect the wishes of the people of Newtown,"" he said.

Some other media organizations, including CNN, have announced that they also will not be in Newtown to cover the anniversary of the tragedy.

""While CNN plans to cover the one-year anniversary across our networks and platforms, we are respecting the wishes of the families, and we are not reporting from Newtown on Saturday,"" CNN spokeswoman Bridget Leininger said.

Craig Duff, professor of journalism at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, says each media outlet has to make up its own mind whether to be in Newtown Saturday to report the tragic anniversary. Journalists, he says, should ask themselves whether being in Newtown is essential to reporting their stories. ""If the answer is no, don't go there,"" Duff says.

Media outlets that decide to go to Newtown should consider the footprint they will make, he says. They should be respectful and, for example, ""not bring in three live broadcast trucks when a small crew can cover any news that may happen.""

Llodra said she is encouraging every Newtown resident to use the days leading up to the anniversary ""as a time to formally commit to acts of service and kindness to honor those who lost their lives at Sandy Hook.""

Before killing 26 people at the school, gunman Adam Lanza shot to death his mother, Nancy Lanza, at their Sandy Hook home on the morning of Dec. 14. The gunman later committed suicide at the school.

Newtown churches and other houses of worship will hold special services Saturday to reflect on and honor those who were killed.

Llodra said she and other Newtown officials met with the local print media last week and the national TV media Monday and will meet with USA TODAY and other national media Tuesday. She said the same message is being provided at each meeting: The public and the media should stay away from Newtown on Saturday.

""There is nothing new in the town's position to respectfully request the media to not come to Newtown to cover the first anniversary,"" Llodra told USA TODAY.

At a press conference Monday, 14 families of children and educators killed at Sandy Hook school said they plan to light a candle this weekend in memory of their loved ones.

In a joint statement, the families said the tragedy forever changed their lives, and they thanked the world for its outpouring of support. The families said they have established a new website, MySandyHookFamily.org, for all 26 families who lost a relative in the shootings at the school.

""In the midst of our grief, we have come to realize that we want our loved ones to be remembered for the lives they lived and how they touched our hearts,"" the website says. ""We have been uplifted by the support of so many people, and we would like to keep that spirit of unity and love alive in all we do to remember those we so dearly miss.""

The site asks the public to understand that each family is unique in its own experiences following the tragedy and has its own voice and perspective. ""By creating this website, we hope to offer an opportunity to communicate with our families and honor our loved ones, while at the same time respecting each family's individual journey and unique experiences,"" it says."

Story highlights LZ Granderson: We're hearing more knee-jerk rhetoric about gun-control measures He says there's not enough information about Navy Yard shootings to figure out solutions More gun-control measures are unrealistic and won't prevent the carnage, he says Granderson: Many different factors lead to gun violence

(CNN) —

Another day, another mass shooting in America.

More blood, more tears, more knee-jerk rhetoric about finding a solution for a bunch of different problems.

Those who knew Aaron Alexis – the shooter who killed 12 and injured eight more at the Washington Navy Yard this week – said he was a quiet, shy man.

ESPN LZ Granderson

At one point he was studying Buddhism and meditated often.

A little more digging, and we find he had several gun-related arrests and a pattern of misconduct in the Navy, but he was honorably discharged.

Pieces of a puzzle we may never fully put together.

But the fact that there is still so much we don’t know about Alexis – or the motive behind the shootings – won’t detour gun-control advocates from lumping his story in with that of Adam Lanza, the man police say is responsible for the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with the victims from gang- and drug-related shootings.

This is why after the tears have dried and the blood washes away, little, if anything, will change.

And because gun-control advocates so often try to cobble together every distinct narrative involving guns into a one-size-fits-all conversation, they are as much to blame for this merry-go-round as the gun lobbyists against whom they fight.

Gun shops are illegal in Chicago.

Opinion: What could have prevented carnage?

The city has bans on both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And yet each week people continue to die in the streets from gunshot wounds.

This conundrum is just one example why making note that more Americans have died from gun violence here at home since Newtown than in the nine years fighting a war in Iraq is the kind of factoid that grabs our attention but undermines the true goal: curtailing the violence.

Not all deaths involving guns are the same – therefore trying to address each incident from the same point of view is futile. Until we learn more about Alexis – the events leading up to the shootings and the motive – the tragedy in Washington should not be used as catalyst for a conversation about gun control.

Instead, we should mourn and wait for more information.

Far too often assumptions surrounding the details of tragedies such as the one in Washington are made, and well-intentioned stances fall apart when additional facts come to light.

The guns James Holmes was charged with using in Aurora were purchased legally. Beyond the presence of a gun, the crimes committed in the movie theater are not at all similar to what happens in the streets of our large cities. And each time a politician or gun-control advocate tries to use these two very different examples interchangeably, the entire conversation and argument are compromised.

This happened after Newtown.

It happened after Aurora.

And it will keep continue to happen until the advocates accept that ridding the country of guns is a hopeless – and unconstitutional mission – and that the real goal should be addressing the factors that lead to the various forms of gun violence: factors such as poverty, mental health and failing schools.

Last month the nation breathed a sigh of relief after Antoinette Tuff, a bookkeeper in an elementary school in suburban Atlanta, prevented a man with an AK-47-type weapon and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition from hurting anyone.

It was not the time to talk generally about gun violence in this country. It was the time to discuss specifics such as cuts to mental health and its impact on services, given that the suspect, 20-year-old Michael Brandon Hill, has a long history of mental disorders. Hill’s storyline is similar to that of Lanza, and there are questions whether Holmes, the admitted shooter in the Aurora movie theater, is insane.

Public debates with Wayne LaPierre and attacks on the National Rifle Association have proven to be an ineffective way to prevent gun violence. In the wake of the Washington Navy Yard killings, perhaps a new strategy, one that doesn’t involve playing on the nation’s emotions or challenging the relevance of the Second Amendment, should be employed. That’s not saying the NRA has won – in fact, I think LaPierre should step down because each time he opens his mouth, he steps in it – but at the end of the day the organization is more of an agitator than the enemy.

The folks spraying our cities with bullets are not NRA members or even legal gun owners. LZ Granderson

There is no one enemy.

Thus there is no one solution.

Because like it or not, the folks spraying our cities with bullets are not NRA members or legal gun owners. And despite the tendency to tie it all together, they have nothing to do with the Adam Lanzas of the world.

And it’s too early to know how Alexis fits in the conversation.

According to a count by USA Today, more than 900 people have been killed in mass shootings since 2006. The thousands of other victims of gun violence over the past seven years died from many different circumstances, requiring different conversations.

This is why gun-control advocates need to abandon the routine of using mass shootings to turn law-abiding citizens into social pariahs and instead focus on something that could work.

(CNN) —

The second Boston bombing suspect is in custody. Now everyone will focus on what it all means, what “lesson” we can learn from the events.

This is Martin Richard’s lesson:

“No more hurting people.”

JUSTIN LAROSE/cnn

Martin Richard was one of three innocent bystanders to die on Patriot’s Day. As we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and Congress, we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or Facebook walls, but on display.

The worldwide response to that picture – which his teacher, Rachel Moo, said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin – has been both heart-stirring and heartbreaking. People are striving to remember and to honor, yes; even more, though, they are trying to make his words real.

Everyone killed in the Boston bombing, and during the events that flowed from it, was under 30. Martin Richard was 8 years old; how will his classmates handle their grief?

Krystle Campbell, age 29, had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother. Doctors had told Krystle’s mother she had survived the blast, but they had mistaken Krystle’s friend for Krystle. What must her mother and grandmother feel?

Lingzi Lu was a 23-year-old graduate student, the only child of her parents in China, who said learning of her death was “a dagger in our hearts.” Sean Collier, 26, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun. He had been a campus policeman with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for only a little over a year, and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer.

Three days after the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the U.S. Senate defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers, something 90% of Americans want. As a result of the bombing, immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional Senate.

Every pundit and every politician feels every bit of bombast is justified.

And the children? Pictures and comments, memorials on Facebook. That’s all.

“No more hurting people. Peace.”

The injured: Martin’s father and older brother, Henry, escaped injury. His 6-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. Martin’s mother, Denise Richard, 43, had brain surgery for a serious injury. The father, Bill Richard, 42, returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing, and a neighbor said he was pale, almost dazed, and too grief-stricken to talk.

The sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies, flowers, and stars that Richard and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon.

Jack Hart, a former state senator, told the Boston Globe that the Richards are “pillars of the community … a model family, who somehow always found the time to give something back.”

“Any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult, but when you know people, when it’s people in your life, in your school, that’s when it really hits home,”

The Boston Globe quoted a classmate of Martin’s, Colin Baker, 9, who said about Martin: “If somebody was left out, he would come say, ‘Want to join my group?’ He sticks up for kids.”

“It should not have happened to him,” Colin said to the Globe.

“It should not have happened to nobody.”

As I read and hear these responses, I keep thinking, what are we – the adults – what are we telling the children? Do we think they don’t see the hollowness behind our hallowed words? Do we think they don’t know the difference between courage and cowardice?

There’s a cliché: “Perfect is the enemy of the good.” Apparently, legislation must be perfect, because even after this horror, we are still finding ways to divide people. Should suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev be treated as an enemy combatant? Did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received? Questions. Questions.

But let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives. Some will have to learn how to simply stand up again – wounded forever.

We should hold Martin’s sign in our hearts and resolve to do better. Because, with President Barack Obama, “I’m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words.”

I, too, believe that, “sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it.”

“No more hurting people. Peace.”

Authorities say the former Navy reservist, who had been living in Fort Worth, was the dead gunman at the Washington Navy Yard.

Authorities say the Navy veteran, who had been living in Fort Worth, was the dead gunman at the Washington Navy Yard.

Authorities say the Navy veteran, who had been living in Fort Worth, was the dead gunman at the Washington Navy Yard.

Aaron Alexis lived for a time in a bungalow in the woods near a Buddhist temple in Fort Worth, where he occasionally joined Thai immigrants in meditation. Aaron Alexis died Monday in a gun battle with police at the Washington Navy Yard after he allegedly killed at least 12 people.

Along the way, the man named as the shooter in Monday’s mass killing at Building 197 was discharged from the Navy Reserve, arrested after firing a bullet through his upstairs neighbor’s floor and then asked to leave his Fort Worth apartment.

One Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Alexis was discharged in January 2011 for “a pattern of misconduct” and that the 2010 gun incident in Texas played a role in his departure.

But Alexis, 34, had no trouble landing a civilian job. He moved from Fort Worth to Washington about a month ago, friends said, and was hired as an hourly tech employee for The Experts, a Hewlett-Packard subcontractor that is updating computer systems at Navy and Marine Corps installations worldwide. He was scheduled to begin work at the Washington Navy Yard this month.

Those who knew Alexis in recent years describe him as a “sweet and intelligent guy” (a regular customer at the Thai restaurant where he had been a waiter) and “a good boy” (his landlord), but also as “very aggressive,” someone who seemed as though he might one day kill himself (a lay worker at the Buddhist temple where Alexis worshiped).

That angry streak flared often enough to create an arrest record in three states.

In 2004, Alexis was arrested in Seattle after he fired three shots from a Glock pistol into the tires of a Honda Accord that two construction workers had parked in a driveway adjacent to Alexis’s house. Alexis’s father told detectives then that his son “had experienced anger management problems that the family believed was associated with PTSD,” or post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the police report. The father said Alexis had been “an active participant in rescue attempts of Sept. 11, 2001.”

Alexis’s explanation for his behavior that day: The construction workers had “mocked” and “disrespected” him and then he had “a black-out fueled by anger.”

He was arrested but not charged, Seattle police said. The paperwork apparently was lost.

“That report never got to the Seattle city attorney’s office,” said Kimberly Mills, a spokeswoman for the city attorney. “Consequently, we never filed charges.”

In 2008, Alexis was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge in DeKalb County, Ga. He spent two nights in jail, police said, but they had no other details.

More recently, Alexis struck those who crossed his path as a man of sharp contrasts. He was learning the Thai language, visited Thailand for a month, was studying for an online degree in aeronautical engineering, and enjoyed conversing with diners, according to friends, customers and fellow worshipers. But some said he had an aggressive streak that made them keep their distance and avoid personal questions.

“He’s a 13-year-old stuck in a 34-year-old body,” said Oui Suthamtewakul, owner of the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement, Tex., and a friend who lived with Alexis for most of the past three years. “He needs attention.”

Alexis often worked as an unpaid waiter for Suthamtewakul and his wife, Kristi, but lived with them rent-free. The couple described Alexis as a helpful, chatty guy who liked to watch cooking shows on TV.

“He always hit on girls,” Suthamtewakul said, adding that he had to scold his friend for being too forward with female customers.

Suthamtewakul said Alexis “had a gun at all times” and fired a bullet through the wall of his room in the summer of 2012. “You’re gonna kill me,” the restaurateur told his friend. Alexis apologized and said it was an accident.

Alexis drank alcohol frequently and in large quantities, Suthamtewakul said: “He can start drinking at 9:30 in the morning. He drinks often and for fun, but it was never a problem.” Asked what he will remember about his friend, Suthamtewakul said, “Him with a Heineken.”

Alexis grew up in Brooklyn with his parents, Cathleen and Anthony Alexis, said his aunt Helen Weekes. “We haven’t seen him for years,” she said.

He spent nearly four years in the Navy as a full-time reservist from May 2007 until January 2011, according to the Navy. A Navy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Alexis received a general discharge for “misconduct” and that the 2010 firearms incident in Texas played a role in his departure.

Alexis achieved his final rank — aviation electrician’s mate 3rd class — in December 2009.

He spent the bulk of his service time — 2008 to 2011 — assigned to the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 46 at Naval Air Station Fort Worth, records show. He received the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal, awards of minor distinction.

Despite the circumstances surrounding his discharge, Alexis apparently was issued a government contractor access card that would have allowed him into the Navy Yard and other military installations, said Thomas Hoshko, chief executive of The Experts. His security clearance was updated in July.

“There had to be a thorough investigation,” Hoshko said. “There is nothing that came up in all the searches.”

Alexis had finished a contract in Japan for the company at the end of 2012, Hoshko said.

“Nobody could have done anything to prevent this except Aaron Alexis,” he said. “Maybe he snapped. I don’t know.”

In Fort Worth, Alexis lived for a time in a gated townhouse community called Orion at Oak Hill. In September 2010, police were called to Apartment 2023 after Alexis’s upstairs neighbor complained that a bullet had been fired through her apartment. Police determined that Alexis had fired a round that went up through her floor and into her ceiling.

The woman told police that Alexis had complained several times that she was too loud. She said he had confronted her a few days earlier in the complex’s parking lot “about making too much noise,” according to a police report.

The woman said that “she is terrified of Aaron and feels that this was done intentionally,” the police report said.

Police tried three times to contact Alexis by knocking on his apartment door, but he didn’t respond. Only after they called in firefighters to force entry did he emerge. He told police that he had been cleaning his gun while cooking and that it accidentally discharged because his hands were greasy, according to the police report.

“He told me that he began to take the gun apart when his hands slipped and pulled the trigger, discharging a round into the ceiling,” the officer wrote. Alexis was arrested for improperly discharging a firearm, but the county district attorney’s office said Monday that there was not enough evidence to pursue the case. Alexis’s mug shot from that arrest shows a clean-shaven man with soft eyes and an impassive expression.

A couple of weeks later, the apartment complex began eviction proceedings against Alexis, according to county records.

Soon after, Somsak Srisan, a Thai immigrant in Fort Worth, met Alexis at the Wat Busayadhammavanaram Meditation Center, where Alexis had occasionally practiced meditation starting in the summer of 2010. Alexis said he needed a place to stay, and Somsak offered him a two-bedroom white bungalow a short walk away — if he promised not to smoke or drink. Alexis rented the place for $600 a month and never missed a payment, said Somsak, 57.

“He’s a good boy,” said Somsak, who spoke halting English. “Everybody would say, ‘He’s a good boy.’ ”

Alexis occasionally meditated at the temple and helped there when needed, said Somsak, who was impressed that his tenant studied the Thai language and visited Thailand.

On Monday, as word spread about the shootings, the temple filled with members eager to share recollections of Alexis. “They don’t believe it that he could kill 12 people like that,” Somsak said. “I think probably somebody tried to put him down. I don’t know. Did somebody try to discriminate against him?”

Somsak asked Alexis only once why he had left his job at the naval base. It was a brief conversation.

“I asked him, ‘Why you quit the job with the government?’ ” Somsak said. “He said, ‘Somebody doesn’t like me.’ ”

Somsak left it there, he said, because “I don’t want to go too deep with him.”

Alexis visited the center about twice a week and was known as a quiet, if tightly wound, participant, a temple staff member said.

“He would help people if they came in carrying heavy things,” said J. Sirun, an assistant to the monks. “From the outside, he was a quiet person. But on the inside, I think he was very aggressive. He did not like to be close with anybody, like a soldier who has been at war.”

Sirun said he avoided Alexis, who preferred to keep to himself. But Alexis was no loner; he had many Thai friends and spoke Thai “very well,” Sirun said. “He understood about 75 percent of the language.”

Customers saw him studying Thai at a table there during his off hours. Alexis stopped showing up at the Buddhist center early in 2011, he said. “I didn’t think he could be this violent,” he said. “I would not have been surprised to hear he had committed suicide. But I didn’t think he could commit murder.”

Relatives contacted by reporters were stunned to hear that Alexis was suspected in the shootings. “I’d be shocked if it was him, but I don’t know,” said Weekes, his aunt, her voice trailing off.

Even as he worked for the defense contractor, Alexis was pursuing a bachelor’s degree in aeronautics as an online student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The university, in Daytona Beach, Fla., said he enrolled in July 2012 via the school’s Fort Worth campus. He remained a student in good standing, said Melanie Hanns, director of university communications.

“He was enrolled for this semester,” she said.

FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave asked the public to call 1-800-CALL-FBI with any details about Alexis.

Proposal mirrors NRA plan unveiled last week

Critics say plan would endanger students%2C faculty

Supporters say plan worth risk%2C teachers can be trained

INDIANAPOLIS -- Ashley Woolf was an eighth grader at Martinsville West Middle School two years ago when pandemonium erupted.

Gunshots echoed in the hallway outside the school cafeteria doors. Two bullets had hit a 15-year-old. The shooter, another 15-year-old.

""A teacher said, 'Stay here, lock the doors,'"" Woolf recalled. ""People were freaking out and confused. I was terrified and frightened.""

Within a week, Martinsville had armed police officers in every school. More than two years later Woolf, now a high-school sophomore, says she feels much safer.

""I think they could get to someone if it happened again,"" Woolf said.

Whether that's so is at the heart of the debate over a controversial proposal offered last week in the Indiana General Assembly. If passed, the proposal would require every public or charter school in the state to have at least one designated school ""protection"" officer on campus, with a weapon, at all times.

Most notably, the proposal says if schools can't afford a police officer, it can arm a teacher, principal or other employee. Not specified is what training would be required or what would be expected of the protection officer in a crisis.

How to prevent school shootings has been part of the national conversation for more than a decade, gaining intensity after the December killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

Some say the answer is tougher gun restrictions; others favor a stronger armed presence on campuses. It is an intellectual and emotional debate taking place not only in academia, among lawmakers and policy advocates but also in living rooms and at dinner tables across the state. Even among gun-rights advocates, some question the wisdom of Indiana's proposal -- including Ashley's father, Mark, who is a National Rifle Association supporter.

""Teachers are not prepared for that kind of responsibility or adversity,"" said Woolf, 56. ""That would be a recipe for disaster.""

Paul Helmke supports putting police in schools if local districts decide that's right for them. But a statewide mandate that puts guns in the hands of teachers, cafeteria workers and janitors is what he calls ""a bad idea for a number of reasons.""

Helmke, a former mayor of Fort Wayne, official with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and now a professor at Indiana University, envisions all sorts of trouble -- from teachers accidentally shooting bystanders in a crisis to students finding stored weapons.

""It puts our students and our faculty at more risk,"" Helmke said.

The Indiana proposal mirrors an NRA plan unveiled last week. However, the NRA plan recommends 40 to 60 hours of training for teachers and school staffers who want to carry firearms. The organization said it would prefer police officers in schools but realized not every district could afford the cost.

But law enforcement officials say more than 60 hours of training would be needed to prepare someone for such a responsibility.

The Indiana Law Enforcement Academy devotes about 200 hours to training police officers in the use of deadly force.

""The use of force is the most critical thing we deal with,"" said Rusty Goodpaster, the academy's executive director. ""Target practice is one part but there is a whole mental decision making process.""

Police candidates go through hours and hours of simulator training just to become familiar with possible confrontations.

If a gunman bursts into a school, an officer must work through a mental checklist in the matter of seconds, then have the skill to act on it.

""Then there is the mental part of being prepared to deal with the consequences of taking someone else's life,"" he said.

Kevin Quinn, president of the National Association of School Resource Officers, said psychological readiness takes discipline, training and resolve.

""There has to be a singular focus,"" he said. ""If it isn't you are in trouble.""

""Mr. Smith, the history teacher, has a lot of other things to be worried about, teaching and tutoring kids,"" he said. ""Protecting the school and children has to be your only job.""

Someone who thinks those obstacles are not insurmountable -- and worth the risk given the carnage of mass school shootings -- is Noble County Sheriff Doug Harp.

Located 30 miles northwest of Fort Wayne, Noble County has 20 schools.

After Sandy Hook, Harp approached the schools with the idea of creating special deputies from the ranks of the school employees. He wanted to, train them in the use of firearms and tactics and give them psychological exams and stress tests -- the same training his officers must undergo. And he wanted them to work in schools carrying concealed weapons.

The idea was not only to make the guns inconspicuous but also to keep potential shooters from knowing who's packing. The schools agreed. Several employees came forward for training. But county commissioners and the company that provided worker's compensation insurance for the schools opposed of the idea.

As of now, Harp said, his program is ""dead in the water.""

That's why he was glad to see a similar idea draw a spark in the Indiana General Assembly. He said the reality is that, without an armed presence in schools, they always will be soft targets and body counts will be higher than in a school that's defended.

""We get there after the fact,"" Harp said of outside law enforcement. ""It's plain and simple. We're reactionary and we're not proactive when it comes to active shooters.""

Harp said teachers shouldn't just be handed a gun, but with training they can learn skills to keep their weapons secure and to know when to shoot and when not to shoot.

At a minimum, others say, armed school staffers would give a shooter a reason to pause.

""A gunman would now have to ask himself if there is someone in the school who is armed and is going to offer resistance,"" said Mike Hammond, executive director of the Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, an organization that lobbies to protect gun owner rights.

""It might change their mind about doing it in the first place. I think the deterrent effect would be substantially higher than the actual effect of a teacher ever using the gun.""

As with much in the debate, there are counter arguments.

Helmke, the former mayor and gun control advocate, pointed out that there was armed security at Columbine High School, site of a mass shooting in 1999. At Virginia Tech, terrorized in 2007, there was a police force.

""You always wish you had the scenario where the good guy had the gun and was able to take the John Wayne/James Bond kill shot and save the day,"" he said. ""Real life doesn't usually happen that way.""

Rather than requiring guns in schools, Helmke said, communities should decide whether and how to put armed adults in schools. Beyond that, they need to focus on more proven strategies -- making it tougher for intruders to enter a school, sniffing out problems early and doing more to keep guns out of the hands of the bad guys.

For some, the doubts about arming teachers and other school staffers are simply too much to overcome.

Amanda Olmstead, 33, had two sons in Martinsville Middle School West at the time of the 2011 shooting. But she says there are too many ""ifs.""

""I'm iffy on the whole issue of fighting guns with more guns,"" Olmstead said. ""I'm not comfortable with it.""

Story highlights Saturday is one-year anniversary of mass shooting at Newtown, Connecticut, school CNN and most other news organizations say they won't report from town on Saturday Newtown officials had urged media to respect families, not descend on the small town

(CNN) —

The nation’s news media are sure to cover the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School extensively on Saturday.

But for the most part, these news organizations say they will acquiesce to the requests of local community members and not report from Newtown, Connecticut, the town where Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished school on December 14, 2012. The massacre was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.

CNN said in a statement that while it “plans to cover the one-year anniversary across our networks and platforms, we are respecting the wishes of the families, and we are not reporting from Newtown on Saturday.”

Similarly, an NBC spokeswoman said in an e-mail that “NBC News is respecting the town’s wishes and our broadcasts have no plans to be in Newtown for the anniversary.” Other television networks issued almost identical statements when contacted.

Such decisions are exceptionally rare for news organizations and underline the tension between the necessity of covering tragedy and respecting the people who are being covered – in this case, parents with dead children and their neighbors.

What really makes schools safer?

In the run-up to the anniversary, Newtown officials said they hoped the press would not descend on the small town, stirring debate about what reporters should and should not do.

“We are wishing fervently that those many persons who wish us well, and the media, will allow us this time to be alone and quiet with time for personal and communal reflection,” said Pat Llodra, the town’s first selectman, a role similar to that of mayor.

But the job of journalists is, at times, to document such reflection and share it with the public. The Associated Press said it will provide “respectful coverage” of the anniversary Saturday, “as we have since Day One of Newtown’s tragedy.”

“As a news cooperative, owned by some 1,400 daily newspapers across the country, and as a provider of news and information to hundreds of other customers worldwide, AP also recognizes its obligation to report on how Newtown is coming together to mourn and heal,” a spokesman for the news organization said.

Many news organizations visited Newtown ahead of the anniversary to conduct reporting to televise and publish on Saturday. CBS News was among those, and the network signaled this week it would not have a camera crew in the town Saturday.

“We are sensitive to the families’ concerns and will cover the anniversary in the least intrusive way possible,” said Tim Gaughan, director of special events for CBS News.

Newtown residents plead for privacy

Newspaper and online journalists are generally able to maintain low profiles on sensitive assignments, with notebooks and cell phones the only necessary tools of the trade. Television journalists, on the other hand, are more often accompanied by intrusive cameras, microphones and trucks.

Like the national networks, local television stations in Connecticut have said they will avoid using Newtown as a backdrop for live shots.

Kelly McBride, an editor of the book “The New Ethics of Journalism: Principles for the 21st Century,” wrote in a Poynter Institute blog post Friday that it “would be wrong to leave the anniversary itself unnoticed,” but that such coverage can and should be done with sensitivity.

“We live in a media world of excess. With self-discipline, restraint and a sense of service to our audience – rather than to our ratings or web metrics – journalists should be able to provide meaningful stories a year after Newtown,” McBride wrote. “And possibly such efforts can set the tone for future tragedies.”

http://news.yahoo.com/us-gun-debate-overlooks-daily-violence-062907426.html,,[],US gun debate overlooks daily violence,"LARGO, Maryland (AP) — Florena Carter's shattered life didn't make national news.

Her son was killed on his 28th birthday in 2009. Carter's brother pulled the trigger. Her father shot himself soon afterward.

The horrifying family tragedy became one more private story in America's plague of gun violence. That year, 9,146 other people nationwide lost their lives in shootings.

The vast majority died in the type of daily gun violence that does not grab national headlines in the same way as the December massacre of 20 young children and six teachers at an elementary school in Connecticut, or the mass shooting last July in a Colorado movie theater that killed 12 people and wounded 70.

Those attacks became the focus of a bitter national debate over guns, which culminated with the defeat in the Senate of several proposals backed by President Barack Obama to tighten gun control laws, including banning military-style assault weapons and expanding background checks to stop criminals and the mentally ill from buying firearms.

Often lost in America's divisive gun control politics are the stories of people whose urban communities suffer the most from shootings every day. Although violent crime has been declining in the United States, it still far outstrips the rate of other developed countries. FBI figures show 8,583 people were killed by guns in 2011, the last year for which numbers were available.

That is nearly 24 people a day.

The figure is far higher when counting the number of people who kill themselves with guns. The federal Centers for Disease Control listed 19,392 gun suicides in the United States in 2010, the latest figures available.

Among the hard-hit places is Prince George's County, the Washington D.C. suburb where Stefan Carter was killed by his uncle 3 1/2 years ago. The county in the state of Maryland has long suffered under a reputation for violent crime, even though the U.S. Census Bureau lists it as the wealthiest majority African-American county in the country.

Story continues

Support for gun control tends to run high in places like Prince George's County. In other parts of the country, particularly states with large rural populations, people say firearms are essential for hunting and personal safety, a right that has been protected by the Second Amendment of the Constitution for more than 200 years.

As the American frontier expanded westward, gun ownership became culturally entrenched, and for many citizens, it remains a way of life. But other Americans believe the Second Amendment, adopted in 1791, no longer makes sense in modern urban settings like Prince George's County, where shootings tear at society.

Florena Carter, a 24-year veteran police officer, has concerns about the easy access to handguns for civilians. She is convinced that simply owning a gun made her brother more likely to use it.

Her son and her brother had been out on the town celebrating Stefan's birthday. When they were heading home, she said, her son tried to stop her brother from driving because the older man was intoxicated. They fought and Carter's brother pulled a handgun and shot Stefan.

Carter was at a loss to explain how the dispute escalated. The two men had been close; neither was prone to violence, Carter said.

""All I can think is that it was the alcohol and that he had a gun,"" she said.

That argument goes counter to rhetoric often cited by U.S. gun advocates who say that gun restrictions can't stop people who are determined to misuse guns. What's more, they argue, such shootings among family members should not deny law-abiding citizens from owning guns for self-protection.

Since the Connecticut school shooting, many gun-rights activists have insisted the solution is for more people to own guns, not fewer. Politicians in some states have proposed laws allowing school teachers to carry guns, arguing that shooters will be less likely to target public places where they know people are armed. Supporters argue that restricting firearms rights will only prevent people from defending themselves from criminals who will find a way to get guns no matter what.

But in Prince George's County, Carter doesn't buy the argument that guns make people safer. Last year, she worked with a county program known as Gift Cards for Guns, which allows people to anonymously turn in their weapons in exchange for a $100 gift card.

Carter said she had not known her brother owned a handgun but was told by police that he had bought it legally.

Maryland recently passed a law that will make it tougher to buy such guns. One of the toughest gun control measures in the country, Maryland's law requires licensing, fingerprinting, and safety training to purchase a handgun, bans the sale of 45 types of assault weapons and limits ammunition magazine capacity to 10 rounds.

The National Rifle Association, the most powerful gun rights lobby in the country, is expected to challenge the Maryland statute in the courts, delaying its going into force.

Maryland is among several states that passed tougher gun control measures in response to the Connecticut school shooting, even as the push for stricter federal laws died in the Senate. Among them was Colorado, a state with a proud frontier tradition where gun ownership is common.

That has given hope to some advocates that gun control might be gaining ground despite fierce opposition by the deep-pocketed NRA, which spends heavily in U.S. elections. Although Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the Senate defeated the push for expanded background checks, polls at the time showed that about 90 percent of Americans favor such a measure.

Maryland has routinely had the 2nd highest homicide rate per 100,000 residents of all 50 states, despite also having the 5th highest per capita income. It had a gun deaths rate of 6.8 per 100,000 in 2011, more than 2 percentage points higher than the national average of 4.7 per 100,000.

That is due in large part to crime in Prince Georges County and the economically hard-hit city of Baltimore, according to the FBI and Census Bureau. Gun deaths have fallen dramatically in Prince Georges as the county government implements aggressive policies to build up the six most troubled neighborhoods, from programs to keep students in school to better street lighting, road repairs and demolition of abandoned buildings. The number of homicides has fallen from a high of 169 in 2005 to 64 last year.

Homicides are dropping similarly in other U.S. cities, prompting some to argue stricter gun measures are not needed to combat daily violence. But Prince Georges police chief Mark Magaw has welcomed Maryland's tough new gun law as a strong crime-fighting tool in his still-violent county.

So does Carter, who told her story at a gathering of other women coping with the loss of family members to gun violence. They have all been counseled by a group known as Community Advocates for Family and Youth.

Carter, now a board member of the organization, said she was still suffering despite sessions with police department psychologists when she found CAFY. Her husband had died of leukemia just five months before her son was killed.

""I thought, 'my God couldn't do that to me,'"" she said.

Carter dabbed away tears as she recalled the early December morning 3 ½ years ago when the phone rang with the news of her son's death.

""My son was my only child. I don't have any grandchildren, and now I don't have hope of any,"" she said. ""My son was two classes short of graduating with a dual degree.""

In the passing weeks, Carter said she noticed that her father appeared increasingly depressed. She figured it was a natural reaction to the tragedy — until he killed himself.

Her brother will be out of prison in about two years, serving a sentence shortened because he accepted a plea deal. Carter doesn't know if she can forgive him.

""I love my brother. I've known him longer than my son. I changed his diapers,"" she said. But when he's released, ""I just can't see us having a relationship."""
http://news.yahoo.com/nra-arapahoe-shooting-191113337.html,,[],"NRA: 'Good guy with a gun,' not gun control, stopped Arapahoe High rampage","The National Rifle Association says the Arapahoe High School shooting is proof that an ""armed response"" to school massacres — putting more ""good guys with guns"" in schools — works, and that Colorado's new gun control laws, passed in the wake of the 2012 theater massacre in Aurora, did nothing to keep guns ""out of the hands of bad guys.""

""Gun control laws didn't stop a possible massacre at Arapahoe High School,"" the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action wrote in a letter to its members on Friday. ""A good guy with a gun stopped the rampage and in doing so almost certainly prevented much greater harm. For that, we can all be thankful.""

Claire Davis, a 17-year-old student, was shot at point-blank range as she sat in a hallway at the school on Dec. 13. ""As bad as that was,"" the NRA wrote, ""things could have been much worse.""

Davis died Saturday. The 18-year-old gunman — a senior who was reportedly armed with a shotgun, about 125 rounds of ammunition, three Molotov cocktails and a machete — killed himself before carrying out what authorities believe was a planned killing spree.

""The attacker's mission was stopped short by the quick response of an armed deputy sheriff who was working as a resource officer at the school,"" the letter continued. ""Upon learning of the threat, the deputy ran from the cafeteria to the library, yelling for people to get down and identifying himself as a deputy sheriff. The horrific incident lasted only a total of 80 seconds and ended with the shooter turning his gun on himself in the library as the deputy was closing in on him.""

During a Dec. 15 appearance on ""Face The Nation,"" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said the gun control laws passed in Colorado in March ""are going to make us safer, but in this specific case aren't going to make a difference at all. And that's the challenge.""

""What does make a difference is an armed response,"" the NRA letter said. ""But it only works in a situation where properly secured firearms are available onsite to be used by responsible, proficient, courageous people — in other words, the good guys.""

A week after the Dec. 14, 2012, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the NRA argued that gun control legislation would not prevent similar shootings, calling for a nationwide program that would place armed security in every school desiring protection.

""I call on Congress today to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation,"" NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre said at a press conference in Washington. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."""

Pendleton, an honor student and band majorette at King College Prep, had participated in inaugural festivities near Washington about a week before her death.

The White House announced today that the first lady would attend the Saturday morning services at Greater Harvest Baptist Church on the South Side. The first lady is not expected to make public remarks, and the Obamas’ daughters, Malia and Sasha, are not expected to accompany their mother.

“As a mother and Chicagoan, the first lady was heartbroken to learn of the tragic loss of Hadiya Pendleton due to senseless gun violence,” said Kristina Schake, communications director for Michelle Obama. “Too many times, we’ve seen young people struck down with so much of their lives ahead of them. The first lady is traveling to her funeral on Saturday to offer her condolences and support to Hadiya’s family and loved ones.”

Scheduled to speak at the funeral is Gov. Pat Quinn, who mentioned Pendleton during his annual State of the State speech on Wednesday as he called for tougher gun control measures. Quinn said he spoke to the teen’s family this week.



""There are no words in the English language, or any language, to relieve the pain of parents who lose a child,"" said Quinn, who has two adult sons.



A White House source said senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Education Secretary Arne Duncan also will attend the funeral. Both are Chicagoans.

Community activists had urged the Obamas to come to Chicago to speak out about recent violence. A petition on the White House website had called on the Obamas to attend Pendleton’s funeral.

The president reached out to the family last week to offer his condolences, according to people close to the family. Early on, the family had expressed concern that the president’s attendance would overshadow the funeral and make it difficult for Pendleton’s many friends to say their goodbyes to her.

After learning today that the first lady planned to attend, Shatira Wilks, a cousin who serves as the family’s spokesperson, said they are still committed to making the funeral a celebration of the teen’s life.

“It’s a nice gesture and we appreciate it,” Wilks said. “But that is who we are.”

Those close to the family said the parents are still trying to come to grips with what has happened.

“It’s a lot to take in. It’s an overwhelming experience,” said LaKeisha Stewart, Hadiya’s godmother. “We are very thankful the people are coming to support the family. We realize that this young lady has touched a lot of people and this goes beyond us.”

Pendleton was killed at Harsh Park on Jan. 29, near the end of the deadliest January for Chicago homicides in a decade. There is a $40,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the teen’s death.

Visitation is scheduled for 2 to 9 p.m. Friday in Calahan Funeral Home at 7030 S. Halsted St. On Saturday, the wake continues at 9 a.m. followed by the funeral at 11 a.m. in Greater Harvest Baptist Church, 5141 S. State St.

Washington (CNN) – Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky argued Wednesday morning President Obama is using the families of victims from the Newtown elementary school shooting for political purposes and compared them to ""props"" in the ongoing gun control debate.

His comments later elicited a fiery response from Obama after the Senate voted down a proposal to expand background checks on firearm purchases.



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'] [twitter-follow screen_name='KilloughCNN']

Talking about the gun control legislation at a Washington breakfast with reporters, Paul said the issue is a legitimate subject to debate but said it was unfortunate that families who have suffered from gun violence are being drawn into the political scene on Capitol Hill.

""In some cases, I think the president has used them as props,"" he said.

A number of Newtown families traveled to Washington in recent weeks to lobby senators as the upper chamber considered tougher gun laws.

One of the main amendments of a gun package, however, failed to gain enough support in the vote Wednesday after nearly all Republicans and four Democrats opposed the legislation, saying it doesn't address the problem of gun violence.

(Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also voted no at the last minute for procedural reasons, allowing him to bring the amendment back up at a later date.)

""I've seen the fathers and mothers testifying,"" Paul said, adding he's aware they came voluntarily and wanted to be part of the debate. ""It still saddens me just to see them.""

Pressed later during the breakfast about his comment referring to ""props,"" Paul said he wants people to know that he cares about those families.

""I'm someone who's presenting a face to the public. The face I want to present is that I do care about those kids and I understand the grief that (the families) are going through,"" he said. ""Politics isn't only about facts. It is about whether you're seen as being empathetic and I do want people to know that I do care about those families and I care about their grief.

Following Wednesday's vote, Obama appeared in the Rose Garden with Newtown families and angrily chided those who opposed the measure. And in a somewhat veiled swipe, the president addressed Paul's comment.

""I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced–a 'prop,' somebody called it,"" he said. ""Are they serious? Do they really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence don't have a right to weigh in on this issue? Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?""

""So all in all, this was a pretty shameful day in Washington,"" he added.

Paul was one of the Republican senators who conducted a filibuster of the bill, preventing it from moving forward last week. However, their filibuster was overcome when the Senate obtained the 60 votes it needed to proceed with the legislation.

The senator said he didn't consider the background check proposal, which expands the system to cover private sales at gun shows and online, as a solution to gun violence, arguing those who commit mass shootings are going to do so no matter what.

Instead, he favors strengthening the current background check system and allowing teachers to keep guns in the classroom as a way to protect students.

The current actions on the Hill, he argued, are akin to ""window dressing.""

""It's a dog and pony show, it's a parade, it's theatrics,"" he said, adding some lawmakers just want to be able to say they ""did something"" on gun violence, even if it's not effective in the end.

Also at the breakfast with reporters, Paul confirmed he was considering a presidential bid and outlined further plans for his travel to early primary states this year.

""We're considering it, but we won't make a decision before 2014,"" he said at the breakfast, sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.

Paul is scheduled to travel to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire next month, but he said he's also adding South Carolina to his itinerary this summer.

""Whether I run or not, I would consider it as something that allows me to have a larger microphone,"" he said."

They live in Newtown, Conn.

Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence is the latest in a series of events following the Dec. 14shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Our 7-year-old son, Daniel, 19 of his first-grade classmates and six educators were killed in the tragedy. We believe this hearing is an opportunity to rise above the hard-line rhetoric and intransigence that too often lead to inaction and hopelessness, and we hope that our leaders and our nation will start a new conversation with a chance of achieving real change.

Our Daniel was a constant source of laughter and joy. He was intelligent, articulate, incredibly affectionate, fair, thoughtful toward others and unfailingly polite. Daniel believed in holding doors open for strangers. He talked to the person sitting alone. He loved to help clean up a mess, and he made sure there was enough milk for everyone before adding it to his cereal.

His kindergarten teacher recently wrote to us: “He is the kind of student that should come wrapped in ribbon because he is a gift to his teachers. I can remember leaving notes for our substitute to ‘ask Daniel’ if she or he needed help with anything.”

Motivated by Daniel’s empathy and kindness, one of our relatives created a Facebook page, “What Would Daniel Do?,” to inspire others to reach out as our youngest son did.

As lawmakers and others discuss what can be done to curb gun violence, we hope Americans will ask, What would Daniel do?

Daniel would listen and be respectful. Our country needs a new dialogue, one that doesn’t follow the tired script of political squabbling. Any improvement to our laws, no matter how small or reasonable, should not be decried as the forward wave of an attempt to “ban guns” or “take away rights.” Even those of us who have lost the most are suggesting no such thing.

Daniel would be honest. We know that there are no easy answers to these multifaceted issues. Anyone who suggests that a single law would “solve the problem” isn’t telling the truth. But neither is anyone who says that changes in our laws can’t make a difference.

Daniel wouldn’t give up hope. We refuse to accept the status quo. Making our society safer will require sustained, comprehensive action by individuals as well as by communities and government. As parents, there is nothing more important to us than our relationship with our children. Every parent can start right there, in their own home. On a broader level, it is urgent that we address the gaps in our mental health system and examine school security. We must have the same open dialogue about gun responsibility and accountability. The parental desire to love and protect our children is common ground for gun owners and non-gun owners alike.

We have joined with other families, neighbors and friends in making the Sandy Hook Promise (www.sandyhookpromise.org). We hope every member of Congress and Americans nationwide will join us in pledging to honor the lives lost last month by coming together to end these violent tragedies.

Our Daniel wanted to be a fireman like his uncles. He played drums in our family band, and he could run like the wind. Until Dec. 14, Daniel’s future was limited only by the size of his dreams.

Our son’s future was stolen from him: There will be no firehouse, no more rock band, no Boston Marathon.

But if our nation uses this moment to make the future brighter for other children, Daniel’s life and the lives of his classmates and educators will have meaning for years to come.

Our nation’s ability to deal with gun violence is limited only by the civility of our discourse, the scope of our ambitions and — as Daniel would have done — our willingness to come together and take action."

The report includes material gathered by state and local police, as well as by federal investigators, who tried to glean information from the computer hard drive of gunman Adam Lanza.

Lanza damaged the computer before shooting his way into the Newtown school shortly after classes had begun. Armed with three weapons that had belonged to his mother, Nancy Lanza, the gunman killed 20 first-graders and six adults in the school before shooting himself to death. Earlier that morning, he had shot to death Nancy Lanza.

WHO THEY WERE: Newtown shooting victims

“The investigation of this incident is unparalleled in the one hundred and ten year history of the Connecticut State Police,” said Reuben F. Bradford, commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, in a letter accompanying the massive trove of files.

“I hope that the release of this report, though painful, will allow those who have been affected by it to continue in their personal process of healing and will provide helpful information that can be put to use to prevent such tragedies in the future,” Bradford said.

Some of the documents record how police, often accompanied by clergy and social workers, visited the families of those slain in the Sandy Hook shooting.

One investigative report describes how Trooper Rafael Figueiral went to a home with Father Michael Novajosky to inform relatives that Victoria Soto, a first-grade teacher, was among those killed at the school.

PHOTOS: Newtown school shooting

“Father Novajosky offered a prayer to which they gladly accepted,” the report states.

Some of the material has been redacted, but the trooper notes that the relative agreed to tell others of the visit.

In addition to photographs and videos, the files include detailed descriptions of victims’ belongings retrieved and returned to their families: jewelry, eyeglass cases, earrings and hair clips. It also included diagrams of the interior of the school, noting the location of bullet casings and magazines found strewn in the hallways and classrooms.

The report also revealed the breadth of Lanza’s gunfire, describing bullet holes found on the car of one victim that was parked in the school’s parking lot. The vehicle, a Honda with a decal on the truck that read “I (heart-shaped symbol) my cat,” had three “suspected bullet strikes” on the outside, according to one of the thousands of brief police reports summarizing the scene.

At least one other car in the lot also had damage from bullets, according to police reports. It was not clear whether the bullet holes came from Lanza’s gun or the police.

Much of the material is heavily redacted, in keeping with state laws that prohibit showing photographs of homicide victims. Names and other identifying information of most witnesses have also been redacted.

But the hours of videos included in the report are chilling nonetheless, showing the school just a few hours after Lanza’s rampage, some classrooms appearing untouched, with scenes of elementary school games and other activities clearly visible.

One video, though, shows what appears to be a magazine from one of Lanza’s weapons on the floor of the school hallway.

Items found inside the Lanza home included a card, dated June 10, 1999, from the Sandy Hook school, and addressed to Nancy Lanza. The card thanked her “for being such a special volunteer” at the school’s 5th grade “stepping-up ceremony.”

Pictures inside the Lanza home showed a colored photograph of a young boy holding a gun, with ammunition spread across his lap, and Nancy Lanza’s shoes lined up in neat rows beneath her bed, not far from the bullet casings found on the floor. One shows her bed, a large stain of blood on the white sheets.

Written in the kind of bureaucratic language often used by police investigators, the documents nevertheless paint a picture of families trying to cope with the painful shooting and officers, social workers and clergy trying to be helpful.

One trooper describes his visit to a family the day after the shooting to tell them that their son had been positively identified from photographs as one of those killed. The visit is described in the sparsest language, with names redacted to protect privacy.

“We remained with the [redacted] family at their residence for a period of time before returning to the command post,” the trooper writes, but gives no details of what was discussed.

The reports go on to describe the return of personal effects such as cellphones and clothing. One redacted report notes that a “backpack, lunchbox and two toys were returned” to relatives about a month after the shooting.

The release had been expected following last month’s unsealing of a summary of the findings. That summary, written by the state’s attorney for the Danbury region, Stephen Sedensky III, shed light on Lanza’s mental illness and on the troubled home he shared with his mother in an upscale area of Newtown.

It showed that Nancy Lanza worried about her son’s isolation and obvious mental illness but that she allowed him to dictate rules of the house, including banning her from his bedroom and not allowing her to put up a Christmas tree or have a cat in the house.

Adam Lanza kept his bedroom windows covered in black plastic and rarely went out, except to go to a local cinema and play hours of Dance Dance Revolution, in which a player on a platform moves his feet as directed by a video. As he grew more isolated, Lanza spoke to his mother only via email or text, Sedensky’s summary said.

Nancy Lanza had several legally purchased and registered guns in their home, along with ammunition. Her son used those weapons to kill Nancy Lanza as she lay in bed the morning of the Sandy Hook attack. He then drove to the elementary school, about five miles away, and opened fire.

The shootings led to calls for stricter gun-control laws at the federal level. But Washington lawmakers backed down from legislation that would have required universal background checks on all firearm purchases and limited magazine sizes.

(CNN) —

Another day, another mass shooting in America.

More blood, more tears, more knee-jerk rhetoric about finding a solution for a bunch of different problems.

Those who knew Aaron Alexis – the shooter who killed 12 and injured eight more at the Washington Navy Yard this week – said he was a quiet, shy man.

ESPN LZ Granderson

At one point he was studying Buddhism and meditated often.

A little more digging, and we find he had several gun-related arrests and a pattern of misconduct in the Navy, but he was honorably discharged.

Pieces of a puzzle we may never fully put together.

But the fact that there is still so much we don’t know about Alexis – or the motive behind the shootings – won’t detour gun-control advocates from lumping his story in with that of Adam Lanza, the man police say is responsible for the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, along with the victims from gang- and drug-related shootings.

This is why after the tears have dried and the blood washes away, little, if anything, will change.

And because gun-control advocates so often try to cobble together every distinct narrative involving guns into a one-size-fits-all conversation, they are as much to blame for this merry-go-round as the gun lobbyists against whom they fight.

Gun shops are illegal in Chicago.

Opinion: What could have prevented carnage?

The city has bans on both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And yet each week people continue to die in the streets from gunshot wounds.

This conundrum is just one example why making note that more Americans have died from gun violence here at home since Newtown than in the nine years fighting a war in Iraq is the kind of factoid that grabs our attention but undermines the true goal: curtailing the violence.

Not all deaths involving guns are the same – therefore trying to address each incident from the same point of view is futile. Until we learn more about Alexis – the events leading up to the shootings and the motive – the tragedy in Washington should not be used as catalyst for a conversation about gun control.

Instead, we should mourn and wait for more information.

Far too often assumptions surrounding the details of tragedies such as the one in Washington are made, and well-intentioned stances fall apart when additional facts come to light.

The guns James Holmes was charged with using in Aurora were purchased legally. Beyond the presence of a gun, the crimes committed in the movie theater are not at all similar to what happens in the streets of our large cities. And each time a politician or gun-control advocate tries to use these two very different examples interchangeably, the entire conversation and argument are compromised.

This happened after Newtown.

It happened after Aurora.

And it will keep continue to happen until the advocates accept that ridding the country of guns is a hopeless – and unconstitutional mission – and that the real goal should be addressing the factors that lead to the various forms of gun violence: factors such as poverty, mental health and failing schools.

Last month the nation breathed a sigh of relief after Antoinette Tuff, a bookkeeper in an elementary school in suburban Atlanta, prevented a man with an AK-47-type weapon and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition from hurting anyone.

It was not the time to talk generally about gun violence in this country. It was the time to discuss specifics such as cuts to mental health and its impact on services, given that the suspect, 20-year-old Michael Brandon Hill, has a long history of mental disorders. Hill’s storyline is similar to that of Lanza, and there are questions whether Holmes, the admitted shooter in the Aurora movie theater, is insane.

Public debates with Wayne LaPierre and attacks on the National Rifle Association have proven to be an ineffective way to prevent gun violence. In the wake of the Washington Navy Yard killings, perhaps a new strategy, one that doesn’t involve playing on the nation’s emotions or challenging the relevance of the Second Amendment, should be employed. That’s not saying the NRA has won – in fact, I think LaPierre should step down because each time he opens his mouth, he steps in it – but at the end of the day the organization is more of an agitator than the enemy.

The folks spraying our cities with bullets are not NRA members or even legal gun owners. LZ Granderson

There is no one enemy.

Thus there is no one solution.

Because like it or not, the folks spraying our cities with bullets are not NRA members or legal gun owners. And despite the tendency to tie it all together, they have nothing to do with the Adam Lanzas of the world.

And it’s too early to know how Alexis fits in the conversation.

According to a count by USA Today, more than 900 people have been killed in mass shootings since 2006. The thousands of other victims of gun violence over the past seven years died from many different circumstances, requiring different conversations.

This is why gun-control advocates need to abandon the routine of using mass shootings to turn law-abiding citizens into social pariahs and instead focus on something that could work.

The FAA released a statement in response to questions about an ordinance under consideration in the tiny farming community of Deer Trail, Colo., that would encourage hunters to shoot down drowns. The administration reminded the public that it regulates the nation's airspace, including the airspace over cities and towns.

""I want to take a stand against the coming surveillance society that seems to be rushing in on us,"" Phillip Steel, a resident in town who drafted the ordinance and submitted it for approval by the town board, told ""Fox and Friends.""

Officials in the town admit they have never seen a drone plane on the Eastern Plains, but they want to make a statement that they think using unmanned surveillance planes to spy on people in the United States is wrong. They say the ordinance is mostly symbolic. They also recognize it's against federal law to destroy federal property.

The FAA for its part said a drone ""hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air. Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil liability, just as would firing at a manned airplane.""

Under the proposed ordinance, Deer Trail would grant hunting permits to shoot drones. The permits would cost $25 each. The town would also encourage drone hunting by awarding $100 to anyone who presents a valid hunting license and identifiable pieces of a drone that has been shot down.

AIR FORCE DRONE CRASHES, CLOSES FLORIDA ROAD

Steel, 48, said in an interview that he has 28 signatures on a petition — roughly 10 percent of the town's registered voters. Under Colorado law, that requires local officials to formally consider the proposal at a meeting next month. Town officials would then have the option of adopting the ordinance or putting it on the ballot in an election this fall, he said.

The proposed ordinance is mostly a symbolic protest against small, civilian drones that are coming into use in the United States, Steel said. He acknowledged that it's unlikely there are any drones in use near Deer Trail.

The head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation acknowledged in June that his agency uses drones to conduct surveillance in the United States, but said they do so rarely, The Wall Street Journal reported . FBI director Robert Mueller said the agency uses them ""in a very, very minimal way, very seldom.""

Federal agencies have been using drones for years to monitor the northern and southern borders of the U.S., and those drones have occasionally been deployed to help domestic law-enforcement agencies like the FBI."

USA TODAY

Defense lawyer O%27Mara says President Obama should acknowledge Zimmerman%27s pain

Prosecutors say Zimmerman lied his way to freedom

Zimmerman was acquitted in state court but could face federal charges

SANFORD, Fla -- The prosecutors who tried to get George Zimmerman convicted believe he got away with murdering Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's lawyer says everyone -- including President Obama -- should know that Zimmerman was wrongly charged and should recognize the unjust trauma brought upon him.

Two days after Zimmerman's acquittal, lawyers from both sides, in interviews with USA TODAY, talked about the aftermath of a verdict that continues to reverberate across the nation.

Prosecutors say Zimmerman profiled, tracked down, and murdered an innocent 17 year old -- and then lied his way out of a conviction. Zimmerman's lawyer says he will seek immunity from any further legal action against his client and thinks Obama should publicly recognize the suffering endured by Zimmerman and his family.

""He (Zimmerman) called the police and then he decided to become the police,"" said State Attorney Angela Corey, adding that Zimmerman deserved to be charged with murder. ""George Zimmerman used excessive and deadly force and that's what made it a violation of Florida law.""

She added that she respects the jury's verdict.

Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said Zimmerman is prepared to legally defend himself against any actions in the future -- including the possibility of a federal civil rights prosecution and civil lawsuit.

""The FBI looked into that last year, interviewed about 40 people and not one person came up with any suggestion that George acted in a racially inappropriate way,"" O'Mara said of the federal investigation.

Zimmerman would also seek immunity from any civil lawsuits, O'Mara added.

A federal investigation into the shooting death of Trayvon is underway, and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida criminal trial, the Justice Department said Sunday in a written statement.

Attorney General Eric Holder briefly discussed the case Monday.

""We are committed to standing with the people of Sanford, with the individuals and families affected by this incident, and with our state and local partners in order to alleviate tensions, address community concerns and promote healing,"" Holder said. ""And we will never stop working to ensure that – in every case, in every circumstance and in every community – justice must be done.''

Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated townhouse community here, shot and killed Trayvon on Feb. 26, 2012, as the teen returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he shot the unarmed African-American teenager in self-defense.

A jury deliberated for more than 15 hours before finding Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter Saturday.

In a statement issued Sunday, Obama called Trayvon's death a tragedy for America but made no mention of race.

""I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,"" Obama said. ""But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.""

He called for calm and national introspection.

""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities,"" he said. ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.""

O'Mara said the president's statement should have been more fair and compassionate to Zimmerman and his family.

Obama has ""already made a couple of comments now about Trayvon Martin and I think he should have maybe focused a bit more on the fact that a fair trial was held, that justice was served, and that the Zimmerman family has gone through their own trauma in this. I don't know that it needs to be a one-sided conversation. I don't think that helps,"" O'Mara said.

Corey had this to say about when asked about Obama's statement: ""I don't have a reaction to any other public official commenting on our case. The relevant people are the jury and the people in the courtroom.""

Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda, who argued before the jury, said Zimmerman was prosecuted using the best evidence the state had.

""This is an issue about whether you are going to allow a citizen to take the law into his own hands,"" de la Rionda said. ""I prosecuted this case because you had a man who decided to make assumptions -- the assumptions turned out to be wrong and as a result a young man --a 17 year old teenager--was killed.""

The prosecutor went on saying he respects the jury's verdict, but after Zimmerman profiled Trayvon as a criminal, Zimmerman used that assumption to murder the teen.

""He (Zimmerman) called the police but he didn't just finish there,"" de la Rionda said. ""He (Zimmerman) then trailed him (Trayvon). Tracked him. Followed him and ended up confronting him.""

Meanwhile, O'Mara has continued to say the shooting, which is the subject of demonstrations nationwide, has been wrongly cast as a civil rights one.

""This verdict still has nothing to do with civil rights,"" O'Mara said. ""There's enormous evidence that my client acted in self-defense. There is no other reasonable hypothesis.""

O'Mara added, however, that had Zimmerman been black, he would never have been prosecuted.

Corey balked at the idea that race played any role in charging Zimmerman, saying her office doesn't consider the race of a defendant or victim unless the crime includes a racial motivation such as a hate crime.

""I know that in this circuit we handle every case based on the facts and the law without regard to race or gender,"" she said. ""When it comes to the race or gender or age of a victim or a defendant, unless it's legally relevant, it's not part of the filing decision.""

Instead, de la Rionda said prosecutors focused on what evidence they had and tried their best but failed.

Days later, de la Rionda said he wished he handled the case from the very night Trayvon was killed. He also said he was prepared to cross examine Zimmerman, who did not take the stand in his own defense.

Now, however, lawyers for both sides are recovering from long work days and Zimmerman is settling back into life as a free man.

People, de la Rionda said, also got a good understanding of how the American judicial system works by watching the nationally televised trial: ""It's very educational to inform the public out there of the way our system works."""

Wallace pointed out that the president's children face a larger threat than most. ""Tell that to the people at Newtown,"" LaPierre replied, referring to the town where an armed shooter killed 20 young children at an elementary school in December. ""Do you really think that the president's children are the same kind of target as every schoolchild in America?"" Wallace asked. ""It's ridiculous, and you know it, sir.""

For LaPierre to justify his abhorrent political ad by bringing up the children of Newtown is just despicable, and Chris Wallace rightly put him in his place.

LaPierre also lies about gun registry and Chris Wallace smacks him down:



He predicted a universal gun registry is next -- a measure that, as Wallace reminded him, has not been proposed. ""Forgive me, sir, but you take something that is here and you say it's going to go all the way over there,"" Wallace said. ""There's no indication -- I mean, I can understand your saying that's the threat, but there's nothing that anyone in the administration has said that indicates they're going to have a universal registry."" ""And Obamacare wasn't a tax until they needed it to be a tax,"" he said.

""well it was the supreme court that said that [Obamacare is a tax]"".

The argument that Obamacare is a tax was made, primarily, by the conservative Justice John Roberts, so LaPierre is using a conservative argument to show that Obama is a liar. My mind is officially blown at this man's insane logic. Many Kossacks have also pointed out that Obamacare has nothing to do with guns, so now he is just reduced to parroting Tea Party talking points. And look at how fast Wallace points outChris Wallace is not having this nonsense on his show! And all LaPierre can do, is ignore that statement, since he doesn't have a retort, and say ""I don't think you can trust these people."" He then tries to pivot to his talking points, but Wallace says ""forgive me sir, I'm going to conduct this interview"". Wow. Brilliant stuff!

When, Chris Wallace says that Obama ""is not taking away shotguns"", LaPierre, lies and says that the Feinstein bill does include such a clause. NO ONE is taking away shot guns or hand guns. This man is LYING.

And finally, offered without comment, since it's been beaten into the ground:



""If you limit the American public's access to semi-automatic technology, you limit their ability to survive,"" LaPierre said.

But I would also like to point out that with main stream conservatives like Chris Wallace distancing themselves from this nonsense, we may be winning the debate."

(CNN) —

You know things in Chicago are bad when 70 murders in the first quarter can be seen as a good thing. But context is everything: Last year at this time there had been more than 120 murders, so I guess we should thank God for small favors.

It seems inconceivable that the city President Barack Obama calls home is also the city where his family may be least safe. Just this Monday a 15-year-old boy was found shot dead in a backyard only four blocks from the president’s house.

ESPN LZ Granderson

What’s responsible for the bloodshed? Gang violence, as usual. Police estimate that of the 532 murders in 2012 – nearly 1.5 a day – about 80 percent were gang related. And yet, despite that rather staggering statistic, the national outcry is muted at best – nothing, to say the least, like the kind we saw last week in Boston. What is it about the word “gang” that brings out the apathy in us? Would we view Chicago differently if we called the perpetrators something else?

In Chicago, nurses dodge bullets to provide care

I’m not saying the people of Boston do not deserve our sympathy; they do. Nor am I suggesting the apprehension of Boston terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not essential. But how do we explain our habit of greeting terrorists with 24-hour news coverage and relentless wrath while overlooking the gangs that terrorize our streets daily – as if terrorism were only an enemy state and not a concept.

The murder numbers may be slightly better in Chicago, but they do not fully communicate the city’s state of siege. In February CNN reported that some children living in gang-ridden parts of the city carry guns because, to them, getting caught and serving time for possession of a gun is better than getting caught without one and dying.

Last month, city officials announced the closure of 54 “under-resourced” schools, which will force some kids to walk across warring gang territory to get to school. For example, in the seven blocks between George Manierre Elementary and Jenner Elementary there are three gangs fighting over territory: Black P Stones, Conservative Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples.

Kids and guns: ‘These are not isolated tragedies’

If it all sounds scary, it’s only because it is.

And if the name attached to all of this violence were al-Qaeda instead of Gangster Disciples; or if instead of “gang violence” the bloodshed were called “terrorism;” or if instead of calling the people spreading fear and mayhem gangs we were to call them what they really are – terrorists – the nation would demand more be done.

After all, if children are afraid to walk to school because they might get killed or if residents are afraid to identify perpetrators for fear of retaliation, I think it’s safe to say they are being terrorized.

What seems like a linguistic shell game is really an exercise in empathy. The thought of elementary school kids walking across areas of a city controlled by three terrorist groups becomes unacceptable to everyone, not just their parents. Hearing that 25 Chicagoans were shot in one weekend becomes a threat to national security, and not just the mayor’s problem.

The story of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was caught in the crossfire of a turf war days after performing during the presidential inauguration, was of interest briefly but her story has since faded. She, too, died just a few blocks from the Obama’s home. Jonylah Watkins, a 6-month-old girl, was shot in March while sitting on the lap of her father, Jonathan, the intended target and a gang member.

Opinion: Chicago’s violence took my dad, friends

Last week, millions watched as an entire city was shut down to look for one guy. Every major news station was covering the pursuit of one guy. We all know the face and relatives of this one guy. And it’s all because he is an alleged terrorist. But more American were murdered in the south and west sides of Chicago than there were U.S. servicemen killed in Afghanistan last year, and yet for some reason we don’t view those neighborhoods as terrorized.

Last week, Abdella Ahmad Tounisi was arrested at O’Hare Airport because the FBI believed he was on his way to Syria to join a terrorist organization. Tounisi reportedly thought he was in contact with a recruiter for a jihadist militant group, but it was actually an FBI agent. I would love to see the FBI’s anti-terrorism resources used in that matter to stop would-be gang members from flooding the streets of the country’s third-largest city. Maybe Cornelius German, the boy found dead down the street from Obama’s house, would still be alive.

Maybe Pendleton, who was playing in a park with her friends, would still be alive. Maybe Watkins, who was sitting on her father’s lap, would have had a chance to live.

Their deaths wouldn’t be considered “Chicago’s problem” if authorities suspected terrorists were involved. But it’s “gang-related,” so…

Victims and relatives of those killed in massacres in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Tucson and elsewhere visited 25 cities by bus over the summer. The tour’s final stop was Thursday in Washington.

Victims and relatives of those killed in massacres in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Tucson and elsewhere visited 25 cities by bus over the summer. The tour’s final stop was Thursday in Washington.

Victims and relatives of those killed in massacres in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Tucson and elsewhere visited 25 cities by bus over the summer. The tour’s final stop was Thursday in Washington.

The survivors took their places onstage from memory, because by now they knew exactly where to go. The shooting victims in wheelchairs entered first, rolling into the front row, wearing bracelets engraved with the words “Aurora,” “Oak Creek” or “Virginia Tech.” Behind them stood a dozen people in black T-shirts who held memorial photos of relatives killed in America’s most infamous mass shootings. In the far back were politicians holding copies of their speeches and gun-control activists waving signs, including one that read: “How many more victims does it take?”

Minutes before the rally began, two of the speakers walked across the lawn of the U.S. Capitol toward the stage. One of them, Stephen Barton, had been shot at a midnight movie premiere in Aurora, Colo., and he had deferred a teaching position in Russia so he could recover from having 16 shotgun pellets surgically removed from his arm, neck and face. The other, Carlee Soto, was taking a semester off from community college because the desks reminded her of the first-grade classroom in Newtown, Conn., where her sister had taught.

“We have to make people understand what it feels like,” Barton told her.

“It has to make their skin crawl,” she said. “It needs to physically hurt.”

“Make them uncomfortable,” he agreed.

Their event in Washington on Thursday was the final stop of a 100-day summer bus tour: 25 rallies in 25 states organized by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, involving more than a hundred survivors who told their stories and showed their scars, hoping to inflame a country that they fear has gone numb.

They traveled by bus to mark six months since Newtown and the first anniversaries of gunfire at a movie theater in Aurora and a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis. They went to Ohio, where a gun rights counter-rally drew twice the crowd; and to Fargo, N.D., where the mayor told them guns didn’t present a problem.

Then, just last week, hours before the bus arrived in Washington, a dozen people were slain at the Washington Navy Yard.

Another Newtown. Another Aurora or Oak Creek.

Now Barton stepped up to the lectern in Washington and studied a crowd that included some of the latest survivors of a mass shooting. The 100-day bus tour had not been enough to change national gun laws. Trips to lobby in Washington had not been enough. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s money had not been enough. Neither had 20 first-graders, or 70 people killed or wounded in a Colorado theater, or 32 dead at Virginia Tech, or 13 at an immigration center, or the 35 people who are killed with guns in the United States on an average day.

“We should probably begin with another moment of silence,” Barton said.

* * *

That silence was all around them now. It was a Senate that had no more plans to take up gun control, and the members of Congress who refused to meet with them, and the state lawmakers who had been voted out of office for supporting background checks, and President Obama’s apologies that he had already done what he could do, and a general public that sympathized and sent flowers and, yes, even mostly agreed with their positions on gun control but had lost its capacity for outrage nine months and more than 9,000 shooting deaths after Newtown.

In the hours before their rally in Washington, five survivors met near the Capitol to discuss strategies for breaking through the malaise. They had spent the morning in meetings with aides to lawmakers, who offered condolences and water.

“Thoughts and prayers and it ends there,” said Lori Haas, whose daughter was shot and injured at Virginia Tech. “I can’t do anything anymore with thoughts and prayers.”

“I’m learning that you have to be brutal with these people,” said Patricia Maisch, who wrestled away a magazine clip and disarmed the shooter at a 2011 event in Tucson where Gabrielle Giffords and 18 others were shot. Maisch took out a picture she carried of the six people killed at that event and set it on the table. “Now I show this to people and start getting graphic,” she said. “This is not a pretty death like you see on ‘NCIS’ or ‘Law and Order.’ This is six people murdered on the sidewalk on a beautiful Arizona day.”

“Bloody and scared,” said Bill Badger, who was shot in the back of the head that day.

“Oh, and by the way, loved ones aren’t lost. They are killed,” Haas said.

“Murdered,” said Roxanna Green, whose 9-year-old daughter was murdered at the event in Arizona.

“I just want to shake people,” Badger said. “If this was some disease . . . we’d be in a national emergency.”

“You’d see planes dropping medicine,” Maisch said. “Instead, it’s another day. It’s nothing.”

Some of them remembered what it felt like to be oblivious, a part of the audience they were trying so desperately to reach. Barton learned about the 2009 killing spree at an immigration center in Binghamton, N.Y., only three years later, in 2012, after he was shot in Aurora and started to research mass shootings. “Thirteen dead and I didn’t notice,” he said.

Other survivors at the table had remained uninvolved even after their own traumas. It was one thing to be shot in a fluke incident, they said; it was another to be made aware that those flukes were in fact occurring constantly in the United States, where a mass shooting involving four or more people happens about once each day. Green, whose daughter died in Arizona, decided to become an activist only after the shooting in Aurora. Colin Goddard, shot four times during his Intermediate French class at Virginia Tech in 2007, said his “awakening” came years later, while watching coverage of the Binghamton shooting in his New York hotel room.

Now each shooting made Goddard “deflate,” he said, “like going back to square one.” Each new incident made him feel stuck in time: same gun laws, same public inertia, same predictable sense of disbelief, same calls from the same reporters who asked him to reiterate the same story of his own shooting, even though retelling it exhausted him. “You are constantly reliving it, and summoning the outrage, and that’s horrible but also the best chance to make it stop,” he said.

After the shootings at the Navy Yard, Goddard told his story a few dozen more times: that three bullets remain in his shoulder and hip, and that only seven people in his class survived. Haas redoubled her efforts to pressure state lawmakers in Virginia. Tom Mauser, whose son died at Columbine High School in 1999, went to another candlelit vigil wearing his son’s old shoes.

Soto, whose sister was killed in Newtown, received a call Monday from a friend of a friend — a young woman whose mother had just been killed at the Navy Yard. They spoke for an hour. The woman was on her way to identify her mother’s body. Then she was going to a meeting with the FBI. Hundreds of people had visited her house in Washington and dozens more had sent flowers, she told Soto. The woman wanted to know what to expect in the weeks ahead. “What’s it like?” she asked.

“The craziness dies down, and people stop paying attention,” Soto said. “But the feeling goes on forever.”

* * *

The next day at the rally, Soto stood onstage holding a picture of her sister, trying to get some of that attention back. Insects buzzed in the trees above. A motorcade raced along the adjacent street. Soto looked out at about 200 people seated in black folding chairs — a good crowd, she thought, in part because of the recent Navy Yard shooting. “My sister was gunned down,” she began.

During the bus tour, Soto had taken the advice of fellow gun advocates and revised her speech to make it more detailed, and lately she had been telling stories to crowds that she never shared with her family. “We can’t really bring ourselves to talk about it in private,” she said. She knew her speech by heart, but she found it easier to read onstage from an iPad, because it made her memories feel more like remarks.

“We laid my sister’s clothing from that day out on her bed,” she told the audience. “If you have never seen what a bullet hole looks like, your imagination doesn’t do it justice. There were five. One was right by her heart.”

Next to speak was Badger, the 76-year-old retired Army colonel shot at Giffords’s event in Arizona: “There were nine chairs, and this man was just walking down the chairs, shooting them, point-blank,” Badger said. “A congressman. A judge. A 9-year-old.”

Next came Jennifer Longdon, paralyzed in a random shooting in 2004: “My fiance’s most devastating injury was a bullet that roared through his brain,” she said. “Then I was in a room that reeked of blood and antiseptic.”

The speakers rotated onto the stage for about an hour before the president of the local NAACP announced the beginning of the event’s long finale: He would read from a list of names of people killed in gun violence this year. He bowed his head and spoke in staccato rhythm. The audience remained in place — mournful, appalled, activated.

“Michael Arnold, age 16, killed with a gun.

“Sylvia Frasier, age 53, killed with a gun.”

Ten minutes went by, then 20. Some people began checking e-mail on their cellphones. Others left to get lunch. A few dozen more waited until after lunch and then returned to work, leaving behind a sea of empty chairs.

“Michael Cunningham, age 38, killed with a gun.

“Gerald Cunningham, age 27, killed with a gun.”

The remaining survivors at the rally departed for a reception. A man in a business suit walked by and pulled an empty chair into the shade to talk on his cellphone. A school group from Indiana wandered through, sat for a minute and then left.

Soon all that remained was one person at the lectern, reading names that were broadcast through a speaker system. A helicopter flew by. A nearby protester screamed into a megaphone about the federal budget. The speaker leaned into the microphone and raised his voice. “Courtney Davis, age 20, killed with a gun,” he said, but there was nobody left to hear him."

(CNN) —

For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school.

The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults.

As shots rang out, Richie’s teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing.

When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed.

Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises.

Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope

But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy.

“We think it’s good he’s going back,” Wilford said. “If I leave my child anywhere, I’m leaving a piece of my heart, so it’s difficult to leave him.”

’I think I’ll be OK,’ Sandy Hook student says after first day

But Richie apparently isn’t afraid and says he’s looking forward to seeing his friends, she said.

They won’t be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school.

Instead, Richie and his classmates are expected to travel to Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby town of Monroe, where a green-and-white banner greeting the children hangs on a fence.

Survivor’s attorney withdraws lawsuit

Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school.

I think right now it has to be the safest school in America. Monroe Police Lt. Keith White

“(We want) to have as much (of) a normal routine as possible,” she said. “(Thursday) is a regular schedule, and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids.”

The school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at Sandy Hook to help ease the transition for students. Even the school’s pet turtle was relocated, Robinson said.

Security measures have also been increased, with a new system incorporating more cameras and locks, according to Jim Agostine, superintendent of Monroe Public Schools.

“I think right now it has to be the safest school in America,” Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said.

Young'],Chicago marchers urge Obama to come home to address gun violence,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and relatives of victims of fatal shootings in Chicago urged President Barack Obama on Saturday to come back to his hometown and address the gun violence plaguing the city.

Before a march on the city’s South Side, Jackson, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said America’s third most populous city needed more help than Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police superintendent Garry McCarthy could offer.

“When the president shows up, it shows ultimate national seriousness,” said Jackson, a Chicago resident. He also called for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help patrol the streets of Chicago.

Gun violence in Chicago has been in the national spotlight over the past year, with 506 murders in 2012, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. As of Thursday, there were 42 homicides and 157 shootings so far this year, according to Chicago police.

The issue received new urgency with the killing this week of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, an honors student who performed with her high school band at Obama’s inauguration on January 21.

News of her death near Obama’s old home in the Kenwood neighborhood came before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee began hearings on gun control on Wednesday. Obama’s spokesman, Jay Carney, has said the Obamas are praying for Pendleton’s family.

Anita Crittenden, who lost a nephew to gun violence last year, said Obama, by coming to Chicago, would “get the leaders to think and step up and make some changes.”

A petition posted on the White House’s “We the People” website calls for Obama and his family to attend Pendleton’s funeral on February 9. The petition must have at least 100,000 signatures to receive an official response from the White House.

Jackson led nearly 150 people on a march from Martin Luther King Jr. College Prep High School, where Pendleton was a student, to the park where she died a few blocks away.

“My greatest fear about the gun violence in Chicago is that we’re adjusting to it,” he said.

Police said Pendleton was shot to death on Tuesday as she and her friends were shielding themselves from rain under a canopy in the park. Police have called it a case of mistaken identity and are offering a $40,000 award for information leading to her killer.

Emanuel announced plans on Thursday to take 200 police officers now serving in administrative positions and deploy them on the streets.

“Hadiya wanted to make a difference in the world,” said Shatira Wilks, a spokeswoman for the family, and cousin of Cleopatra Cowley, Pendleton’s mother. “It’s unfortunate that it would be like this, but we still hope that this can make a difference.”

Not everyone participating in the march agreed that Obama should come home. Matthew McGill said the president should address the violence issue, but need not single out Chicago, “because what you see in Chicago happens in other cities as well.”"

The man allegedly continued to try to get the woman’s attention after she’d called 911. Police arrived at the scene minutes later, at which point the deceased, former Florida A&M football player Jonathan Ferrell, “immediately charged towards the three officers, one in particular. That officer fired his weapon several times, striking individual multiple times.” Ferrell died at the scene.

And what did police discover right after the ""suspect"" died at the scene?

That he had apparently just been in a ""serious"" car accident.



hortly thereafter, police found what they “believe to be the vehicle that belonged to the individual who was shot. It’s quite possible he was seeking assistance. Based on the accident, it was a pretty serious accident.” Chief Monroe said that Ferrell would have been forced to climb out the back window of his vehicle, and that the property he approached was the nearest house to the scene of the accident.

Police insist this was just an ""unfortunate accident"" however their investigation has found that the shooting of Mr. Ferrell was ""Excessive"" and the officer involved

Ok, suppose you're in Ferrell's situation. You've just crashed your car - apparently had to crawl out of it through you back window. You're disoriented. Perhaps concussed. Probably Confused. You stagger to the very nearest house and try to get someone's attention, someone who can perhaps help you - maybe someone to call for help.

And they do call for help, but not to help You.

So then when the help arrives and you go rushing toward them, in desperation, perhaps not exactly in your right state of mind, not exactly a wise strategic more - but then again you're frantic.

The first immediate response is....

BANG!!

Ok, now play that scenario again in your head and this time - make the very recent accident victim who gets shot dead while seeking assistance - not a young Black former Florida A&M Football player barreling down on an apparently nervous, edgy and trigger-happy COP.

Just imagine it. Just imagine if you were that desperate, confused accident victim? Blurry vision. Head ache. Ears ringing. Vertigo. You Need H.E.L.P.!

Is this the kind of treatment you would expect?

Can you see all of that still happening? Is that something you might expect as even conceivable? Doors closed in your face. Windows locked. PANIC Alarms and Police Called in Fear of you? Ferrell had no weapon, just himself, but when Police arrive there was No warning? ""Stay Back. FREEZE. Halt or we'll Shoot!"" No taser? (Maybe a Taser, but it didn't work? Not clear yet) No club? No kettling? No Pepper-spray? No nothing - just BANG?

Yeah, I can't see it either.

It's seems almost as though his very existence was threat enough, and that had to be ended. Period.

But as I said before it - probably - has nothing to do with race. Yes, of course not. Although you can find 20 More Cases of Unarmed Black Men being Killed by Law Enforcement Here (and the list doesn't include Trayvon Martin) and you can find a recent study estimating that nearly 150 Unarmed Black Men were shot down by police and/or vigilantes in 2012 HERE.

But Yeah. we can all be rest assured that since the police said so - Race didn't have a thing to do with it. Nope, not a thing.

Vyan

P.S. Just to back up the ""Aint' Racism"" view - the Charlotte Police Chief is Black (although for the record the officer who fired the fatal shots is not)

More from Huffpo: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...











Ok, I've looked over all the comments and this is what I think.

The entire problem with this story is presumption. The woman in the house, using incomplete information, made a presumption. That isn't to say the aftermath and results are her fault - per se - only that her's was the first in a series of wrong presumptions. Whether she had a duty or responsibility to find out who was at the door before opening it, or once discovering it wasn't who she thought it was asking why he was there is debatable - however both hitting her Panic Alarm and calling 9-1-1 to report an attempted burglar was sending the police into a situation with wrong information. (If a former Florida A&M Football player wants to get into your house, he'd be IN YOUR HOUSE not knocking at the door) Her's was the snowball at the top of the hill, and the police made it an avalanche. It might have gone differently without her claims, or it might not - that isn't clear. Certainly they had a duty to determine the facts, but there is also something called ""Officer Safety"" which dictates their own self-defense parameters and responses when they've been told that their dealing with a potential criminal.

They all made a wrong presumption and consequently Farrell lost his life. Exactly why isn't clear. Was Farrell unable to communicate? Did they fail to listen? Were they unwilling to listen? It's fair to say their original presumption of his criminality wasn't illogical or completely unfounded, and neither would be the presumption that their failure to recognize the truth was founded in their own biases and possible bigotry - but it would be just as wrong to cling to the presumption of bigotry despite the facts as it was for them to cling to their original ""criminal"" presumption despite the facts.

That's where I started with this diary in the first place. That's why I started without the presumption that this was yet another case of bigotry gone wild. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. The problem is letting presumption and fear, even ""reasonable and logical"" fear, overrule the truth. The only solution for that is to have the courage to find the truth, even if doing so sometimes just might put you or the people around you at potential risk. No, the law doesn't require people to do that, but sometimes decency does, because without that courage and yes, RISK to find the Facts, tragedies like this happen, and they will continue to happen..

If only one person in this situation had been willing to take that risk to find out what was going on with Ferrell - to try and communicate with him and listen first - which, yes, would have meant putting finding out what was going on possibly ahead of their own immediate personal safety, the outcome here could have been different. No one is required to that, but IMO this is exactly what can and does happen when they don't.

Having that courage is what it's going to take to change things. It's the only thing IMO that works.

Williamson responded to Gabby Gifford's New York Times op-ed by churlishly calling her out as an embarrassment.



While Ms. Giffords certainly has my sympathy for the violence she suffered, it should be noted that being shot in the head by a lunatic does not give one any special grace to pronounce upon public-policy questions, nor does it give one moral license to call people “cowards” for holding public-policy views at variance with one’s own. Her childish display in the New York Times is an embarrassment.

I'll tell you what is an embarrassment, Mr. Williamson. It is a Senate who voted against the will of 90 percent of this nation and instead caved to the craven demands of the National Rifle Association. What is embarrassing is having people like you defend this action and take it upon yourself to decide that a shooting victim who was a member of the United States Congress has no moral license to speak out on behalf of the overwhelming majority of this country who stand in agreement with her. What is cringe-inducing is to have people who carry your same sentiments tell the parents of the children killed in the Newtown massacre that they should have no voice in the debate and declare they are merely being used as props.

Given the nation's focus right now on the drama unfolding in Boston, I expect your vile slam against Gabby Giffords will go largely unnoticed, Mr Williamson. However, I noticed and am compelled to share your shameful attack on her.

In the meantime, I stand with Ms. Giffords and will join her in her efforts to fire the members of Congress who chose to pander to the will of the NRA rather than the people they were sent to represent.

But the trip ended in tragedy when the 15-year-old King College Prep sophomore was fatally shot about a week after she attended President Barack Obama’s inauguration and performed at inaugural events with the King College Prep band and drill team.

Penldeton and a16-year-old boy wounded in the attack were shot in a park near the school about 2:20 p.m., in the 4500 block of South Oakenwald Avenue, police said.

Most of those who were in the park were gang members, and those in the group did not stay on scene to help after the shootings, according to police. The shooting occurred around 2:20 p.m. in the 4500 block of South Oakenwald Avenue.

They boy remained in serious condition Tuesday night. He was also a student at King, according to Pendleton’s friends, though her relatives weren’t sure what school the boy attended.

One of the teens was taken in serious to critical condition to Comer Children's Hospital, according to Chicago Fire Department spokesman Will Knight.

The other victim also was taken to Comer and police at first believed both victims' conditions had stabilized by a little after 3 p.m., said Chicago Police News Affairs Officer Veejay Zala.

At Comer this evening, a group of young people sat and stood inside the entrance to the hospital's emergency room, along with the principal of King high school.

Many hugged as they brushed tears from their eyes and consoled each other and Pendleton's parents.

""She was awesome,"" one girl said of Pendleton outside the hospital's ER.

Friends of the slain girl said King was dismissed early today because of exams, and students went to the park on Oakenwald--something they don't usually do.

Friends said the girl was a majorette and a volleyball player, a friendly and sweet presence at King, one of the top 10 CPS selective enrollment schools. Pendleton performed with other King College students at President Barack Obama’s inaugural events.

Neighbors said students from King do hang out at Harsh Park, 4458-70 S. Oakenwald Ave., and that students were there this afternoon before the shooting took place. A group of 10 to 12 teens at the park had taken shelter under a canopy there during a rainstorm when a boy or man jumped a fence in the park, ran toward the group and opened fire, police said in a statement this evening.

The attacker then got into an auto and left the area, police said.

Neighbors reported hearing shots about 2:20 p.m.

Desiree Sanders said she heard six gunshots and called 911 after a neighbor told her that some teens had been shot. Neighbors told her as many as 10 young people had been hanging out at the small park, and most scattered after the shooting, though a few stayed behind with the victims.

Those in the group were not cooperating with police, however, and investigators had no detailed descriptions yet of either the attacker or the vehicle in which he left. Central Area detectives were investigating, and they had no one in custody as of about 8:20 p.m.

Police crime data show no serious crimes happened in the 4400 or 4500 blocks of South Oakenwald Avenue Dec. 19 to Jan. 20.

“It’s a great neighborhood. Nothing like this has happened since I’ve been here,” on the block, said Roxanne Hubbard, who has lived in the neighborhood for 19 years.

As a matter of policy, Chicago Board of Education officials refuse to confirm whether any child is a student at Chicago Public Schools because a policy on student identification passed by the board several years ago has never been implemented.

Shooting in a Tucson parking lot was two years ago today.

We must seek common-sense solutions so such horrors don't happen again.

The children of Sandy Hook deserve our efforts to stop gun violence.

In response to a horrific series of shootings that has sown terror in our communities, victimized tens of thousands of Americans, and left one of its own bleeding and near death in a Tucson parking lot, Congress has done something quite extraordinary — nothing at all.

I was shot in the head while meeting with constituents two years ago today. Since then, my extensive rehabilitation has brought excitement and gratitude to our family. But time and time again, our joy has been diminished by new, all too familiar images of death on television: the breaking news alert, stunned witnesses blinking away tears over unspeakable carnage, another community in mourning. America has seen an astounding 11 mass shootings since a madman used a semiautomatic pistol with an extended ammunition clip to shoot me and kill six others. Gun violence kills more than 30,000 Americans annually.

This country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems, big and small. Wise policy has conquered disease, protected us from dangerous products and substances, and made transportation safer. But when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence, we're not even trying — and for the worst of reasons.

An ideological fringe

Special interests purporting to represent gun owners but really advancing the interests of an ideological fringe have used big money and influence to cow Congress into submission. Rather than working to find the balance between our rights and the regulation of a dangerous product, these groups have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties. Rather than conducting a dialogue, they threaten those who divert from their orthodoxy with political extinction.

As a result, we are more vulnerable to gun violence. Weapons designed for the battlefield have a home in our streets. Criminals and the mentally ill can easily purchase guns by avoiding background checks. Firearm accessories designed for killing at a high rate are legal and widely available. And gun owners are less responsible for the misuse of their weapons than they are for their automobiles.

Forget the boogeyman of big, bad government coming to dispossess you of your firearms. As a Western woman and a Persian Gulf War combat veteran who have exercised our Second Amendment rights, we don't want to take away your guns any more than we want to give up the two guns we have locked in a safe at home. What we do want is what the majority of NRA members and other Americans want: responsible changes in our laws to require responsible gun ownership and reduce gun violence.

We saw from the NRA leadership's defiant and unsympathetic response to the Newtown, Conn., massacre that winning even the most common-sense reforms will require a fight. But whether it has been in campaigns or in Congress, in combat or in space, fighting for what we believe in has always been what we do.

Let's not be naive

We can't be naive about what it will take to achieve the most common-sense solutions. We can't just hope that the last shooting tragedy will prevent the next. Achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources.

Americans for Responsible Solutions, which we are launching today, will invite people from around the country to join a national conversation about gun violence prevention, will raise the funds necessary to balance the influence of the gun lobby, and will line up squarely behind leaders who will stand up for what's right.

Until now, the gun lobby's political contributions, advertising and lobbying have dwarfed spending from anti-gun violence groups. No longer. With Americans for Responsible Solutions engaging millions of people about ways to reduce gun violence and funding political activity nationwide, legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby. Other efforts such as improving mental health care and opposing illegal guns are essential, but as gun owners and survivors of gun violence, we have a unique message for Americans.

We have experienced too much death and hurt to remain idle. Our response to the Newtown massacre must consist of more than regret, sorrow and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve fellow citizens and leaders who have the will to prevent gun violence in the future.

The Army Times, citing the Temple Daily Telegram, reports an attorney for U.S. Army Master Sgt. Christopher Grisham has filed a notice of his intent to appeal in a case that has attracted the interest of gun advocates nationwide.

The attorney, Blue Rannefeld, reportedly asserted in the motion that the prosecution's claims were not supported by the evidence.

KWTX-TV News reports jurors convicted Grisham – a soldier stationed at Ford Hood in Texas – on Nov. 20 of the class-B crime, which carries a fine not to exceed $2,000 and a jail sentence of not more than 180 days.

Grisham was arrested while hiking with his 15-year-old son, who was working on the requirements for a Boy Scout badge.

Grisham was carrying an AR-15 rifle and a concealed handgun, for which he had a permit. Texas law allows for rifles to be carried in public.

Someone reportedly called police expressing alarm over a man carrying a rifle along a road. Officer Steve Ermis responded and, according to court testimony, was initially concerned because he didn't know Grisham's intentions.

Rannefeld argued at trial that Grisham was carrying the rifle to protect against aggressive wild hogs. He reportedly said Ermis ""went above and beyond to control and intimidate,"" when he stopped the two.

Texas lawmakers approve gun-friendly bills

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas House approved a batch of bills Saturday to further soften gun laws that were already among the country's most firearms-friendly, allowing college students to carry handguns in class, putting potentially armed marshals in public schools and exempting the state from any future federal bans on assault rifles, high-capacity magazines or universal background checks.

Dubbed ""gun day"" by supporters and opponents alike, the parade of votes came as tens of thousands of members of the National Rifle Association attended the group's annual convention in Houston. Gov. Rick Perry welcomed convention attendees Friday with a video of him taking target practice using a semi-automatic rifle.

The 12 approved gun bills must all clear final, procedural votes before heading to the state Senate. Still, they advanced with only minimal delay, cruising past Democrat-led efforts to block or stall them. Nearly all were approved by simple voice votes.

A Democratic parliamentary point of order managed to shoot down just one, a bill by Rep. Van Taylor, R-Plano, that would have allowed the use of a concealed handgun license as valid proof of personal identification — even though obtaining such licenses requires a background check that's not necessary to get driver licenses and many other forms of ID.

The fiercest debate in the Republican-controlled chamber came over the plan to allow students over 21 who already hold concealed weapons permits to take their handguns into college classrooms. The issue became exceedingly volatile during the last legislative session in 2011, and ultimately failed.

Pro-Second Amendment lawmakers have revived it, however. Sponsor Rep. Allen Fletcher, R-Tomball, reminded lawmakers: ""College campuses are not crime-free zones.""

The measure would allow colleges and universities to opt out of the new rules annually — which has softened opposition to it among some top higher education leaders. Current law already allows universities to opt in, and the Texas A&M University System is among those that have done so.

Meanwhile, the Texas Senate has already approved a separate measure allowing college students to keep guns in their cars on campus. But the prospects for the campus carry bill passed by the House on Saturday appear far bleaker. Top Republicans have even suggested the issue will be a non-starter in the upper chamber.

The House also overwhelmingly approved a bill that attracted national attention when it was introduced by first-term, tea party Republican Rep. Steve Toth of The Woodlands. It would nullify within state borders any federal laws banning assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, or expansion of background checks for firearms owners, even though doing so would almost certainly violate the U.S. Constitution.

""There are 27 amendments in the Constitution but only one says 'shall not be infringed,'"" Toth said. ""The Second Amendment is the amendment that keeps the people free.""

Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, raised a string of parliamentary objections to many of the gun bills, but they all failed. He asked Toth, ""Is your bill political posturing?""

""We just passed by voice vote a slew of pro-gun legislation,"" Walle said. ""So what is this? Why do we need it?""

Rep. Gene Wu, a Houston Democrat, went further on Twitter, saying, ""In case your head is too thick to understand: State law will not trump federal law.""

Conroe Republican Rep. Brandon Creighton, and several co-authors, sponsored a bill to punish by up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine police officers or government officials who try to enforce federal firearms limits in Texas.

Also passing was the school marshal measure, sponsored by Dallas Republican Rep. Jason Villalba. The marshals would be employees who already hold concealed weapons permits and are chosen by their public school district or charter schools to receive firearms training. They would keep guns locked away on campus, but have access to them in an emergency — though their identities would not be divulged to the public.

Causing fewer fireworks when it passed was a measure reducing penalties for permit holders who accidentally show a concealed handgun.

Three other successful bills reduced the number of hours of training needed to obtain a concealed handgun license and tweaked the rules for renewing or being fingerprinted for one. A separate measure that passed 136-0 reduced the concealed handgun license fee for police officers, military veterans, national and state Guard members and even some Criminal Justice Department employees, despite costing the state up to $2 million in lost revenues.

Another measure that was approved was one by Democratic Rep. Ryan Guillen of Rio Grande City that's meant to prohibit agencies from posting ""no carry"" signs in cases where carrying a gun isn't illegal and imposing fines for violators. A bill by fellow Democrat Sergio Munoz of Palmview to expand school districts' ability to alert hunters of the location of campuses also passed."

So here are 2 very current stories here about 2 raving wingnuts who had LOTS of guns and weren't supposed to, posting hit lists on facebook or whatever, STILL openly threatening to kill people.

Guy #1 is the sort I have been warning you about:

Police in Clarkstown, New York have confiscated a cache of high-powered weapons and body armor from a man who was arrested for posting death threats against against many Democratic politicians and every liberal supporter of President Barack Obama.

Mulqueen’s landlady had tipped off police after she found a “hit list” posted on Facebook that threatened Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY) and all members of the Congressional Black Caucus. *** Nyack-Piermont Patch reported that police searched Mulqueen’s home and found two high-powered rifles, two bayonets, a sword, a knuckle knife, body armor and ammunition. Included in the 100 rounds of ammunition were 27 so-called “tank buster” .50 caliber armor-piercing shells. Previous criminal convictions meant that it was illegal for Mulqueen to possess the weapons.

What did cops do to find this guy? They listened to his landlady when she complained after reading his facebook page.So this guy was not supposed to have guns of any sort to begin with and yet he has the audacity to post a hit list and threaten people.

The mind reels.

We'll never know if a tragedy was prevented or not: I see little harm in imagining this to be the case."
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-31/news/chi-illinois-senate-debating-new-concealed-carry-gun-bill-20130531_1_gun-bill-state-lawmakers-gun-control-proponents,2013-05-31 00:00:00,"['Ray Long', 'Monique Garcia']",Illinois lawmakers approve concealed carry gun bill,"SPRINGFIELD --- State lawmakers today approved compromise legislation to set up rules on who can carry concealed guns and where they can be carried.

Illinois is the last state in the nation not to have some form of concealed carry on the books, but a federal appeals court overturned the state’s long standing ban in December and gave lawmakers until June 9 to come up with regulations to allow it.

""Don't let your constituents go off the cliff, this is a historic day for law abiding gun owners in this state,"" said sponsoring Rep. Brandon Phelps, D-Harrisburg.

Under the proposal, concealed weapons would be banned from numerous sites, such as CTA and Metra buses and trains, casinos, government buildings and stadiums. But lawmakers said the bill would allow people to carry concealed weapons in restaurants where alcohol is served but more than half of the sales are for food.

A five-year concealed weapons permit would be issued to applicants. Law enforcement could object, and an applicant could appeal to a seven-member board designed to have people with such credentials as former judges or FBI agents. A person would have to complete 16 hours of training before getting a gun.

A series of provisions were designed to prevent people with mental health problems from getting guns. ""We don't want to mentally ill people to have firearms, period,"" said Phelps, the House's main gun rights supporter and a major negotiator.

Attempts were made to allow gun owners to carry through different communities without getting hung up on a patchwork of local laws.

Chicago's ban on assault weapons would be kept intact, but towns that don’t already have a ban would be prevented from adopting them.

The Senate quickly passed the bill 45-12-1. The House vote was 89-28.

The bill needed three-fifths votes in both chambers because it would affect home-rule cities like Chicago.

""We worked really hard on this bill to come up with something that we think everybody can live with, but probably everybody won't be happy with,"" said sponsoring Sen. Gary Forby, D-Benton. ""But it's something we need to do.""

“We’re not there yet on this bill, not even close,” said Sen. Dan Kotowski, D-Park Ridge, who said the 16-hours of training required in the bill was not enough.

Gov. Pat Quinn's spokeswoman offered the administration's standard response when asked about the bill, saying Quinn would review it when it reaches his desk.

Democrats and Republicans got up to speak in favor in the Senate.

“This bill is for the common good of all citizens, those who live in our dense cities, those who live in our rural areas, it’s time to put this issue to rest,” said Sen. William Haine, D-Alton.

“We all know but for the Constitution and the federal court, we might not be here today,” said Sen. Bill Brady, R-Bloomington. “I think what’s most important is like 49 other states in the nation, the citizens of Illinois will enjoy a right and will become comfortable with because we crafted a good law, at least as a start.”

State lawmakers have wrestled over how to bridge the state's regional and philosophical divide between gun rights advocates and gun control proponents. In the latest version, both sides budget, and lawmakers indicated the city of Chicago and the National Rifle Association both registeried as neutral. But Chicago's anti-gun lawmakers still contended the bill was not strong enough even as other lawmakers wanted fewer restrictions.

""We got a bill everybody can live with,"" said Forby, the sponsor from Downstate Benton who has long fought for gun rights.

""Everybody agreed nobody liked"" the bill, Forby said, ""But it was something we had to do by July 9. ... Nobody wanted to go over the cliff.""

Attempts were made to allow gun owners to carry through different communities without getting hung up on a patchwork of local laws.

But Forby got peppered by lawmakers who worried that the legislation opened up the potential to allowing a person with a firearm owners identification card to have as many as 100 guns in his car trunk without violating laws.

Forby said he saw nothing illegal, prompting some lawmakers to shake their heads in disappointment.

Democratic Sen. Tony Munoz, a Chicago policeman, also questioned why the legislation would allow people to carry concealed weapons in places where more than half of the sales are for food.

Forby said a restaurant or bar owner also can put up a sign that says no guns are allowed, but Sen. Ira Silverstein, D-Chicago, said the option is ""ludicrous"" because it would be hard to know who was complying with the sign unless there were a metal detector at the door.

Forby parried that somebody always will break the law ""no matter what you do.""

Democratic Sen. Kim Lightford of Maywood contended the bill fails to give ""enough protections in violent situations.""

The elements of the bill came together in a meeting Thursday with Speaker Michael Madigan, who had pushed through a separate proposal.

Shear']",Obama Unveils Proposals for Toughening Laws on Guns,"The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage. The White House created a Web page with video testimonials from victims of gun violence and a sign-up for supporters to help advocate the president’s plan.

“I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,” Mr. Obama said. “And, by the way, that doesn’t just mean from certain parts of the country. We’re going to need voices in those areas, in those Congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong, to speak up and to say this is important. It can’t just be the usual suspects.”

The N.R.A. made clear that it was ready for a fight. Even before the president’s speech, it broadcast a provocative video calling Mr. Obama an “elitist hypocrite” for opposing more armed guards in schools while his daughters had Secret Service protection. After the speech the group said it would work to secure schools, fix the mental health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president’s other proposals. “Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,” the N.R.A. said in a statement. “Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected, and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.”

Mr. Obama’s plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing laws, improve the nation’s database used for background checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental illness to get guns.

Mr. Obama asked Congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. He also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds, like those used in Newtown and other mass shootings. Mr. Obama’s plan would require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales. Nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/11/colorado-dems-face-historic-recall-over-gun-votes/,2013-09-11 00:00:00,['Joseph Weber'],Colorado state senators recalled over gun control support,"Two Democratic lawmakers in Colorado, including the president of the state Senate, were recalled Tuesday in elections brought about by their support for tougher gun control laws.

According to unofficial results, voters in Colorado Springs favored recalling state Sen. John Morse, the body's president, by 51 percent to 49 percent. With 100 percent of precincts reporting, state Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo was defeated in her recall election, 56 percent to 44 percent.

The Colorado Republican Party called the vote results ""a loud and clear message to out-of-touch Democrats across the nation"" in a statement released late Tuesday. Colorado's Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, said he was ""disappointed by the outcome of the recall elections"" before calling on state residents to ""refocus again on what unites Coloradans -- creating jobs, educating our children, creating a healthier state -- and on finding ways to keep Colorado moving forward.""

""We as the Democratic Party will continue to fight,"" Morse told supporters in Colorado Springs as he conceded the race. Republican Bernie Herpin, a former Colorado Springs city councilman, will replace him. Giron will be replaced by Republican George Rivera, a former deputy police chief in Pueblo.

""We will win in the end because we are on the right side,"" Giron said in her concession speech.

The votes marked the first time in Colorado history that a state lawmaker faced a recall effort and the biggest backlash in states that passed tougher gun-control laws following two mass shootings last year – at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater and a Newtown, Conn., elementary school.

Democratic-leaning Connecticut, Maryland, and New York also passed tougher gun laws without a recall effort making a state ballot.

The states’ effort came after President Obama’s unsuccessful attempt to get Congress to pass stricter federal laws – including tighter background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.

In Colorado Springs, the majority of registered voters are Democrats, but many are conservative-leaning. 23 percent of them, in fact, signed the petition to recall Morse, according to The Denver Post.

The National Rifle Association and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lined up on opposite sides of the recall effort, led by gun-rights advocates upset over the legislation and how the hearings were conducted.

Both state legislators voted for 15-round limits on ammunition magazines and for expanded background checks on private gun sales.

The legislation passed Colorado's Democrat-led legislature without any Republican support and was signed into law by Hickenlooper, who had initially rejected calls for stronger gun control laws.

Morse, a former police chief in suburban Colorado Springs, said Colorado's gun laws were commonsense ideas to reduce fatalities in mass shootings. He was first elected to the Colorado Senate in 2006.

Reported contributions to Morse and Giron totaled about $3 million, dwarfing the reported amount raised by gun activists who petitioned for the recall, though some independent groups didn't have to report spending. Both the NRA and Bloomberg contributed more than $300,000 to the pro- and anti-recall campaigns.

In addition, dozens of elected county sheriffs have sued to block the gun laws.

One of the Morse recall organizers, Timothy Knight, said supporters are upset that lawmakers limited debate on the gun legislation and seemed more inclined to take cues from the White House than their constituents.

""If the people had been listened to, these recalls wouldn't be happening,"" Knight said.

As elsewhere across America, that figure doesn't fully measure the misery of the state's economic situation.

But as of this weekend, the situation is going to get a lot worse for about 70,000 out-of-work residents. Having bought into the cries for austerity, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and the legislature made it a priority to slash unemployment compensation in February. As a result, North Carolina will be the first to lose a lifeline for the long-term unemployed—the Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program.

That 100 percent federally funded program was enacted because of the Great Recession. It extended the period of time jobless Americans could collect compensation checks to as much as 99 weeks in the worst-hit states. Nationwide, 1.7 million Americans still receive compensation under the EUC. Unless Congress acts, which seems highly unlikely, the entire program expires Dec. 31 this year. But North Carolina is bailing six months early.

The reason North Carolinians will no longer be covered under the federal program is because the legislature cut maximum compensation of the state unemployment program to $350 a week. Under the provisions of the EUC, no such cuts are allowed without a federal waiver, which North Carolina did not obtain.

The stated rationale behind the cuts? North Carolina owes the federal government $2.1 billion it borrowed to cover payments when it ran out of money in the state compensation fund because of the severity of the recession. The goal is to pay off that debt by 2015. Nineteen other states also borrowed money from the feds to cover holes in their compensation funds.

Altogether, between now and 2017, the North Carolina legislature's fiscal research office says, the state will save $3.6 billion from compensation cuts and an additional charge to businesses of $42 a year for each employee. Of the total, 74 percent of the savings will come from cuts in worker compensation.

Not only did the legislature whack how much an eligible jobless person can collect each week—the average is $292.60—it also cut how long a person can collect payments to 20 weeks from the 26 weeks every state has provided compensation for the past half-century. If the unemployment rate falls far enough in North Carolina, the maximum compensation period will be reduced to just 12 weeks, the lowest in the nation.

The package of cuts was originally the work of the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the state's main business lobby.

Vote to proceed with gun-control package carries 68 to 31 with bipartisan support

Democrats needed 60 votes to break threatened filibuster

National Rifle Association closely watched procedural vote to %22score%22 senators

Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that while the National Rifle Association has said it may ""score"" senators on votes during the current gun debate, it did not specify that Thursday's cloture vote would be scored.

WASHINGTON — The Senate voted 68 to 31 Thursday morning to move forward on a gun safety bill, breaking a threatened filibuster from conservative Republicans who wanted to draw out debate on a measure that they say threatens their Second Amendment rights.

The vote was just the first step in what could be a weeks-long saga fraught with procedural perils and subject to a barrage of amendments from both sides.

But it ensures an open debate on gun control for the first time in nearly a decade, and four months after 26 children and adults were shot and killed by a gunman bearing a semi-automatic rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

""We've got the attention of the American people, and frankly, the world,"" Majority Leader Harry Reid said after the vote, as families of Sandy Hook victims watched, hands over mouths, from a gallery.

The vote -- on ""cloture,"" or closing debate and allowing a bill to come to the floor — was one of the most-watched procedural votes in recent history. The National Rifle Association said it would take senators' votes on the gun legislation into account in sending out pre-election letter grades.

It also broke some party and regional lines. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., voted to move forward with the bill despite his ""A+"" rating from the NRA. Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, and Mark Pryor, D-Ark., voted against.

The 16 Republican senators voting to move forward were Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Dean Heller of Nevada, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Mark Kirk of Illinois, John McCain of Arizona, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

A trio of conservative GOP senators — Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas — said they forced the filibuster-breaking ""cloture"" vote because the legislation was unfinished, and no one has seen the final language of a key amendment.

""We believe the abuse of the process is how the rights of Americans are systematically eroded and we will continue to do everything in our power to prevent it,"" they said in a joint statement sent out just before the vote.

Even with the 60 votes necessary to proceed on the gun bill, Senate rules require 30 hours of debate. That time is often routinely waived — but a single senator can insist on allowing the full time for arguments. Reid said Thursday morning that senators from both sides are ""waiting in the wings"" to offer amendments.

First up: a proposal from Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would expand background checks to guns shows and Internet sales, but exclude many of the person-to-person transfers that President Obama wanted to be covered. That amendment will come up for debate Tuesday, Reid said. After that will come Democratic-sponsored amendments to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and then an alternating series of Republican and Democratic amendments on mental health, school safety, straw purchases and others.

But the language of those amendments still hasn't been introduced.

As senators headed to the chamber to vote, the Obama administration formally came out in support of the underlying bill, ushered through the Senate Judiciary Committee by Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., that would expand background checks but would not create new limits on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.

""The administration urges the Congress to make the legislation even stronger by adding provisions to keep weapons of war and high-capacity ammunition magazines that facilitate mass killings off the nation's streets,"" said the statement released through the Office of Management and Budget.

Vice President Biden, in an interview that aired Thursday on MSNBC, pointed to public opinion polls to show Americans favoring legislation such as expanded background checks for gun purchasers.

""This is one of the cases where the public is so far ahead of the elected officials — I mean so far ahead,"" Biden said on the Morning Joe program. ""You saw it in immigration, you saw it in marriage issues, you're seeing it now. The public has moved to a different place."""

Both the Joyce Foundation and Google are established players in the anti-second amendment movement as well as other progressive political causes.

The Joyce Foundation has injected large chucks of money into the anti-gun movement, including Mayor’s Against Gun Control and the Violence Prevention Center. (Aside: Who was on the Board of the Joyce Foundation? None other than President Barack Obama who keeps assuring us that he doesn’t want to take our guns away. Obama sat on the board of the Joyce Foundation from 1994-2002.)

Likewise, Google’s support for anti-gun “advocacy” is no secret.

Specifically, they’ve banned results related to firearms and other products that they don’t deem to be “family safe.” Until recently, gun-related products appeared with other products in search results on the shopping section. Many of America’s 80 million gun owners have used Google as a powerful price-comparison tool. Not anymore.

And the connections go further, Ben Howe writes:

We know that Obama campaign manager Jim Messina received personal mentoring on both technology approaches and management style from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, his friend since the 2008 campaign. We know that Google employees overwhelmingly contributed to Democrats in the last cycle (and aggregate individual employee contributions outnumbered the company’s PAC contributions). We know that Google vice president and “chief Internet evangelist” Vint Cerf received a presidential appointment to the National Science Board following last year’s election.

The left wing Joyce Foundation just funded a digital advocacy study co-authored by Organizing for Action’s (formerly Obama for America) Michael Slaby, who used to work for Google’s Eric Schmidt.

As we continue hear wailing and lamenting about “big money” in politics and the need for campaign finance reform, let’s keep in mind the left is as big a benefactor if not bigger of “big money” as the right."

The suit in which Smith is taking part specifically targets the laws that emerged from HB 1224 and HB 1229.

HB 1224 bans rifle and pistol magazines holding more than 15 rounds that “were acquired after July 1, 2013.” At the same time, it also bans many other magazines by prohibiting smaller magazines “designed to be readily converted.”

When Breitbart News spoke to Sheriff Smith on July 22, he explained:

The problem with this is that those who wrote the law don’t understand firearms or magazines. And many of the most popular firearms have magazines with removal floorplates — for instance, a Glock magazine. This law will effectively ban certain magazines even if they’re under the capacity limit, based solely on the fact that they are expandable or simply give the appearance of expandability.

HB 1229 put background checks in place for every sale in the state–in store sales, online sales, private sales, and of course, sales at gun shows. Additionally, after forcing every sale to go through a Federal Firearms License (FFL), this law also adds a $10 fee for every background check.

Smith explained to Breitbart News that another asinine aspect of HB 1229 is that it incorporates a 72 hour rule; the law is written so that any time your gun is out of your possession for more than 72 hours you will have to do a background check before getting it back (which also means you will have to pay a $10 fee).

They’ve written the law in a way that the difference between legality and illegality are undefined. They simply stress that the gun has to be in your possession at all times. They’ve tried to clarify this to mean under or within your domain. But let’s say you’re a Colorado resident in legal possession of gun you owned prior the the July 1, 2013 deadline. You have an automobile accident and while the ambulance takes you to the hospital, police find the gun in your vehicle. They hold the gun for you but you’re in the hospital longer than 72 hours. When you finally recover and leave the hospital you ask the police for your gun and they say you have to do a background check to get your own gun back because it’s been longer than 72 hours. Moreover, you have a 17 round magazine in that gun and those are now banned, and because it was out of your possession for longer than 72 hours you’ve forfeited it. This is a mess.

The suit filed by Smith and his fellow Sheriffs is joined by numerous Colorado businesses and individual Colorado citizens. Said Smith: “We are a cantankerous bunch and this is our Alamo.”

Where exactly will the lines be drawn in determining who is too mentally ill to own a gun? Is it only those who have been forcibly committed, or do we go for even those suffering from slight depression? That would likely include more than half of America. If something as simple as this or a brief hospitalization can revoke someone's right to have a weapon, that will, in the long run, prevent many with problems from seeking help for fear of losing their rights.

Some in Congress want to pass more gun-control laws on law abiding citizens.

I've given this some thought: The person who shot those individuals in Newtown, Conn., stole the gun he used, which is against the law. He shot and killed his mother, also against the law.

He transported the loaded gun onto school property, against the law. He broke into the school and discharged the weapon within city limits, killing 26 people, against the law.

Yet there are people in this country who think passing another law would protect us. The only people that a gun-ban law would impact are law-abiding citizens.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is also a mental illness. Should we disarm servicemembers? Gauging what ""mental illness"" prevents someone from getting a gun is complex.

We need to dedicate ourselves to finding the best solution, regardless of personal biases. We can't keep depending on tragedies to remind us that gun control is a problem we haven't come close to solving.

Jayson Flores

Letter to the Editor:

The recent USA TODAY editorial about gun control promulgates the idea that the main ingredient in the tragedies caused by people using military-style weapons is the mental state of the perpetrator.

I have experience with weapons similar to those used in many of the recent killings. These weapons might be fun to use, and I suppose I could bag a deer with them, but they were designed for one purpose — to kill people. Arguments against gun control boil down to one thing: the attitude that as long as there is no skin off my back, I don't care. If we can blame these senseless killings on the mentally unstable, then we don't have to think about controlling the guns. To all owners of assault weapons: If it would save one life, would you give up your gun and 30-round clip?

The measure, approved by the Ohio House and sent to the Senate, would eliminate the traditional requirement that a person prudently retreat in the face of danger before resorting to deadly force. It would make Ohio the latest of more than a score of other states following the foolhardy lead of Florida — where the first Stand Your Ground law has proved to be rife with risks to public safety and effective law enforcement.

Statehouse opponents pointed to the notorious gunshot slaying of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager, in Florida last year as a clear warning of what could be in store for Ohio. But there is a dangerous disconnect between statehouse politicians’ allegiance to the gun lobby and the mortal reality in the most gun-threatened neighborhoods. “We’re talking about human life,” said Representative Alicia Reece, Democrat of Cincinnati. “We have to get it right.”

A recent report in The Times by John Eligon underscored the checkerboard pattern of gun deaths in the nation, where one city’s fatality average can be improving even as its poorest and toughest neighborhoods suffer a spike in gunshot violence. “There’s a sense of hopelessness on behalf of a lot of people,” said a resident who sleeps with a shotgun in a part of North St. Louis where there were 17 murders last year, up from five in 2009, while citywide homicides dropped nearly 60 percent.

This imbalance, which has grave consequences in the most hard-pressed black communities, is rarely acknowledged in the national gun debate. Statehouses too often are working to increase the numbers of armed civilians and their freedoms, as in Ohio, where professional police organizations strongly oppose Stand Your Ground."

United States and Russia Agree on Framework for Securing Syria’s Chemical Weapons, Kerry Says

The press seems a little bemused that they have to take Kerry seriously now, after their treatment of him in 2004.

Timothy Egan:

The net result, accidental or not, is that Syria is no longer just an American problem. They say they will give up the poison gas that, wink, wink, was never used. The principle, as Obama said, “that with modest effort and risk we stop children from being gassed to death,” is there on the table for a world that preferred to look the other way. And, added bonus: the neocon warriors are gone, homeless in both parties. All of this is a hugely positive leap from where we were a week, a month, or a year ago. But outcomes don’t really matter to those obsessed by who won and who lost, those who see all politics as up-and-down nonsense instead of a clash of ideas with real consequences. So this past week has to be cast in the tired terms of the daily struggle for sound-bite supremacy. It’s a debacle. A blunder. A humiliation. “This rudderless diplomacy,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican Party, “has embarrassed America on the world stage.” You want embarrassment? Just consider some of the public statements of Republicans in the last two weeks.

I talked about the death of neocon ideology this week on the Kagro in the Morning show. I'm apparently not the only one to notice.

Monte Frank on another international embarrassment:

Just two weeks ago, a gunman entered a school in Georgia with an AK-47 and began shooting. An Australian baseball player was senselessly murdered in Oklahoma City. Elementary schools in Colorado hold drills where five-year-old kids hunker down behind tables while an ""active shooter"" knocks at the door. Just this week, Colorado voters ejected in recall elections two state senators who had sponsored new gun control laws in the wake of the Aurora cinema mass shooting. And the grim parade of gun violence in our cities marches on. This madness must end – and it will when Congress stops ignoring the will of the American people and makes our nation and the entire world safer by passing common-sense and constitutional gun safety measures. The vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, agree on what needs to be done to cure our gun violence epidemic, which will not only save lives, but spare America from embarrassment in the world.

More politics and policy below the fold."

Obama hits a wall in Berlin

The question of whether Barack Obama’s second term will be a failure was answered in the affirmative before his Berlin debacle, which has recast the question, which now is: Will this term be silly, even scary in its detachment from reality?

Before Berlin, Obama set his steep downward trajectory by squandering the most precious post-election months on gun-control futilities and by a subsequent storm of scandals that have made his unvarying project — ever bigger, more expansive, more intrusive and more coercive government — more repulsive. Then came Wednesday’s pratfall in Berlin.

There he vowed energetic measures against global warming (“the global threat of our time”). The 16-year pause of this warming was not predicted by, and is not explained by, the climate models for which, in his strange understanding of respect for science, he has forsworn skepticism.

Regarding another threat, he spoke an almost meaningless sentence that is an exquisite example of why his rhetoric cannot withstand close reading: “We may strike blows against terrorist networks, but if we ignore the instability and intolerance that fuels extremism, our own freedom will eventually be endangered.” So, “instability and intolerance” are to blame for terrorism? Instability where? Intolerance of what by whom “fuels” terrorists? Terrorism is a tactic of destabilization. Intolerance is, for terrorists, a virtue.

It is axiomatic: Arms control is impossible until it is unimportant. This is because arms control is an arena of competition in which nations negotiate only those limits that advance their interests. Nevertheless, Obama trotted out another golden oldie in Berlin when he vowed to resuscitate the cadaver of nuclear arms control with Russia. As though Russia’s arsenal is a pressing problem. And as though there is reason to think President Vladimir Putin, who calls the Soviet Union’s collapse “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” is interested in reducing the arsenal that is the basis of his otherwise Third World country’s claim to great-power status.

Shifting his strange focus from Russia’s nuclear weapons, Obama said “we can . . . reject the nuclear weaponization that North Korea and Iran may be seeking.” Were Obama given to saying such stuff off the cuff, this would be a good reason for handcuffing him to a teleprompter. But, amazingly, such stuff is put on his teleprompter and, even more amazing, he reads it aloud.

Neither the people who wrote those words nor he who spoke them can be taken seriously. North Korea and Iran may be seeking nuclear weapons? North Korea may have such weapons. Evidently Obama still entertains doubts that Iran is seeking them.

In Northern Ireland before going to Berlin, Obama sat next to Putin, whose demeanor and body language when he is in Obama’s presence radiate disdain. There Obama said: “With respect to Syria, we do have differing perspectives on the problem, but we share an interest in reducing the violence.” Differing perspectives?

Obama wants to reduce the violence by coaxing Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who is winning the war, to attend a conference at which he negotiates the surrender of his power. Putin wants to reduce the violence by helping — with lavish materiel assistance and by preventing diplomacy that interferes — Assad complete the destruction of his enemies.

Napoleon said: “If you start to take Vienna — take Vienna.” Douglas MacArthur said that all military disasters can be explained by two words: “Too late.” Regarding Syria, Obama is tentative and, if he insists on the folly of intervening, tardy. He is giving Putin a golden opportunity to humiliate the nation responsible for the “catastrophe.” In a contest between a dilettante and a dictator, bet on the latter.

Obama’s vanity is a wonder of the world that never loses its power to astonish, but really: Is everyone in his orbit too lost in raptures of admiration to warn him against delivering a speech soggy with banalities and bromides in a city that remembers John Kennedy’s “Ich bin ein Berliner” and Ronald Reagan’s “Tear down this wall”? With German Chancellor Angela Merkel sitting nearby, Obama began his Berlin speech: “As I’ve said, Angela and I don’t exactly look like previous German and American leaders.” He has indeed said that, too, before, at least about himself. It was mildly amusing in Berlin in 2008, but hardly a Noel Coward-like witticism worth recycling.

His look is just not that interesting. And after being pointless in Berlin, neither is he, other than for the surrealism of his second term.

“I am very concerned that this technology will be used against law-abiding American firearms owners,” said founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, Alan Gottlieb. “This could violate Fourth Amendment rights as well as Second Amendment rights.”

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) obtained a partially redacted copy of Homeland Security’s drone requirements through a Freedom of Information Act request; CNET uncovered an unredacted copy.

Homeland Security design requirements specify that its Predator B drones “shall be capable of identifying a standing human being at night as likely armed or not” and must be equipped with “interception” systems capable of reading cell phone signals.

The first known domestic use of a drone to arrest a U.S. citizen occurred last year in the small town of Lakota, North Dakota when rancher Rodney Brossart was arrested for refusing to return six of his neighbor’s cows that had wandered on to his property. Critics say the fact that domestic drones are being used in such minor matters raises serious concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.

“That drone is not just picking up information on what’s happening at that specific scene, it’s picking up everything else that’s going on,” says drone expert and Brookings Institution senior fellow Peter Singer. “Basically it’s recording footage from a lot of different people that it didn’t have their approval to record footage.”

Others, like progressive author Naomi Wolf, have warned that domestic drones may soon be weaponized. The military version of the Predator B drone carries 100-pound Hellfire missiles, but the Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) says the 10 drones in its domestic fleet are unarmed.

Last month, NBC News uncovered a confidential 16-page Justice Department memo that concluded the U.S. government may execute a drone strike on an American citizen it believes to be a “senior operational leader” of al-Qaeda or “an associated force.”

The Obama Administration defended the use of drones to kill Americans thought to be working with terrorists. “These strikes are legal, they are ethical, and they are wise,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney."

This afternoon, the FBI arrested Shannon Rogers Guess Richardson for sending ricin-tainted letters to Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and the head of Bloomberg's gun group. Richardson's husband, Nathaniel, is apparently doing just fine.

RELATED: Obama's New Ricin Letter Had the Same Text as Letter to Bloomberg Gun Group

Attention turned to Richardson when she called the FBI and told them that she suspected Nathaniel of sending the letters, which were received at the end of last month. (This is also worth noting: There are probably worse ways to draw attention to your illegal activity than to tell the FBI that you think someone in your house did it, but none come immediately to mind.) The FBI investigated and determined that Richardson was the most likely suspect. NBC News reported on the arrest in New Boston, Texas today, noting that the letters emphasized the recipients' opposition to new gun legislation.

In a statement to E! News on Monday, Richardson indicated that she was innocent.

I would not put my unborn child or other children in danger just to 'frame' someone. He simply needed someone to blame for what he has done and I was the obvious person for him to blame. Most of what is being reported in this case is absolutely inaccurate. That's all I can say.

Given the recent history of ricin-letter investigations, it's worth giving Richardson the benefit of the doubt. In April, authorities arrested-and-then-unarrested Elvis impersonator Paul Kevin Curtis for similarly sending letters to the president. James Everett Dutschke was indicted for the crime last week, bringing the total number of names involved in the arrested suspects in these cases to ten.

The easy-to-miss language was part of Obama's package of executive actions and legislative proposals that includes a new assault-weapons ban and universal background checks. The provision on doctors, though, has begun to generate just as much controversy.

""The idea that your doctor would ask you if you have firearms in your house as part of an examination of your health is repugnant,"" National Rifle Association President David Keene told Fox News on Thursday, accusing the administration of trying to ""demonize firearms"" by implying that owning them is a ""health problem.""

One of the 23 executive actions Obama approved Wednesday was to ""clarify"" that the federal health care overhaul ""does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about gun in their homes.""

An overview of the plan said ""we should never ask doctors and other health care providers to turn a blind eye to the risks posed by guns in the wrong hands.""

Coupled with the language on asking patients about guns was a decision to ""clarify"" that no federal law prevents doctors from warning law enforcement about ""direct and credible threats of violence.""

The latter provision is actually in line with the policy of most states. All but a few allow mental health professionals to report information about patients they believe may become violent. Of them, most have laws requiring that information to be disclosed -- New York was one of the latest to update its law to mandate that doctors report when patients might pose a danger.

Conservative columnist and Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer, who is a psychiatrist, said this language from Obama ""doesn't change anything at all"" -- he tried to assuage any concern about the provision.

But the line that appeared to encourage doctors to ask about guns in the home is what drew the ire of pro-gun rights lawmakers on Capitol Hill. They voiced concern that this could lead to doctors asking inappropriate and probing questions of their patients.

""President Obama has no business interjecting himself in the doctor-patient relationship by pressuring medical professionals to ask their patients what kind of guns they own in their homes. President Obama's latest executive orders give new meaning to the term 'house call,'"" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said in a statement.

Rep. John Fleming, R-La., himself a physician, accused Obama of ""pushing the government further into the exam room.""

""He's trying to press doctors into government service by pushing them to ask patients, even child patients, if there are guns in their home. After more than thirty years of operating a family practice, I can tell you it should not be the business of a family physician to take inventory of the guns in a patient's home,"" he said, noting that there are already laws ensuring that doctors warn authorities about criminal activity.

Still, despite Republicans' objections, the American Psychiatric Association has actually pushed for such a clarification from the administration.

""We are glad that the president has clarified that doctors are not prohibited from asking their patients about guns in their homes,"" the group said.

Howard Zonana, a professor in the Yale Department of Psychiatry, said that while it may be controversial for doctors in other fields to ask about firearms, it's virtually standard practice among psychiatrists.

""That is part and parcel of any suicide risk assessment,"" he told FoxNews.com. ""That's standard psychiatric practice and negligent if you don't do it.""

In most cases, he said, the psychiatrist would, if a patient acknowledges owning a gun, talk to that patient about it first. But, he said, if a patient is considered suicidal and not doing anything about his or her guns, ""my threshold for having them hospitalized is going to be lower.""

The administration argues that doctors ""need to be able to ask about firearms"" and how those firearms are stored, ""especially if their patients show signs of certain mental illnesses"" -- or if there's a young child or mentally ill family member at home.

Even Fleming acknowledged it's important ""that people who are a known danger to others do not have access to guns."" He just doesn't think it's a doctor's role.

The 2010 Affordable Care Act did include language meant to protect Second Amendment rights. Though it does not prohibit doctors from asking about firearms, the law states that the government cannot require that information to be disclosed either.

Further, the law said gun ownership cannot be used to determine insurance premium rates."

Story highlights Syria says chemical weapons resolution applies to all parties U.S., Russia warn of consequences if Syria does not abide to resolution Kerry says world community imposing binding obligation on Syria Another body agrees to fast-track Syria entry into Chemical Weapons Convention

(CNN) —

The U.N. Security Council, capping a dramatic month of diplomacy, voted unanimously late Friday to require Syria to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons – or face consequences.

“Today’s resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability,” Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.

The U.N. resolution was based on a deal struck this month between the United States and Russia that averted an American military strike over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb that U.S. officials said left at least 1,400 people dead.

The resolution did not authorize the automatic use of force if Syria is said to be in violation, as was previously sought by the United States.

The 15-member Security Council met shortly after the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, voted to fast-track Syria’s addition to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans such weapons.

For nearly two years, the U.N. Security Council had been unable to reach a consensus over what to do to bring about an end to Syria’s civil war. Russia and China repeatedly vetoed resolutions dating back to October 2011 that condemned President Bashar al-Assad’s government and called for him to step down.

The turnaround came this month, when Russia called for Syria to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after U.S. President Barack Obama accused Syria of crossing a “red line” with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike.

Syria announced this month that it was willing to join the agreement.

A binding obligation

Both the United States and Russia warned that if Syria failed to adhere to the terms of the U.N. resolution, it would face consequences.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world community was imposing a binding obligation on the government of al-Assad to get rid of its stockpile.

“This resolution makes clear that those responsible for this heinous act must be held accountable,” said Kerry.

If the resolution succeeds, the world “will have eliminated one of the largest chemical weapon arsenals on Earth, eliminating it from one of the most volatile places on Earth,” Kerry said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the council that his country, long an ally of the Syrian government, “will stand ready to take action” if the resolution needs enforcement.

By agreeing to dismantle its chemical weapons program and provide documentation of its arsenal, “Damascus has shown its readiness to cooperate,” said Lavrov.

Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the resolution holds all parties in Syria accountable for the use of chemical weapons.

Inspectors return to Syria

U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Syria this week to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use – some allegedly by the government, others allegedly by rebels.

U.N. inspectors have already confirmed the use of chemical warfare in the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh in August, but have not explicitly said who was responsible.

The al-Assad government has repeatedly accused rebels of using chemical weapons, an assertion that has been widely dismissed by most Western leaders.

The United Nations estimates more than 100,000 people have died since March 2011 when a brutal government crackdown against protesters devolved into an all-out civil war.

The Security Council vote followed action by the executive council of the OPCW, meeting in the Netherlands. That group adopted its measure by consensus in about 10 minutes.

“We now have a legal mandate to start a verification mission in Syria,” OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan.

The OPCW agreed to an “accelerated program for achieving the complete elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014,” it said in a statement. Inspections in Syria will begin Tuesday.

“The decision also calls for ambitious milestones for destruction, which will be set by the council by 15 November,” the organization said.

Obama: ‘Very hopeful’

Obama, speaking before the votes, said he was “very hopeful” about the developments, but warned much work remains to be done.

“I think, rightly, people have been concerned about whether Syria will follow through on the commitments that have been laid forth and I think there are legitimate concerns as to how technically we are going to be getting those chemical weapons out while there’s still fighting going on the ground,” Obama said.

Obama said the threat of U.S. military power pushed Syrian leaders to agree to destroy their chemical weapons and said the resolution “not only deters and prevents additional chemical use but actually goes beyond what could have been accomplished through any military action.”

The OPCW plans to send an advance team of inspectors to Damascus, an official with the organization, who declined to be identified while discussing delicate operations, told CNN on Friday.

The official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons, the group may opt for a “quick and dirty” program that would render the weapons unusable but wouldn’t destroy them, the official said.

U.S. official: Syrian CW list more complete than anticipated

’Not a license to kill’

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has said his country is willing to transport and destroy Syrian chemical weapons, although only as part of an international coalition.

Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier in September took to The New York Times to argue against military intervention in Syria.

Striking Syria would have many negative ramifications, Putin argued in the piece, including the killing of innocent people, spreading violence around the Middle East, clouding diplomatic efforts to address Iran’s nuclear crisis and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and “unleash(ing) a new wave of terrorism.”

In his remarks Friday night, Ban called on both the Syrian government and rebels to stop the fighting.

“As we mark this important step, we must never forget that the catalog of horrors in Syria continues with bombs and tanks, grenades and guns,” he said. “A red light for one form of weapons does not mean a green light for others. This is not a license to kill with conventional weapons.”

Syria submits ‘initial disclosure’ of chemical weapons program

’No meaningful enforcement mechanisms’

Two Republican U.S. senators criticized the Security Council vote, saying it will do little to end the civil war.

“This resolution is another triumph of hope over reality,” John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement. “It contains no meaningful or immediate enforcement mechanisms, let alone a threat of the use of force for the Assad regime’s noncompliance.”

The pair said al-Assad’s forces will continue to “use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons” on the Syrian people while receiving outside assistance from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah while doing so.

Story highlights William Bennett: Here is some advice for the GOP in the second Obama term Bennett: Don't just blame GOP leadership; the choice of the people also matters He says conservatives must win the cultural war to change political institutions Bennett: The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished for it

Editor’s Note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of “The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood.” He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush.

If President Barack Obama’s inaugural address was any indication, his second term will be a doubling down of the progressive, big government agenda.

With that in mind, here is some advice for conservatives and the Republican Party for the next four years of Obama’s presidency:

Don’t blame the GOP leadership

William Bennett

First and foremost, if we are to prevail, we cannot afford to continue firing upon and wounding or maiming our own soldiers and officers. We need everyone in the fight.

It is more difficult to be in a position of governance, such as John Boehner, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, than a journalist, pundit or conservative talk show host. Trust me, I’ve been in both arenas. It’s much harder to be Boehner and the Republican leadership than it is to be Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Medved, etc.

Unlike those who operate solely in the arenas of commentary, opinion and philosophy, Republicans in Washington bear the responsibility and burden of actual governance, where ideological purity must often yield to compromise. Much of the blame placed at the feet of Republican leadership by many in the party or the commentariat lies not with the party or its leaders but ultimately, as in all things with a democratic republic, with the choice of the people.

Face reality

William Buckley aptly described conservatism as the politics of reality. As such, we must recognize the realities of political governance. You cannot govern unless you have power. That is, Republicans cannot govern with control of only one half of one third of the branches of government.

They can block and prevent, but they cannot impose. Our agenda, our goals and our expectations should be oriented to these facts of reality.

It’s the culture, stupid

Conservatives are losing the culture war when, according to a 2011 Pew Research poll, 49% of Americans ages 18-29 have a positive view of socialism while just 46% have a positive view of capitalism. Such views are the products of our education system and the movies, music and entertainment young Americans consume. We must change those cultural institutions before we can truly change our political institutions in the long term.

The roots of our cultural and educational outreach must be as far reaching as the left’s. This means broadening our scope of influence outside Fox News and conservative talk radio and into the left’s strongholds of Hollywood and higher education. Perhaps some of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on PACs could be better spent taking back the culture.

Play offense

In politics, as in sports, you’re either on offense or you’re on defense. Be on offense. This is a simple maxim, but one too often neglected.

He who initiates sets the terms of debate and forces the dialogue on his terms. Gov. Scott Walker’s aggressive fiscal reforms in Wisconsin are an example of effective political offense.

Elevate the next generation

During the 2012 presidential primaries, conservatives often lamented the absence of rising Republican stars such as Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Gov. Susana Martinez, Gov. Scott Walker, Rep. Paul Ryan and so on. Our bench is strong, but now it’s time for the bench to take the field.

Politics: After inauguration, political reality returns to Washington

Consequences of big government

The American people must realize for what they voted when they re-elected Obama and a Democratic-controlled Senate. So far, they’ve been immunized from many of the consequences. But now, with the expiration of the payroll tax cut and the gradual implementation of ObamaCare, the taxes of almost all Americans have risen, along with many of their health care premiums.

Conservatives must draw the direct link between higher taxes and premiums and Democratic policies. As St. Paul instructs, misery teaches lessons that success doesn’t. The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished and made to pay for it in immiseration.

Don’t become cynical

Do not make people more cynical or pessimistic about politics or the political system. Every day on my radio show, I hear of people withdrawing from the political arena into a cocoon of disengagement and discouragement. We cannot allow this to happen.

We must encourage the American people to be active and involved in important policy decisions.

It was the great novelist Walker Percy who warned of America’s downfall, not at the hand of a great outside power, but from crumbling within.

Politics: Republicans assess Obama’s address

“Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom … gradually subside into decay through default and be defeated, not by the communist movement, but from within, from weariness, boredom, cynicism, greed and in the end helplessness before its great problems,” Percy said.

We must get our heads up. As Margaret Thatcher said to us often, “Don’t go wobbly,” and, “Cheer up. America is a strong country.”

Proposed law is ""a statement against the coming surveillance society,"" its author says

But federal law prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property

City officials aim for financial gain, fun; state official cites Coloradans' sense of humor

Deer Trail, a small Colorado town, is considering a measure that would allow its residents to hunt for federal drones and shoot them down.

""Is it illegal? Of course it is. But it's also illegal to spy on American citizens,"" resident Phillip Steel told CNN in a phone interview. ""If they fly in town, we will shoot them down.""

Steel said he wrote the ordinance after he learned the Federal Aviation Administration ""loosened regulations that would allow the flight of drones in domestic airspace.""

The FAA recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country, none of which has been publicly listed. It plans to allow widespread use of domestic drones in 2015 . ""The overall purpose of this test site program is to develop a body of data and operational experiences to inform integration and the safe operation of these aircraft in the National Airspace System,"" the agency said.

Drones are cheaper to operate than helicopters. They can be used for multiple tasks, such as monitoring crops and livestock and assessing building damage.

Deer Trail, which bills itself as the ""Home of the World's First Rodeo,"" has 584 residents and is 50 miles outside Aurora. The entire town takes up less than one square mile. Any resident can petition for a citizens' initiative and then draft an ordinance.

Bounties and shotguns

The Town Board of Trustees will vote on the drone ordinance on August 6. If passed, it would legalize the sale of drone hunting licenses for $25 and offer bounties for captured drones. Six trustees and the mayor make up the board. It would take a simple majority vote to pass the ordinance.

""It is very symbolic ... it's asserting our right and drawing a line in the sand,"" Steel said. ""It declares sovereignty of the airspace.""

The ordinance doesn't aim to stop airliner flights, he said. It outlines the rules of engagement for drone hunters and the types of ammunition allowed. Bounty amounts from $25 to $100, and weapons are limited to 12-gauge shotguns.

It states that ""no background investigation shall be performed"" on those seeking a drone hunting license. Additionally, the licenses would be ""issued on an anonymous basis.""

""Unmanned aerial vehicles may be engaged at a vertical distance of one thousand feet or less,"" and the ""licenses shall only remain valid within the geographic boundaries of the Town of Deer Trail, Colorado,"" according to the ordinance.

Federal legislation ( 18 USC 1361 ) prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property and establishes provisions for fines and imprisonment.

The illegality of the actions within the ordinance doesn't scare Steel.

""I took an oath when I joined the military to protect the U.S. Constitution. That oath did not end when I left,"" he said.

When asked if he had ever seen a drone in Deer Trail, Steel said, ""In real life, no. I hope I never see a drone in Deer Trail. ... This ordinance is a statement against the coming surveillance society. It's a very clear statement against that.""

""In all practicality, nobody is going to shoot down any drones any time soon,"" he added.

'Our mark on the map'

Town Clerk Kim Oldfield says she believes the ordinance could benefit the town.

""This could actually be something to help fund a community center or build us some roads. We need to find our mark on the map,"" Oldfield said. ""The novelty of being allowed to buy a drone-hunting license could turn into a fun thing.""

Board of Trustees member David Boyd said the ordinance has a good chance of passing.

""I think it's important. I know Phil Steel also wants to make a statement about drones. ... Mostly for us, the outcome we want will be to have some fun and make some money,"" Boyd said.

Deer Trail Mayor Frank Fields says he agrees with Boyd. He said the purpose of the ordinance would be ""to have fun and bring in business, tourism and activities for people in town.""

Colorado Attorney General John W. Suthers said state residents have a sense of humor. He responded to the idea of the ordinance by saying, ""A resolution by the town of Deer Trail to allow the hunting of drones is made in the same spirit as the proposal of some rural Coloradans to create a separate state. And both ideas have the same chance to legally succeed: none."""

A look at the year so far for the president, his advisers and his family, by official White House photographer Pete Souza and others.

Five months after his resounding reelection victory, President Obama is bumping up against the boundaries of his political power in Washington as the core of his second-term legislative agenda moves into a still-divided Congress.

His ability to secure the three high-profile legislative items now confronting Congress — gun-control measures, reform of the immigration system and his long-term budget priorities — is likely to determine his domestic legacy. Obama’s plan now is to ensure that as much of his politically challenging agenda as possible is enacted, after months of effort to frame the policies for the American public and, perhaps more important, for the House and Senate.

Each of the issues that Obama is pursuing is being managed independently by the second-term White House team — an improvisational strategy that is testing the president’s ability to calibrate when to get involved and when to stay out of the way.

But senior administration officials acknowledge that only immigration legislation has a chance of resembling Obama’s ideal bill once it emerges from the Democratic-run Senate and the Republican-controlled House.

On his other major initiatives, they say Obama would settle for less than he claims he wants, a sign that he remains pragmatic in the face of partisan opposition that continues to limit his ambitions.

“I have the same worry about all of these issues, and it’s the Republican House,” said Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama senior adviser.

Obama outlined a broad progressive agenda in his second inaugural address, and he has spoken frequently about the validation that he believes the public gave his plans by reelecting him last year. But second-term presidents traditionally have less than two years to secure a legislative agenda before lame-duck status sets in, and Obama already has seen his popular support shrink in recent months from its post-

election highs.

The election also did not change the basic political dynamic in Washington: a Democratic president in conflict with congressional Republicans, only some of whom believe last year’s election represented a call for compromise.

Each morning, the new White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, reviews the overall legislative progress with senior staff. Inside the White House, each issue has a group responsible for its day-to-day management on Capitol Hill.

The strategy has led Obama to alternately court Senate Republicans — as he did last week in his second such dinner with a dozen of them — and to scold them before outside-the-Beltway audi-

ences, as he did this month in denouncing GOP threats to block gun-control legislation. Advisers say he does so to keep the political momentum alive in Washington for measures with strong public support outside the capital.

After months of campaigning for his agenda, two of his priorities appear to be inching through the Democratic-controlled Senate: a compromise on gun-purchase background checks was announced last week and another deal is expected this week on immigration.

But the budget he announced last week, which proposed restricting cost-of-living increases for Social Security, appears to have angered his own supporters more than it has convinced Republicans. It is an issue on which his strongest political leverage lies in going against his own party.

“I think they put something on the table which no Democrat should ever put on the table,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “It’s not okay to be bargained with. The risk is that voters mistakenly identify his budget priorities with all of ours.”

Immigration

After outlining what he wants in an immigration bill, Obama has largely taken a hands-off approach to designing the legislation, now the subject of negotiations among a bipartisan group of senators known as the Gang of Eight.

The strategy was adopted soon after his second-term inauguration, when Obama, eager to push the issue after winning more than 70 percent of the Latino vote, prepared to introduce his own bill during a visit to Las Vegas to break a long-standing deadlock among Senate negotiators.

Administration officials said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a Gang of Eight member, called the White House a few days before the Jan. 29 event. Schumer said the group was close to reaching consensus on a bill and asked Obama to hold off on announcing his own in order to avoid disrupting the talks.

Obama agreed.

“On any issue where there is progress being made, we don’t want to get in the way,” said a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the White House legislative strategy and assess its prospects. “Every one of these issues has potential pitfalls and potential opportunities.”

Inside the White House, the issue is being managed by Cecilia Muñoz, director of the Domestic Policy Council. Administration officials acknowledge that immigration is the issue on which they can be the most patient, given that many Republicans are eager to repair relations with the fast-growing Latino electorate after the November election.

While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill.

“We know we have the upper hand on immigration,” the administration official said, acknowledging that Obama has far less sway when it comes to gun-

control measures and the budget.

Guns

Obama has employed an outside-the-Beltway strategy on guns, traveling to the sites of mass shootings to implore Congress to take action.

White House aides believe that the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December, in which a gunman killed 20 children and six adult staff members, created the first political moment in decades for Congress to tighten gun laws. A large majority of the public supports tighter restrictions, but many in Congress would rather not confront the powerful gun rights lobby.

Obama’s aides also worry that the political environment could change quickly unless the president keeps pressuring Congress to act, which he did Monday when he visited the University of Hartford in the company of Newtown parents.

This weekend, for the first time ever, Obama turned his weekly radio address over to someone other than Vice President Biden: Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son, Ben, was fatally shot in Newtown’s Sandy Hook Elementary School.

“Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy,” Wheeler said, adding that the Senate hasn’t “yet passed any bills that will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. “

The president began the year with a sweeping set of proposals to ban military-style assault weapons, limit the size of ammunition magazines, require background checks for virtually all weapons sales and increase funding for mental health care, among other issues.

Yet it has become increasingly clear to the administration that most of the ambitious ideas don’t have enough support to pass Congress. The issue is being managed by Biden’s office, and the White House is trying to strike a balance between when to pressure lawmakers and when to accept a compromise, even if it is far more modest than originally envisioned.

Obama took the latter approach last week when he praised a bipartisan deal to expand background checks, while acknowledging it is not as expansive as he wanted.

Advisers concede that the most high-profile of the Obama proposals — renewing the expired federal ban on assault weapons — has virtually no chance of becoming law.

“You have to have an analysis of the possible,” the senior administration official said. “Anything we do on guns is a positive for the country.”

Budget

Obama’s continuing struggles over the budget, perhaps more than anything else, show the limits of his power.

White House officials believe that Obama won the public argument over taxes and spending in the recent presidential election — a long “outside game” that Obama hopes will translate into leverage inside the Beltway.

Now the administration is trying to coax Republicans into a budget compromise that would replace across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, that took effect last month and undercut Obama’s vision for how to build the economy.

Last week, Obama presented a budget that he said did not reflect his ideal view but that he believes might appeal to moderate Republicans looking to put fiscal fights behind them.

The budget fully incorporates the offer Obama made to House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in December during “fiscal cliff” talks, embracing policies such as cuts to Social Security benefits that are noxious to many Democrats.

Obama is counting on preliminary discussions to try to reconcile separate budgets passed by House Republicans and Senate Democrats last month, although it’s not clear whether those talks will reach a more serious phase.

As Congress goes through that process, Obama plans to continue reaching out to Republicans who may be open to a deal.

“There’s an awful lot of work to be done,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) after the latest GOP dinner with Obama on Wednesday. “But these overtures are encouraging.”

White House aides are looking for help from lawmakers such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who organized the guest list for the first dinner with Obama and suggested he would be open to a compromise that raises revenue in exchange for significant entitlement reform.

But White House officials acknowledge there is no clear path toward a deal, meaning that sequester spending cuts are likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future.

The budget process is being handled by the same men who have been running it for several years: National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors. Any progress on the budget will rely on Republicans agreeing to at least some degree of higher tax revenue, White House officials said, by way of scaling back tax breaks that benefit the wealthy.

Administration officials say the only hope of getting an agreement through the House is to have resounding support in the Senate. They concede they will need to work to get even some Democrats on board given the changes to Social Security now on the table.

“The best strategy for the House is to do as well as we can in the Senate,” the administration official said. “Step two is to get as many Democrats as possible.”

Many Congressional Republicans say they are bracing for Mr. Obama to blame them for any problems with the legislative process.

“I do get the sense that everything for this administration seems to be a day-to-day tactical decision, rather than a legislative strategy of how to get things passed,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. “That’s not the same as doing what it takes to get work done.”

Process could also prove an enemy. Senate leaders will need 60 votes to even start on a bill, but before then they will have to ponder numerous amendments from the left and right — all of which could injure the bill’s chances in both camps. In fact, when Mr. Obama was a senator, he fought for a “poison pill” amendment in 2007 to phase out a guest-worker program favored by Republicans, an amendment that, when attached to the bill, helped sink it.

Some House members have already started to go their own way with far more modest, incremental proposals. Republicans there will certainly produce a far different bill from the Senate’s. Should the Senate and House end up in a conference to reconcile two bills, the final measure may well end up closer to that produced in the Senate, as has been the case with other bills that have gone to conference.

If this happens, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, might be presented with the excruciating choice of bringing a more liberal version of legislation to the House floor or failing to close the deal on immigration reform that many in his party believe is needed.

Perhaps the most important factor in the bill’s favor is its broad support among a wide variety of constituencies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the agricultural industry, labor unions and many church groups. Unlike the gun legislation, the immigration bill has no strong single opponent analogous to the National Rifle Association. Immigration legislation also has a compelling advocate in the Senate."

Chris Christie permitted under law to appoint temporary replacement

(CNN) —

Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat associated with major legislative achievements over five terms in the U.S. Senate and the chamber’s last surviving World War II veteran, died on Monday of viral pneumonia, his office said.

Lautenberg, 89, missed key Senate votes late last year during a weeks-long absence because of a cold that turned into what he called a “severe case of bronchitis with fluid in the chest.” He also battled stomach cancer in recent years.

He announced in a statement in February that he would not seek re-election next year, but he continued to push for stronger gun control laws.

After last month’s Boston Marathon bombings, Lautenberg said he would reintroduce legislation to require background checks for sales of explosive powder.

An influential businessman-turned-legislator, Lautenberg scored big victories in Congress, including a ban on smoking on airplanes, preventing domestic abusers from possessing guns, cracking down on drunken driving, and the “Toxic Right to Know” law about the release of pollutants into communities.

“Frank Lautenberg has been one of the most productive senators in the history of this country,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in December 2011 on the occasion of Lautenberg’s 9,000th vote, the statement by Lautenberg’s office said.

On Monday, political colleagues and foes lauded Lautenberg as a passionate advocate for the issues he championed.

Lautenberg: The last ‘swamp dog’

“He improved the lives of countless Americans with his commitment to our nation’s health and safety, from improving our public transportation to protecting citizens from gun violence to ensuring that members of our military and their families get the care they deserve,” said a statement by President Barack Obama, a former senator.

Secretary of State John Kerry, in remarks to reporters, called his longtime fellow Democratic senator “tenacious as a legislator” and someone who “never forgot where he came from.”

In particular, Kerry cited Lautenberg’s advocacy for environmental issues and his spirited defense of Kerry’s military record when it came under attack by Republicans in the 2004 presidential election campaign.

“He was as loyal as he was patriotic,” Kerry said, also noting how “during the years when Frank was going through chemotherapy and he was weakened by cancer, he was still down there on the floor of the United States Senate floor fighting on every environmental debate late into the night.”

New Jersey’s Republican governor, Chris Christie, told a GOP event on Monday that he often disagreed politically with Lautenberg, but he respected the senator’s battling spirit.

“We had some good fights over our time – battles on philosophy and the role of government,” Christie said. “I think the best way to describe Frank Lautenberg and the way he would probably want to be described to all of you today is as a fighter. Senator Lautenberg fought for the things he believed in and sometimes he just fought because he liked to.”

Lautenberg leaves tricky political question for Christie

According to New Jersey law, Christie can appoint a temporary replacement to serve until a special election in November or fill the rest of Lautenberg’s term, which expires next year.

With the likelihood that Christie will appoint a Republican, the Democratic majority in the 100-member Senate would decrease to 52, along with two independents who caucus with the Democrats.

Possible GOP appointees would include state Sens. Thomas Kean Jr. and Joe Kyrillos, a Christie ally who lost to Democrat Bob Menendez in the Senate race last year; Lt Gov. Kim Guadagno, and Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick.

On the Democratic side, Newark Mayor Cory Booker announced in January he intended to run for the Senate next year, which caused a public tiff with Lautenberg, who later decided against seeking re-election.

The son of Russian and Polish immigrants, Lautenberg grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, and enlisted in the military at 18, his office said. He was a member of the United States Army Signal Corps from 1942 to 1946, according to his biography.

After the military, he graduated from Columbia University with the help of the GI Bill, then joined with two boyhood friends to start payroll processing firm Automatic Data Processing, or ADP, which grew into one of the world’s largest computing services companies.

Lautenberg was first elected to the Senate in 1982 and won re-election twice. He did not seek re-election in 2000 when his third term expired, but was recruited to run again two years later after Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli quit his re-election bid weeks before the polls opened amid reports of ethical issues. Lautenberg was then re-elected in 2008.

Survivors include his wife, Bonnie Englebardt Lautenberg; six children; and 13 grandchildren, the office statement said.

Story highlights Campus Pride says it received philanthropic foundation's tax forms WinShape Foundation quit funding some controversial groups in 2011, official says Chick-fil-A president sparked debate last year with comments on same-sex marriage Campus Pride's leader says he's developed relationship with Chick-fil-A chief

Chick-fil-A restaurants’ philanthropic WinShape Foundation no longer funds the most controversial and politically charged anti-same-sex-marriage groups and has not since 2011, according to Campus Pride, a leading national LGBT campus organization.

Campus Pride issued a statement Monday claiming that Chick-fil-A gave the organization’s executive director, Shane Windmeyer, access to WinShape’s 2011 “990” tax documents.

He said they show that the nearly $6 million in outside grant funding “focuses on youth, education, marriage enrichment and local communities” and that in the list of the foundation’s beneficiaries, “the most divisive, anti-LGBT groups are no longer listed.” Among those groups were the Family Research Council, Eagle Forum and Exodus International.

Windmeyer acknowledged that WinShape continues to fund groups that don’t condone same-sex marriage based on biblical beliefs but says these groups, such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, don’t operate with the same hard-nosed political agenda the other groups are known for.

Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy sparked controversy last July when he weighed in on same-sex marriage, telling The Baptist Press, “We are very much supportive of the family – the biblical definition of the family unit.”

Gay rights groups were most incensed about the chain’s financial support for what they called anti-gay groups.

The ensuing debate included politicians from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum.

Some proponents of same-sex marriage called for a boycott of the chain, which had annual sales of more than $4.1 billion last year. It has more than 1,615 locations in 39 states and Washington, and they are closed on Sundays.

Many who agreed with Cathy took the opportunity to share their beliefs on August 1, dubbed “Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day” by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Their purchase of chicken sandwiches and nuggets to show their support for the restaurant chain and its president brought the restaurant chain record sales.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation then promoted a National Same-Sex Kiss Day at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country on August 3.

“Students on college campuses have been concerned with the giving practices of Chick-fil-A for years,” Windmeyer said. “Those comments just added fuel to the fire.”

Students protested on both sides of the issue, and some schools weighed the possibility of removing Chick fil-A from cafeterias and dining halls. However, Windmeyer says many people – perhaps even himself – did not take the opportunity to embrace the opportunity for civil discussion on the issue.

“There was a lot of divisiveness and hate on both sides,” said Windmeyer. “It was like the Chick-fil-A brand was a chicken sandwich with purpose.”

What does free speech mean to you? Chick-fil-A debate strikes nerve

Windmeyer says Cathy called him August 10. He expected an argument, yelling, anger, maybe even a lawyer to jump on the line, but instead there was an hour-long private conversation.

After months of conversations, e-mails and text messages, Windmeyer says, he has developed a personal relationship with Cathy, met his family and even attended the Chick-fil-A Bowl, a college football game on New Year’s Eve.

“It is about opposing viewpoints, not opposing people,” Windmeyer said. “Dan cares about young people and was upset to hear how his company was being used to hurt LGBT students.”

Campus Pride says that after Windmeyer and Cathy began to discuss their beliefs and points of view, it suspended a national college campaign against the restaurant in an “effort to find common ground” around the values of respect and dignity Chick fil-A published on its website.

“The Chick-fil-A controversy continues to impact the lives of LGBT students and provides an opportunity for every college campus to assess their LGBT institutional commitment,” Windmeyer said. “Administrators have a responsibility to ensure a safe learning environment and should recognize the toll of the controversy by committing resources and services to ensure LGBT students feel safe and welcome on campus.”

Neither Chick-fil-A nor the WinShape Foundation returned calls seeking comment.

According to its website, Chick-fil-A – a privately held chicken restaurant chain – has more than 1,615 locations in 39 states and Washington, D.C., with annual sales of over $4.1 billion in 2011.

Opinion: The right way and the wrong way to protest Chick-fil-A

WinShape Foundation filed the tax forms on November 15, according to Campus Pride, and they are public information that will be released by the IRS when it deems fit.

Tax-exempt organizations and nonprofits such as the WinShape Foundation must file 990 documents each year and release a list of organizations that received support."

He Sketches The Foolish', 'The Fallacious', 'The Felonious In Politics.']",Dana Milbank: Sen. Ted Cruz proving a talkative headache for GOP leaders,"Is there nobody who can tell Ted Cruz to shut up?

The young senator from Texas has been on the job for about 100 days, but he has already turned the Senate’s ancient seniority system upside down and is dominating his senior Republican colleagues. He’s speaking for them on immigration, guns and any other topic that tickles his fancy; Republican leaders are seething at being outshone yet are terrified of challenging him.

Consider his news conference this week to promote the Republican alternative to gun control. With Cruz on the stage in the Senate TV studio: the bill’s primary author, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a 32-year Senate veteran and longtime chairman or ranking member of the finance and judiciary committees; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina (10 years in the Senate and eight in the House); and Dan Coats of Indiana (12 years in the Senate and eight in the House).

But Cruz took over the lectern and refused to relinquish it. He spoke 2,924 words for the cameras, more than Grassley (904), Graham (1,376) and Coats (360) — combined. Factoring in his dramatic pauses to convey sincerity and deep thought, Cruz’s dominance was even more lopsided. The others shifted uncomfortably and looked awkwardly around the room. At one point, Graham requested a chance to speak. “Can I?” he asked Cruz.

Cruz is 42, the same age Joe McCarthy was when he amassed power in the Senate with his allegations of communist infiltration. Tail-gunner Ted debuted in the Senate this year with the insinuation that Chuck Hagel, now the defense secretary, may have been on the payroll of the North Koreans. Cruz also wrote in Politico that “Hagel’s nomination has been publicly celebrated by the Iranian government.” He later alleged that Democrats had told the Catholic Church to “change your religious beliefs or we’ll use our power in the federal government to shut down your charities and your hospitals.”

Now Cruz is turning his incendiary allegations against fellow Republicans. On immigration, he has described as amnesty the compromise that Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and three other Republicans negotiated with Democrats. Cruz said such a plan would make “a chump” of legal immigrants. On guns, he said the background checks Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) negotiated in a bipartisan compromise would lead to a national gun registry — an outcome the doomed proposal explicitly prohibited.

Democrats see a potential bogeyman in Cruz because of his outrageous pronouncements, and reporters love his inflammatory quotes. Republican leaders, however, don’t know how to control this monster they created.

GOP lawmakers encouraged the rise of the tea party, which now dominates Republican primaries and threatens the same leaders who nurtured it. Cruz’s fellow Texan, John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, could face a primary challenge next year and therefore can’t afford to cross Cruz, who beat an establishment Republican in the 2012 primary. Likewise, the Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is up for reelection and has to keep on the good side of tea party favorites such as Sen. Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, and Cruz.

I’ve argued before that Cruz is more cunning than ideological. He’s Ivy League-educated and a skilled debater who has perfected a look of faux earnestness that suggests his every pronouncement is the most important oration since Gettysburg. Cruz has correctly calculated that the way to power among Senate Republicans is through attention-grabbing accusations.

On immigration, his Latino credentials have helped him undermine Rubio’s bipartisanship. When Rubio made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows April 14, he was confronted with Cruz’s criticism by both NBC’s David Gregory and ABC’s Jon Karl.

On guns, Cruz’s high profile required Grassley to give the upstart a premium chunk of floor time for his trademark falsehoods. Cruz claimed that his bill was the “result of multiple hearings in the Judiciary Committee.” (It was never brought before the panel.) He claimed the opposing legislation would extend “background checks to private transactions between private individuals.” (The bill applied to only advertised sales.) Off the floor, he made the patently false claim that the “so-called ‘gun show loophole’ ” doesn’t exist.

If Republicans are willing to look the other way when Cruz assaults the facts, they may find it increasingly grating to endure his assaults on their dignity. At their news conference on guns, Grassley was made to stand silently for half an hour while Cruz gave an eight-minute opening statement (more than twice the length of Grassley’s) and fielded six questions before yielding to his senior colleague. “I’m just going to say one thing,” Grassley said, “and then I’m going to have to go.”

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) speaks at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority Conference in Washington on Thursday. (Charles Dharapak/AP)

After spending years unsuccessfully trying to overturn “Obamacare,” Republicans are now attempting to use President Obama’s landmark health-care law to derail his top second-term initiative — a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.

Conservatives in both chambers of Congress are insisting on measures that would expand the denial of public health benefits to the nation’s 11 million illegal immigrants beyond limits set in a comprehensive bill pending in the Senate.

In the House, Republicans are considering proposals that would deny publicly subsidized emergency care to illegal immigrants and force them to purchase private health insurance plans, without access to federal subsidies, as a requirement for earning permanent legal residency.

In the Senate, Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has endorsed an amendment to a comprehensive immigration bill he helped negotiate that would deny health benefits to immigrants for five years after they become legal residents — two years after they would be eligible to become citizens under the legislation.

Some Republicans, eager to capi­tal­ize on public uncertainty about the complexities of the Affordable Care Act, are casting the immigration legislation as a similarly unwieldy law.

The immigration bill “reminds me of a more recent piece of legislation: Obamacare,” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said on the Senate floor last week. “It grants broad new powers to the same executive branch that today is mired in scandal for incompetence and abuse of power. Total cost estimates are in the trillions. And rather than fix our current immigration problems, the bill makes many of them worse.”

The insertion of the politics of health-care reform — one of the most polarizing issues in Washington — into the immigration debate threatens to split open the emerging bipartisan coalitions that are crucial to passing a bill.

This month, Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho) blamed a standoff over health-care benefits for his decision to drop out of bipartisan talks with seven colleagues who were negotiating a House alternative to the Senate immigration proposal. That has forced House leaders to proceed with a series of smaller-scale proposals next week in lieu of a sweeping agreement.

“When I joined the group, I was told that the aliens would have to pay for their own health care,” Labrador told Fox News. “Now that has changed. And I can’t agree to all of the exceptions.”

Frustrated Democrats argue that Republicans are picking a fight where one does not exist. In both chambers, Democrats say, they have agreed that illegal immigrants would not be eligible for public benefits — including health-care subsidies and Medicaid — as they embark on a path to permanent legal status, which would take at least 10 years under the Senate plan.

“We have said since Day One . . . that undocumented people will not have access to subsidies in the Affordable Care Act,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last month. “Any thought that we want to do something different than that is simply not true. It is a bottom line. No need to even discuss it.”

Under current law, illegal immigrants and legal residents of fewer than five years are mostly barred from receiving benefits under Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for the poor. That restriction does not apply to poor immigrants who show up at hospital emergency rooms, however.

While writing the Affordable Care Act, Congress sidestepped the dicey issue of illegal immigration by excluding immigrants who are in the country illegally from its provisions. That means that those immigrants will not get government subsidies to help them buy private insurance plans, nor can they benefit from the law’s expansion of Medicaid.

At the same time, however, they are exempted from the mandate, taking effect next year, that every person must carry health insurance or face a tax penalty.

Some Republicans think it would be unfair to exclude such immigrants from the insurance mandate. One proposal championed by Labrador, according to people familiar with the private House negotiations, would require illegal immigrants to purchase their own insurance, without access to federal health exchanges, as a prerequisite for citizenship.

Democrats argue that making the immigrants subject to the mandate could impose an insurmountable burden on them because of potentially hefty premiums that would not be offset by federal subsidies available to others. That burden could also discourage people from coming out of the shadows to apply for legal status, said Priscilla Huang, policy director for the nonpartisan Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum.

“If we want them to become citizens and fully integrated into their communities and our country, we should really treat them as such,” Huang said.

Aides said Labrador simply wanted to include language in the House bill that would ensure that illegal immigrants were responsible for paying for their own care.

Other members of the immigration working group resisted out of fear that the language Labrador proposed would have meant that illegal immigrants with unpaid medical bills would not be eligible for permanent legal residency and could be deported, according to Democratic aides.

Jennifer Ng’andu, the director of health policy for the National Council of La Raza, said the true motive for some Republicans is unrelated to immigration reform. Rather, she said, it is to perpetuate “ideological warfare” against the Obama health-care law.

In 2009, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) shouted “You lie!” after Obama said, during his State of the Union address, that immigrants in the country illegally would not be eligible for federal health-care subsidies. Since the Affordable Care Act was narrowly approved a year later, the House GOP has voted to repeal it more than 30 times, symbolic gestures that had no chance of consideration in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

As the Obama administration has moved to sign up uninsured Americans by the October deadline, Republicans have sought to paint a picture of widespread confusion and chaos.

In a video message to constituents Friday, Rubio said that “Obamacare is bad for America” and that the health-care program “can never and will never work and may even contribute to bankrupting our country.”

Last week, Rubio announced he would co-sponsor an amendment with Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) to mandate that illegal immigrants cannot get access to public benefits until five years after they earn green cards signifying permanent legal status.

That would mean that, although such immigrants could be eligible for citizenship after 13 years, they would not be allowed to access the health subsidies for at least 15 years.

“The 13-year-long pathway to citizenship will be hard enough,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). “The restrictions on federal safety-net programs make the pathway even more treacherous.”"

Opponents of the law, which goes into effect Monday, July 8, filed a federal lawsuit challenging it.

The law requires women to undergo an ultrasound before they get an abortion and doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics.

""This bill improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future,"" said Tom Evenson, a spokesman for the governor.

According to Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and Affiliated Medical Services, which are the state's two abortion providers, the law could prompt the closing of abortion clinics in Appleton and Milwaukee because doctors there do not have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.

The two providers filed a lawsuit in Madison federal court on Friday arguing that the law fails to protect the due process and equal protection rights that women who are seeking an abortion have under the Constitution.

Admitting privileges ""won't make women safer and, in fact, could jeopardize their health by depriving women in Wisconsin access to safe, high-quality healthcare,"" said obstetrician-gynecologist Anne Davis in a statement released by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.

The law requires an ultrasound be performed on a pregnant woman at least 24 hours before an abortion, a requirement that can be waived if the pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest.

Results of the ultrasound including images, a description of the fetus and a visualization of the fetal heartbeat must be offered to the woman. The woman can decline the results.

Anti-abortion activists have turned to enacting new restrictions on abortion at the state level after the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing the procedure nationally in Roe v. Wade.

Wisconsin is the third state this week to move toward more restrictions on abortion after a Texas House committee and the North Carolina Senate both approved measures.

On Monday, the battle in Texas over proposed restrictions on abortion resumes with a public hearing in the Senate, where Democrat Wendy Davis staged a filibuster last month to stall the Republican-backed measure.

Wisconsin is one of eight states requiring a doctor to have admitting privileges, but measures in Mississippi and Alabama are blocked in court, according to data published July 1 by the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that supports abortion rights.

Legal challenges are also blocking ultrasound abortion laws in Oklahoma and North Carolina, two of the 12 states with that type of measure in place, the Guttmacher Institute said.

And yet the forced birthers in America have spent the entire four decades since the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision doing everything in their power to prevent women from having access to this legal medical procedure. Today's action by Michigan Republicans is one more cut in their ""death by a thousand cuts"" approach that has included terrorists activities such as bombing abortion clinics and murdering doctors who perform abortions.

It's worth noting that this new law does not just impact insurance provided by state or federal governments. It covers ALL insurance including private insurance. It begs a couple of questions: What are girls under the age of 26 who are their parents' health insurance supposed to do? Also, if you have health insurance through your employer, are you now required to inform them that you want this coverage? This would be a monstrous invasion of medical privacy.

None of this matters to the minority group of forced birthers who believe every pregnancy should end with the birth of a child even if it's the result of a rape or incest. Don't have the means to support a child but have an unplanned pregnancy and can't afford an abortion? That's tough. And you can sure the same legislators that voted for this egregious attack on women's reproductive rights will be there to cut your food stamps and other social safety net programs that will assist your child once it's born.

If a woman has a life-threatening problem with her pregnancy, the difficult choice to have an abortion will come with a doctor's bill to add one more level of pain to an otherwise painful situation, courtesy of Michigan Republicans.

The outrage over this new law is pouring in.

Democratic candidate for governor Mark Schauer:



This bill is a shameful attack on Michigan women. The fact is, this legislation will force Michigan women to pay more for health insurance and limit access to critical health care services for women who have been the victim of a crime. At a time when Michigan has the third worst unemployment rate in the nation, it’s clear that we need new leaders in Lansing who are focused on creating jobs instead of passing bills that hurt Michigan women and families.

Whether a planned pregnancy has gone horribly wrong and a woman needs a medically necessary D & C procedure, or the deplorable and devastating acts of rape or incest have resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, the Senate Republicans’ passage of this cold-hearted rape insurance proposal means Michigan women now have to anticipate the unimaginable and plan to have these unspeakable things happen to them. This is the height of hubris and paternalism that a room full of men have decided they are fit to dictate the terms of Michigan women’s health care, that they can make this decision recklessly without giving a moment’s consideration to the various personal circumstances we women face, and it is an appalling example of political pandering that the Michigan Legislature is bending to the whims of a single high-powered and extreme special interest.

To even claim that women will have the option of abortion insurance under this initiative is deceitful. Michigan is not the first state to take action on this issue; seven other states have already enacted this legislation. In five of these seven states, purchasing an abortion rider is not even an available option. In passing this initiative, we are allowing that 4% of Michigan’s people to dictate the health care options for 100% of Michigan women. For that reason, I firmly believe that this policy must be repealed as an insincere representation of the will of the people.

Even with their own governor being against it, Right to Life went ahead and gave 3 percent of the population the voice for 100 percent of women in Michigan. Legislative Republicans are once again catering to the whims of special interest groups, and the citizens suffer. Now, Michigan woman need to plan ahead for ‘rape insurance’ in case the absolute worst happens.

A woman’s health care decisions should be made by herself, her doctor and her family. Health care decisions are private matters, and special interest groups shouldn’t be allowed to collude with government to intrude upon them.

Republicans have been insisting that the government shouldn’t interfere with insurance company practices, but in this case, that’s exactly what they’re doing. It’s time for the so-called ‘party of small government’ to be exactly that. Republicans need to let the people have the final word on this terrible piece of legislation.

Today it’s official: Michigan Republicans truly view women as second-class citizens. On the one-year anniversary of Right to Work, the Republicans used the same divisive tactics and passed a controversial law that had no committee hearings and no chance for public input. Republicans should be ashamed of bowing down to special interests who have no regard for the well-being of women and not letting Michigan voters decide.”

Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer:Democratic Senator Rebekah Warren:House Democrat Vicki Barnett:House Democrat Marcia Hovey-Wright, Women’s Democratic Caucus Chairwoman:House Democrat Ellen Cogen Lipton:Progress Michigan executive director Lonnie Scott:In what can only be called a near-miracle, the law did not receive ""immediate effect"" in either the Senate or the House and will go into effect in March. Democratic Representative Sarah Roberts has pledged that there will be another indirect initiated state statute to overturn it and put the matter before voters.

If you think there isn't a Republican War on Women, you aren't paying attention. Today, they won another battle in this ongoing war.

Remember this in 2014. That's when we'll all have a chance to replace these hypocritical, drunk-with-power Republicans who want a government so small that it can fit inside a woman's uterus.

The bill, which would require abortion clinics to meet the same safety standards as ambulatory surgical centers, passed the Republican-controlled state Senate last week in a 24-hour span of activity that the state's Republican governor criticized as hurried.

If lawmakers do not pass the new standards before their current session ends, which could be as soon as next week, they will have to wait until January to revisit the issue.

Nine states have similar safety standards on the books.

Texas lawmakers are considering the new standards, which also require a doctor to be present when women take the so-called ""abortion pill,"" even as widespread protests take place at the state Capitol in Austin. On Monday, a judge in Wisconsin temporarily blocked a new law that would require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges in nearby hospitals.

In North Carolina, the safety standards were tacked on to an unrelated bill with no public notice or hearing last week, and quickly pushed through the state Senate.

Opponents celebrated the delay but cautioned that the battle is not over.

""It's a small victory,"" said Democratic State Senator Earline Parmon.

The Senate passage of the safety standards sparked protests and was the focus of a ""Moral Monday"" demonstration that drew an estimated 2,000 people to the capitol building on Monday night.

North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory criticized the Senate for pushing the abortion legislation through in relative secrecy, and House leaders responded by holding a public hearing on Tuesday.

At the hearing, North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Aldona Wos said funding more frequent inspections of abortion clinics might go further in ensuring safety.

Her staff estimated that the measure would raise the cost of building a clinic by about $1 million.

Republican sponsors of the measure said they expect to work on the bill over the next two days, although legislative rules prohibit them from amending the same bill at this stage.

Opponents told lawmakers the changes would take away access to safe and legal abortions for women.

""The majority of North Carolinians want you all to focus on jobs, the economy and increasing access to health care, not stripping away a woman's choices,"" said Suzanne Buckley, Executive Director at NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina.

But supporters, mostly Republicans, said the higher standards will increase safety.

""We're not here to take away the rights of women,"" said North Carolina state Senator Warren Daniel, a Republican who helped push the Senate legislation toward passage. ""We're taking away the right of an industry to operate health clinics under substandard conditions."" (Editing By Karen Brooks and Bernard Orr)"

The drama centered largely around Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, who staged an hours-long, old-fashioned filibuster on the Senate floor against a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans initially succeeded in cutting her filibuster off, in part by objecting when another lawmaker helped her with a back brace. But protesters picked up where she left off, jeering at lawmakers as they rushed to meet a midnight deadline for the bill.

Republicans initially insisted they made it, but Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst later acknowledged they did not.

Dewhurst denounced the more than 400 protesters who staged what they called ""a people's filibuster"" from 11:45 p.m. to well past midnight. He denied mishandling the debate.

""I didn't lose control (of the chamber). We had an unruly mob,"" Dewhurst said. He then hinted that Gov. Rick Perry may immediately call another special session, adding: ""It's over. It's been fun. But see you soon.""

The chaos capped one of the most unusual stand-offs in any state legislative session this year.

Davis spent most of the day staging her filibuster, attracting wide support, including a mention from President Obama's campaign Twitter account. Her Twitter following went from 1,200 in the morning to more than 20,000 by Tuesday night.

""My back hurts. I don't have a lot of words left,"" Davis said when it was over and she was showered with cheers by activist who stayed at the Capitol to see her. ""It shows the determination and spirit of Texas women.""

Davis' mission, however, was cut short.

Rules stipulated she remain standing, not lean on her desk or take any breaks -- even for meals or to use the bathroom. But she also was required to stay on topic, and Republicans pointed out a mistake and later protested again when another lawmaker helped her with a back brace.

Republican Sen. Donna Campbell called the third point of order because of her remarks about a previous law concerning sonograms. Under the rules, lawmakers can vote to end a filibuster after three sustained points of order.

After much back and forth, the GOP voted to end the filibuster minutes before midnight, sparking the raucous response from protesters in the final 15 minutes before the deadline.

Initially, Republicans insisted they had started voting before the midnight deadline and passed the bill that Democrats spent much of Tuesday filibustering. But after official computer records and printouts of the voting record showed the vote took place on Wednesday, and then were changed to read Tuesday, senators convened for a private meeting.

An hour later, Dewhurst was still insisting the 19-10 vote was in time, but said, ""with all the ruckus and noise going on, I couldn't sign the bill.""

The measures would have closed almost every abortion clinic in Texas, a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long with 26 million people. A woman living along the Mexico border or in West Texas would have to drive hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion if the law passes.

In her opening remarks, Davis said she was ""rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans"" and called Republican efforts to pass the bill a ""raw abuse of power.""

""Partisanship and ambition are not unusual in a state capitol but here in Texas right now it has risen to a level of profound irresponsibility,"" Davis was quoted as saying by MyFoxAustin.com.

Democrats chose Davis to lead the effort because of her background as a woman who had her first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School.

In the hallway outside the Senate chamber, hundreds of women stood in line, waiting for people in the gallery to give up their seats. Women's rights supporters wore orange T-shirts to show their support for Davis, and Dewhurst reminded those in the gallery that interrupting the proceedings could results in 48 hours in jail.

Davis tried to stay comfortable and sharp by shifting her weight from hip to hip and slowly walking around her desk while reading notes from a large binder on her desk.

MyFoxAustin.com reported that a protester in the Senate gallery, identified as Mike Bradford, was removed by security after causing a disturbance.

He explained his opposition to abortion in an interview with reporters outside the gallery.

""I see all the supporters mostly I see, firstly white women, who are supporting abortion but yet abortions are effecting a certain demographic that's not included in the people supporting it,"" Bradford told the station.

Twice in the first six hours, anti-abortion lawmakers questioned Davis about the bill, presenting their arguments that it would protect women or that abortions were wrong. Davis answered their questions but did not give up control of the floor.

""This is really about women's health,"" said Sen. Bob Deuell, who introduced a requirement that all abortions take place in surgical centers. ""Sometimes bad things can happen.""

Davis questioned then why vasectomies and colonoscopies aren't also required to take place in such clinics. ""Because I've been unable to have a simple question answered to help me understand how this would lead to better care for women, I must question the underlying motive for doing so.""

Davis read testimony from women and doctors who would be impacted by the changes, but who were denied the opportunity to speak in a Republican-controlled committee. During one heart-wrenching story describing a woman's difficult pregnancy, Davis choked up several times and wiped tears.

The bill would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy and force many clinics that perform the procedure to upgrade their facilities and be classified as ambulatory surgical centers. Also, doctors would be required to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles -- a tall order in rural communities.

The historic vote, 57-35, allows the amendment to be referred to North Dakota citizens for a vote.

According to SCR 4009, “the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and protected.”

Heraldonline.com reports that the amendment was written to ensure that both mother and baby are treated as medical patients, that medical care is not inhibited, and that fertility treatments are not banned.

LifeSiteNews.com reports that every major pro-life organization in North Dakota has supported SCR 4009.

“The North Dakota legislature has taken historic strides to protect every human being in the state, paving the way for human rights nationwide,” said Keith Mason, president of Personhood USA.

Mason added:

This amendment strikes the balance of accomplishing more for the unborn than any other amendment the nation has ever seen, while protecting pregnant women and their right to true medical care. We applaud the North Dakota House and Senate for their willingness to protect all of the people in their state.

“The North Dakota personhood amendment takes the pro-life plank of the GOP platform and puts it into practice,” said Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D., legal analyst for Personhood USA. “Furthermore, it allows the legislature the needed flexibility to implement the specific protections of the right to life through future legislation.”

The state House also passed two other pro-life bills, one that demands that abortion doctors have admitting privileges to hospitals (SB 2305), and another that places a ban on abortions past 20 weeks and also bans taxpayer funding from going to organizations that provide abortions (SB 2368).

Last week, the state legislature also passed a “heartbeat bill,” which could ban abortions as early as six weeks, and a ban on abortions for genetic conditions such as Down’s Syndrome.

The bills will now go to Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) for his signature. Paul Maloney, executive director of North Dakota Right to Life told LifeSiteNews.com that his group has “always had faith” in Dalrymple and expects him to sign the bills.

“I’m extremely proud of my state for the statement that they’ve made to the country,” Maloney said. “I guess it’s in the hands of the courts.” Maloney’s statement referenced the reality that the bills will almost certainly be subject to legal challenges.

“We applaud North Dakota for defending life,” said Concerned Women for America CEO and President Penny Nance. “The bills in North Dakota protect the lives of the most innocent Americans, those without a voice, in the womb.”

Nance added, “Hopefully these bills will start a national discussion about what life is and our duty as a civil society to protect it. It starts in the states.”"

Justice Sotomayor blocked the implementation of the mandate

Sotomayor acted on a request from an order of Catholic nuns in Colorado

Portions of the Affordable Care Act go into effect Jan. 1

WASHINGTON (AP) — Only hours before the law was to take effect, a Supreme Court justice on Tuesday blocked implementation of part of President Obama's health care law that would have forced some religion-affiliated organizations to provide health insurance for employees that includes birth control coverage.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor's decision came after a different effort by Catholic-affiliated groups from around the U.S. Those groups had rushed to the federal courts to stop Wednesday's start of portions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Sotomayor acted on a request from an organization of Catholic nuns in Denver, the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged. Its request for an emergency stay had been denied earlier in the day by a federal appeals court.

The government is ""temporarily enjoined from enforcing against applicants the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" Sotomayor said in the order. She gave government officials until 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) Friday to respond to her order.

The law requires employers to provide insurance that covers a range of preventive care, free of charge, including contraception. The Catholic Church prohibits the use of contraceptives. That was not acceptable, said the nuns' lawyer, Mark L. Rienzi.

""The Little Sisters are an order of Catholic nuns whose religious faith leads them to devote their lives to caring for the elderly poor. Not surprisingly, they have sincere and undisputed religious objections to complying with this Mandate,"" Rienzi said.

The Obama administration crafted a compromise, or accommodation, that attempted to create a buffer for religiously affiliated hospitals, universities and social service groups that oppose birth control. The law requires insurers or the health plan's outside administrator to pay for birth control coverage and creates a way to reimburse them.

But for that to work, the nuns would have to sign a form authorizing their insurance company to provide contraceptive coverage, which would still violate their beliefs, he said.

""Without an emergency injunction, Mother Provincial Loraine Marie Maguire has to decide between two courses of action: (a) sign and submit a self-certification form, thereby violating her religious beliefs; or (b) refuse to sign the form and pay ruinous fines,"" he said.

The White House did not comment on the order Tuesday night. Sotomayor issued the order a few hours before leading the final 60-second countdown and pushing the ceremonial button to drop the New Year's Eve ball in New York's Times Square.

A spokeswoman for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the lead counsel for the Little Sisters of the Poor, said the group was delighted by Sotomayor's order. ""The government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people,"" Emily Hardman said in a statement. ""It doesn't need to force nuns to participate.""

Sotomayor's decision to delay the contraceptive portion of the law was joined by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also issued an emergency stay for Catholic-affiliated groups challenging the contraceptive provision. But one judge on the three-judge panel that made the decision, Judge David S. Tatel, said he would have denied their motion.

""Because I believe that appellants are unlikely to prevail on their claim that the challenged provision imposes a 'substantial burden' under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, I would deny their application for an injunction pending appeal,"" Tatel said."

Rosa DeLauro decrying it as a ""death knell of the food stamp program.""

After weeks of pitched battle on Capitol Hill and in the media, the U.S. House of Representatives finally passed a farm bill on Thursday. The latest incarnation of the bill, which narrowly passed with zero Democratic votes, includes no provisions related to funding for SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps).

Since 1977, every incarnation of the farm bill—which subsidizes and regulate various programs related to agriculture and food production—has included food stamp funding. House leadership decided to carve SNAP out of the 2013 farm bill and place it in a separate piece of legislation after Democrats blocked an earlier version of the law which would have cut about $20.5 billion out of SNAP over the next decade.

Now that Republicans have successfully passed a version of the farm bill without SNAP funding, they will likely introduce a separate food stamp bill which is expected to include even deeper cuts than the $20.5 billion originally proposed. Several Republicans defected on the original farm bill because they did not consider the cuts to food stamps deep enough; House leadership will likely design the separate food stamps bill with placating those members in mind.

The farm bill vote was preceded by a vicious floor debate. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said the revised farm bill would be “the death knell of the food stamp program.”

“A vote for this bill is a vote to end nutrition programs in America,” she said. She also accused the Republican House leadership of violating its own rules by bringing the new bill to a vote fewer than three days after it had been introduced.

“I would have said it’s one of the worst things you’ve done, but there’s such stiff competition for that honor,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Republicans framed the debate in bloodless terms, saying that separating food stamps from agricultural policy was the logical thing to do. Rules committee chair Pete Session, R-Texas, said the new version of the bill “excludes some extraneous provisions,” a statement that drew outrage from his Democratic colleagues.

“These people are not extraneous,” said DeLauro of food stamp recipients.

The White House has threatened a veto of the House bill. It will now proceed to conference committee, where it will be merged with a Senate farm bill that includes some $4 billion in food stamp cuts."
http://news.yahoo.com/appeals-court-nycs-big-soda-161314895.html,,[],Appeals court: NYC's big-soda ban unconstitutional,"NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's crackdown on big, sugary sodas is staying on ice.

A mid-level state appeals court ruled Tuesday that the city's Board of Health exceeded its legal authority when it voted last year to put a 16-ounce size limit on high-calorie soft drinks served in restaurants, theaters, stadiums, sidewalk food carts and many other places.

In a unanimous opinion, a four-judge panel of the state Supreme Court Appellate Division said that while the board has the power to ban ""inherently harmful"" foodstuffs from being served to the public, sweetened beverages don't fall into that category. Soda consumption is not necessarily harmful when done in moderation, the court wrote, and therefore ""cannot be classified as a health hazard per se.""

The panel didn't address whether the size limit would have infringed on personal liberties, but said that in adopting it, the health board improperly assumed broad lawmaking powers given only to legislative bodies, like the City Council.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the driving force behind the regulation, promised a quick appeal.

""Today's decision is a temporary setback, and we plan to appeal this decision as we continue the fight against the obesity epidemic,"" he said in a statement.

The American Beverage Association, which had been among the groups challenging the rule, applauded the ruling, which was the second to find that the Board of Health had overstepped its authority. A similar lower court ruling in March kept the regulation from taking effect.

""With this ruling behind us, we look forward to collaborating with city leaders on solutions that will have a meaningful and lasting impact on the people of New York City,"" said Beverage Association spokesman Christopher Gindlesperger.

New York's effort to cap soda portions has drawn praise from health experts lauding it as a groundbreaking step in America's war on extra weight and ridicule from late-night TV hosts ribbing the mayor as a nutrition nanny.

Story continues

The drinks limit follows other Bloomberg efforts to nudge New Yorkers into better diets. His administration has forced chain restaurants to post calorie counts on menus, barred artificial trans fats from restaurant fare and challenged food manufacturers to use less salt.

Bloomberg and city Health Commissioner Thomas Farley saw soft drinks as a sensible next front in a necessary fight: reining in an obesity rate that rose from 18 to 24 percent of adults in the city within a decade. Studies have tied heavy consumption of sugary drinks to weight gain. A 20-ounce Coke packs more calories than a McDonald's hamburger. Diabetes, linked to excessive sugar intake, is now among the leading causes of death in New York.

Bloomberg leaves office at the end of the year, and it is unclear whether his successor will continue the legal fight. Only one candidate, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, supports the ban. City Council President Christine Quinn, another candidate, has said she believes the city has the right to impose the ban, but wouldn't have done it herself. All the other leading candidates oppose it.

Many city residents view the drink limits as well-intentioned but too big of a reach into private conduct.

""Obesity is a big problem in our society, and that's where all the impetus for this comes from,"" said Francesca Delavega, 26, who moved to the city three years ago from Minnesota. ""But I think people in New York also like being able to do whatever they want. And that's kind of one of the things we're known for.""

Writing for the appeals panel, Justice Dianne T. Renwick did leave a slight crack in the door for some type of restriction on beverage sizes.

Nothing in the decision, she wrote, is intended to ""express an opinion on the wisdom of the soda consumption restrictions, provided that they are enacted by the government body with the authority to do so.""

Jerry Brown to immediately begin freeing state inmates and waived state laws to allow early releases, threatening the governor with contempt if he does not comply.

Citing California’s “defiance,” “intransigence” and “deliberate failure” to provide inmates with adequate care in its overcrowded lockups, the judges on Thursday said Brown must shed 9,600 inmates —about 8% of the prison population — by the end of the year.

Unless he finds another way to ease crowding, the governor must expand the credits that inmates can earn for good behavior or participation in rehabilitation programs, the judges said.

“We are willing to defer to their choice for how to comply with our order, not whether to comply with it,” the judges wrote. “Defendants have consistently sought to frustrate every attempt by this court to achieve a resolution to the overcrowding problem.”

If Sacramento does not meet the inmate cap on time, the judges said, it will have to release prisoners from a list of “low risk” offenders the court has told the administration to prepare.

Brown had already taken steps to appeal the court-imposed cap to the U.S. Supreme Court, and he vowed to fight the latest ruling as well.

“The state will seek an immediate stay of this unprecedented order to release almost 10,000 inmates by the end of this year,” he said in a statement.

He had immediate backing from the California Police Chiefs Assn. The court order shows “a complete disregard for the safety of communities across California,” said the group’s president, Covina Police Chief Kim Raney.

“Pressing for 9,000 more inmates on the streets,” Raney said, shows “an activist court more concerned with prisoners than the safety of the communities.”

But a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it did not expect to have to contend with a flood of ex-convicts to watch over.

“It is never a positive step when prisoners have to be released,” said spokesman Steve Whitmore, “but the Sheriff’s Department is prepared for this eventuality.”

Brown has until July 13 to file his full appeal with the high court, the same body that two years ago upheld findings that California prison conditions violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

Lawyers for inmates, meanwhile, said Brown has few options but to let some prisoners go.

“At this point, the governor is an inch away from contempt,” said Don Specter, lead attorney for the Prison Law Office, which in 2001 filed one of two lawsuits on which the judges based their order. “He must make every effort to comply immediately.”

In May, Brown told the court under protest that he could further trim the prison population by continuing to use firefighting camps and privately owned facilities to house state inmates, and by leasing space in Los Angeles and Alameda county jails. In that plan, increasing the time off that inmates may earn for good behavior would have had little impact.

Thursday’s order requires, absent other solutions, that the state give minimum-custody inmates two days off for every one served without trouble and to apply those credits retroactively. Such a step could spur the release of as many as 5,385 prisoners by the end of December.

A separate lawsuit, dating to 1990, alleges unconstitutionally cruel treatment of mentally ill inmates. That the courts are still trying, after two decades, to fix prison conditions was not lost on the three-judge panel that oversees prison crowding, U.S. District Judges Lawrence Karlton and Thelton Henderson and U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Reinhardt.

Their order accuses the state of “a series of contumacious actions” and challenges Brown’s sincerity about obeying their orders. They noted that the governor lifted an emergency proclamation that allowed inmates to be transferred to prisons in other states, for example.

Advertisement

Requests from prison lawyers that the administration be held in contempt “have considerable merit,” the judges wrote.

The governor’s reluctance to set prisoners free early has the backing of legislative leaders, including Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). He joked openly on Wednesday about intending to kill any population-reduction plans the courts might order the governor to submit to the Legislature.

Republicans in the Legislature have pushed a plan to resume prison expansion in California.

In April, they urged Brown to restore borrowing authority that would have allowed 13,000 beds to be added. They also asked that he continue to pay to house some prisoners in private facilities in the interim. Brown did not include such provisions in the budget that is now on his desk.

Advertisement

The judges said there could be no delays in compliance with their order for appeals or for amendments to the plan Brown submitted in May.

They rejected state officials’ assertion that “with more time, they could resolve the problem.”

Advertisement

California voters may be more willing than Brown to release inmates to reduce crowding. In a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, they were wary of sacrificing public safety, but at the same time supported steps to reduce crowding.

Sixty-three percent said they favored releasing low-level, nonviolent offenders from prison early.

An analysis by The New York Times shows the cost of premiums for people who just miss qualifying for subsidies varies widely across the country and rises rapidly for people in their 50s and 60s. In some places, prices can quickly approach 20 percent of a person’s income. Experts consider health insurance unaffordable once it exceeds 10 percent of annual income. By that measure, a 50-year-old making $50,000 a year, or just above the qualifying limit for assistance, would find the cheapest available plan to be unaffordable in more than 170 counties around the country, ranging from Anchorage to Jackson, Miss.

The Jews have an expression: he who saves a life saves the whole world. I sometimes think that we could use a few more scoundrels. We could use a few more people who are notorious sinners—if, in fact, they would intervene on behalf of human life. I ask you, who is the most righteous? Is it the person who sings the loudest, who prays the longest? Is it the person who has memorized the most Bible verses, but never lifts a finger to intervene on behalf of another human being's life or death? Or is the person who maybe has a lifestyle that is less than desirable, but who, when it really counts, is willing to stand between life and death for other human beings?

Let us pause for this brief reminder of Huckabee's own words:

Okay, then, let's continue:



And now we're called into this incredible holocaust of our own in America. Fifty-five million babies. Fifty-five million babies since 1973 have died in what ought to be the safest place in the world: their mothers' womb. And it's become one of the most dangerous places for a baby to be. For us, this is not about the politics of Democrat and Republican, winning and losing. It's about our capacity to one day stand before a holy god and give an account for whether we stood between life and death for those who had no voice but ours, who had no hands to raise and say ""no"" except ours.

The report, titled ""Deadly Delivery,"" notes that the likelihood of a woman's dying in childbirth in the U.S. is ﬁve times as great as in Greece, four times as great as in Germany and three times as great as in Spain. Every day in the U.S., more than two women die of pregnancy-related causes, with the maternal mortality ratio doubling from 6.6 deaths per 100,000 births in 1987 to 13.3 deaths per 100,000 births in 2006.

I want to mention today that the heart of the pro-life movement is not about trying to end abortion as much as it is to try to help people understand that abortion ends when we elevate every human life as a life of value. And the ultimate goal, and the message that we must articulate, is there is no such thing as a life that is expendable, disposable and unworthy of being treated with dignity and respect. Our founders said it eloquently in the Declaration of Independence. ""We hold these things, these truths, to be self-evident. That all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" It is not the government who has the right to determine the value of our life or the nature of our death.

And our founders recognized this—though they didn't get it all right, they understood that all of us have a sense of equality because our equality comes from the fact that we have our roots and our origins, not merely by human hands, but that our creation is the result of a divine intervention. And they saw it that way. We're all created equal. Endowed by our creator with those unalienable rights. It is not the job of government to give life or to decide who gets to take it. It is the job of government to protect that which God has given us responsibility for, and in the case of an unborn child, it is the life of those most vulnerable that it is our duty to protect and to seek to preserve.

Now, we've spent, for the last 40 years in this country, since Roe v. Wade, we've taught the idea that life can be expendable if the life represents a social disruption or a financial hardship on the biological mother. I mean, that's the basis of abortion on demand. Well, I can't really carry this baby because I'd have to drop out of college. I can't carry the baby because it would cost me a promotion at work. I can't carry the baby because my mother would be furious at me if she finds out I'm pregnant. My father will never understand this. So for the purpose of our social disruptions, or sometimes for financial hardships, I can't afford the baby.

I understand the hardship, but I think we've got to be very careful never to be condemning of that young lady in the most painful and difficult moment of her life. I'm so grateful for what Marla said here today. It was beautiful, absolutely beautiful, and her own story is a powerful one. The story of a frightened young girl having to make a very tough decision, and in her case, making the right one. And we shouldn't be condemning of those who make a different one. We should reach out to them with the same message of grace and redemption, but never waiver from our message that life is precious.

Now think about if we instill, as we have in this culture of ours, the notion that life is disposable if it represents financial hardships or social disruptions. Here's what we've told the generation coming after us, the generation of my children and now my grandchildren. We've told them that if they were expendable at that end of the spectrum of life because they just were going to be too expensive, or because they represented for us having to mess up our calendars, then we have now told them that at the other end of the spectrum of life, when they become our caretakers, we've already now given them permission. In fact, we have given them full rights to end our lives, because I guarantee you, at that end of the spectrum, we will be a financial hardship to them, and we will represent a social disruption when they have to give up their weekends to come check on us in the long-term care center, and when they have to write the check every month for all of that expensive care that we're going to end up costing.

Now, I don't know about you, but I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to make it much tougher for my kids to get rid of me than that. I'm telling you now, I am not going to go easily.

And now for a little fact-checking interruption about why wombs are no safe haven. In 2010, Amnesty International released a report about the ""maternal health crisis"" in America:The report also found that ""one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care,"" and that the majority of those deaths were easily preventable with improved access to affordable health care. Those unborn children, for whom Huckabee claims to be so concerned, are denied basic and necessary care even before they're born. That is what makes wombs so dangerous—and it has nothing to do with abortion.Remember:While Huckabee and his fellow conservatives may claim to believe it is the government's job to protect the unborn, they don't think the government has any business doing a damned thing for the born. That's why conservatives have fought against the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, early childhood education, nutritional assistance programs, child labor laws—basically anything that protects and provides for children—because of empty catch-phrases like ""free market"" and ""self-reliance"" and ""bootstraps.""While Huckabee so easily and dismissively scoffs at the reasons why women might want to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, there's one young woman's name he should learn : Spring Adams, who died at the age of 13, when her father, who had raped and impregnated her, shot and killed her in her sleep after finding out she planned to obtain an abortion.It's almost impressive the way Huckabee first ridicules and condemns the reasons women might choose an abortion, and then, in the very next breath, insists that these women should not be condemned—and then, in the breath after that, continues to condemn them for making what he considers the ""wrong"" choice. This is what passes for his ""message of grace.""It's curious, to say the least, that Huckabee is concerned that his children and grandchildren might prefer to off him rather than write out those expensive checks to the nursing home. But if his concern is genuine—which, you can be sure from his laughter, it isn't—he might want to have a conversation with his own Republican Party. It's his party, after all, that is so eager to cut or eliminate entirely the very programs, like Social Security and Medicare and even Meals on Wheels, that would ease the financial burden of caring for Huckabee in his old age. But conservatives don't believe in preserving that social safety net; after all, the government only has an obligation to protect and provide for you while you're still in the womb. After that, you're on your own.And then the room fills with laughter. Oh, what a wonderful speech. Oh, what a charming man. Oh, what a great voice for a movement that believes it is better to let women die than spend a single government dollar on their health care or the health care of their children once they are born. Toss in some basic shaming of the choices women make, an outrageous comparison to genocide, and voila. There's your ""pro-life"" movement, neatly summed up by one of its most charismatic leaders, because every single life has value, and ""it is not the government who has the right to determine the value of our life or the nature of our death.""

Just remember:



I actually carried out the death penalty 16 times more than any governor in my state's history."

BISMARCK, N.D. -- A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked a new North Dakota law that bans abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected – as early as six weeks into pregnancy, calling the law ""clearly invalid and unconstitutional.""

U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland in Bismarck granted a temporary injunction Monday that blocks the Aug. 1 enactment of the law that abortion rights advocates call the most restrictive in the nation.

""There is no question that (the North Dakota law) is in direct contradiction to a litany of United States Supreme Court cases addressing restraints on abortion,"" Hovland wrote. "" (It) is clearly an invalid and unconstitutional law based on the United States Supreme Court precedent in Roe v. Wade from 1973 ... and the progeny of cases that have followed.""

""We have our job to do,"" Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem told The Associated Press. ""We need to convince (Hovland) why the Legislature wanted to enact the law.""

Stenehjem said the state will ask the court for a trial and already has hired an attorney to help argue the case.

New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the state's lone abortion clinic, Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, filed the lawsuit in June after the law was passed this year by the North Dakota Legislature. It would outlaw the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before some women even know they are pregnant.

Abortion-rights advocates say the measures are an attempt to close North Dakota's lone abortion clinic. Supporters of the so-called fetal heartbeat measure, including Gov. Jack Dalrymple, have said it's a challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion up until a fetus is considered viable, usually at 22 to 24 weeks.

Janet Crepps, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the law banning abortions at six weeks ""poses a very immediate threat to virtually all women seeking an abortion in North Dakota.""

Red River director Tammi Kromenaker and Crepps said the six-week abortion ban would stop about 90 percent of abortions at the clinic.

""This ruling means that women won't have to rush in and make a decision,"" Kromenaker said of the injunction. ""Now they have more time to talk to their loved one, their pastor – whoever they need to talk to – while weighing their decision to have an abortion.""

Jeff Zent, a spokesman for Dalrymple, said the governor would not comment on the federal judge's ruling.

""It's our standing policy not to comment on litigation,"" he said.

The clinic's lawsuit also is challenging another new measure that would make North Dakota the only state to prohibit women from having an abortion because a fetus has a genetic defect, such as Down syndrome.

Kromenaker said the clinic wants that law overturned but didn't seek an immediate injunction to block it because abortions are not performed there for that reason.

The clinic is not challenging another new North Dakota law that would outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain by then. Texas Gov. Rick Perry last week signed into law a 20-week ban and other abortion restrictions for that state.

Kromenaker said the 20-week ban, which she believes is unconstitutional, does not apply to North Dakota because no abortions are performed at the clinic after 16 weeks.

Another measure would require a doctor who performs abortions to be a physician with hospital admitting privileges. A lawsuit challenging that law has been combined with another one challenging a 2011 North Dakota law that outlaws one of two drugs used in nonsurgical abortions. A state judge ruled last week that the 2011 law violates the state and U.S. constitutions. A judge hasn't yet issued a ruling on the new law requiring abortion doctors to have hospital admitting privileges.

The bill bans abortions after 20 weeks

Protesters loudly sang%2C %27Give choice a chance%27

Gov. Rick Perry has said he intends to sign the bill into law

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Republicans in the Texas Legislature passed an omnibus abortion bill that is one of the most restrictive in the nation, but Democrats vowed Saturday to fight both in the courts and the ballot box as they used the measure to rally their supporters.

More than 2,000 demonstrators filled the Capitol building in Austin to oppose the bill, and state troopers drug six out of the Senate chamber for trying to disrupt the debate. The Republican majority ultimately passed the bill unchanged just before midnight, with all but one Democrat voting against it.

""Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life,"" said Gov. Rick Perry who will sign the bill into law in the next few days. ""This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women's health.""

Democrats, though, promised a fight in the courts.

""There will be a lawsuit. I promise you,"" Dallas Sen. Royce West said on the Senate floor, raising his right hand as if taking an oath.

Democrats offered 20 amendments to the bill, which will ban abortions after 20 weeks, require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and require all abortions take place in surgical centers. They ranged from exceptions for rape and incest to allowing doctors more leeway in prescribing abortion-inducing drugs. But Republicans would have none of it.

The bill is just one of many across the nation championed by anti-abortion groups set on a constitutional challenge to Roe vs Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a woman's right to decide on an abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb.

Texas falls under the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has shown a willingness to accept more stringent limits on abortions. Passing the law also pleases Christian conservatives who make up the majority of Republican primary voters.

But the measure has also sparked protests in Texas not seen in least 20 years, with thousands of abortion rights supporters flooding the Capitol to draw out normally boring committee hearings and disrupting key votes. Protesters finished a filibuster started by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth by jeering for the last 15 minutes of the first special session, effectively killing the bill.

That's when Perry called lawmakers back for round two. But opponents said the fight is far from over and used the popular anger to register and organize Democratic voters.

""Let's make sure that tonight is not an ending point, it's a beginning point for our future, our collective futures, as we work to take this state back."" Davis told 2,000 adoring supporters after the bill passed.

The Texas Republican Party, meanwhile, celebrated what they considered a major victory that makes Texas ""a nationwide leader in pro-life legislation.""

""As Democrats continue to talk about their dreams of turning Texas blue, passage of HB2 is proof that Texans are conservative and organized and we look forward to working with our amazing Republican leadership in the Texas Legislature as they finish the special session strong,"" a party statement said.

Friday's debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators, with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Security was tight, and state troopers reported confiscating bottles of urine and feces as they worked to prevent another attempt to stop the Republican majority from passing the proposal.

Those arrested or removed from the chamber included four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery while singing, ""All we are saying is give choice a chance."" One of the women was successful in chaining herself, prompting a 10-minute recess.

Sen. Glen Hegar of Katy, the bill's Republican author, argued that all abortions, including those induced with medications, should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications.

Democrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home.

Cecile Richards, the daughter of former Gov. Anne Richards and president of Planned Parenthood, said Texas Republicans and abortion opponents won this political round — but it could cost them down the road.

""All they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women's health care away,"" she said.

The dedication of those activists will be tested during the 2014 elections. Democrats have not won a statewide seat in Texas since 1994, the longest such losing streak in the nation."
http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/22/judge-blocks-north-dakotas-restrictive-abortion-law/,2013-07-22 00:00:00,"['Tampa Tim', 'Rudy Nyc', 'The', 'Compassionate', 'Gop Solution', 'Posted By']",Judge blocks North Dakota's restrictive abortion law,"8 years ago

(CNN) - One of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. was temporarily blocked from enforcement after a federal judge said Monday that North Dakota's pre-viability provisions were ""invalid and unconstitutional.""

The state legislature had passed a law that would ban an abortion when a fetal heartbeat was detected–sometimes as early as six weeks into pregnancy. The legislation was set to go into effect August 1, but Judge Daniel Hovland granted a temporary injunction, after a Fargo women's clinic filed a lawsuit last month.



The judge noted that the law would ban 90% of abortions performed at Red River Women's Clinic, North Dakota's only clinic that performs abortions. While proponents say the law enhances medical safety for women in the state, opponents argue it makes it nearly impossible for women to have an abortion.

In his decision, the judge said ""there is no question"" that the law known as HB 1456 directly contradicts a ""litany"" of Supreme Court cases that address restraints on abortion, including Roe v. Wade.

""The State of North Dakota has presented no evidence to justify the passage of this troubling law,"" he wrote. ""The State has extended an invitation to an expensive court battle over a law restricting abortions that is a blatant violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all women.""

With the law, North Dakota would have had the strictest limit in the country. A number of states have passed abortion bans after 20 weeks, such as Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Indiana and Alabama. Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 12 weeks.

Some states have no time limit, while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester, about 27 or 28 weeks into the pregnancy.

""I respect the attention Judge Hovland has given to this case,"" said North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem on Monday. ""It is also important to remember that courts routinely grant preliminary injunctions in these types of cases, so this was not unusual or unexpected. This is an early stage of the proceeding. As it is the constitutional duty of the Attorney General to defend legislation enacted by the North Dakota Legislature, we will continue to defend the challenged statutes through the established legal process.""

Abortion rights groups hailed the judge's order.

""The nation's most extreme abortion ban has been blocked, and the message to hostile politicians could not be clearer: the rights of women guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution and protected by 40 years of Supreme Court precedent cannot be legislated away,"" said Bebe Anderson of Center for Reproductive Rights, which helped bring the lawsuit. ""Today's decision ensures for the moment that the women of North Dakota won't need to worry whether they will still have the same constitutionally protected rights as women living in other parts of the United States.""

Sarah Stoesz, the president of the regional chapter of Planned Parenthood, wrote the ruling ""means that women throughout the state will have access to safe and legal abortion while the state continues to pursue its attack on women’s health in the courts.”

Proponents of the North Dakota bill anticipated the law would be challenged in the courts shortly after the legislation passed back in March.

When signing the bill, Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple acknowledged the law had a tough road ahead.

""Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade,"" the governor said in a statement, directing the legislature to set aside funds to cover the cost of the expected legal battle.

The state now has the option of asking a federal appeals court in St. Louis to step in and allow the law to go into effect while the court challenges continue, a process that could take several months. An eventual appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is a possibility.

The law would have targeted doctors rather than women having an abortion, with a maximum punishment of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Doctors, if convicted, could also lose their license to practice medicine. Women who have the abortion may not be prosecuted.

While the law does not rule out abortions when a medical emergency threatens the life of a woman, it does not allow for an abortion in the case of rape or incest.

Abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state.

For the justices, Roe reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy. That ""right,"" wrote Justice Harry Blackmun in the main opinion for the court, is ""broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.""

But the ruling was a qualified one, and that fact has been used by abortion opponents over the decades in their efforts to narrow the scope of other abortion provisions. Some activists have said they hope restrictions like those imposed by North Dakota would lead to a fundamental rethinking of access to abortion by the Supreme Court in coming years.

The ""qualified right"" established by the high court found its form in the controversial ""trimester analysis"" laid out by the justices in Roe: permitting no government regulation during the first three months of a pregnancy; allowing limited regulation in the second trimester to protect the woman's health and safety; and granting government the power to ban abortions during the third trimester - a time when, medical consensus has concluded, the fetus is capable of living on its own.

USA TODAY

Health care law says most companies must cover birth control

Owners of corporations object based on their religious beliefs

Legal fight for Obama comes on top of legislative%2C political battles

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court added a new legal challenge Tuesday to the legislative and political battles raging over President Obama's embattled health care law.

The justices agreed to consider whether for-profit corporations whose owners oppose abortion on religious grounds must abide by the law's mandate that health insurance policies include free coverage of government-approved forms of contraception.

It's the first legal challenge to reach the high court since it upheld the law 17 months ago in a 5-4 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts. While a loss for the government wouldn't strike down the law itself, conservatives still seething over Roberts' rescue of Obamacare say the case offers Roberts an initial chance to rule against it.

Beyond its attachment to the health care law, however, the legal challenge is significant in its own right because it will answer a fundamental question with far-reaching consequences: Can corporations pray? Until now, no court has granted religious rights under the First Amendment's ""free exercise clause"" to for-profit businesses.

The corporations whose lawsuits were chosen over some 40 others say, in essence, that they do pray. The cases were filed by Hobby Lobby, a chain of more than 500 arts-and-crafts stores with about 13,000 full-time employees, and Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Lancaster, Pa., woodworking business run by a Mennonite family.

Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma City-based company founded by David Green in 1970, closes on Sundays and funnels millions of dollars in profits to ministries. Its website proclaims its commitment to ""honoring the Lord in all we do by operating the company in a manner consistent with biblical principles.""

To avoid promoting alcohol, for instance, Hobby Lobby doesn't sell shot glasses. And to avoid promoting abortion, it doesn't cover drugs or devices which it claims are capable of terminating a pregnancy, including the after-sex drugs Plan B and Ella and two types of intrauterine devices. The government and abortion rights groups say those drugs and devices only postpone ovulation.

Norman and Elizabeth Hahn operate Conestoga Wood with their three sons, and they ""integrate their faith into their daily lives, including their work,"" says their brief to the high court.

""Both cases represent a broad diversity in which families in America practice their faith as they try to earn a living, all the way from Mennonites making wood cabinets to the Green family operating a chain store,"" said Matt Bowman of Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing Conestoga.

The health care law says companies with 50 or more workers that offer health insurance must cover contraceptives as part of a preventive care package for women. Churches and other houses of worship were excluded from the mandate, and some religious institutions, such as universities, were allowed to have insurers offer the benefit directly.

""We believe this requirement is lawful and essential to women's health and are confident the Supreme Court will agree,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""These steps protect both women's health and religious beliefs, and seek to ensure that women and families — not their bosses or corporate CEOs — can make personal health decisions based on their needs and their budgets.""

The law's defenders say the exclusions should not extend to corporations like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood. ""Corporations don't pray … they don't have a religious conscience,"" says David Gans of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal law firm and advocacy group. ""These are all human attributes that don't apply to corporations.""

Combined with smaller companies and those who did not change their insurance plans since the law was implemented, up to one-third of Americans are covered by exempt plans. But larger for-profit corporations must comply or face fines of $100 per day per employee, which could total $475 million a year in Hobby Lobby's case. An alternative -- dropping employee health insurance altogether -- would cost $26 million in annual penalties.

Hobby Lobby says that's a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed by Congress in 1993 to protect ""a person's exercise of religion"" from government intrusion. Conestoga Wood also alleges that the mandate violates its right under the Constitution to freely exercise its religious beliefs.

""As the federal government embarks on an unprecedented foray into health care replete with multiple overlapping mandates, few issues are more important than the extent to which the government must recognize and accommodate the religious exercise of those it regulates,"" Hobby Lobby argues in its brief.

The Supreme Court already has established that corporations have free-speech rights. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), the justices struck down government restrictions on corporate and union political advertising.

But a generation earlier in 1990, the court ruled in an Oregon case that the government does not have to protect religious beliefs when they conflict with existing laws. That case led Congress to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in an effort to tilt the balance back toward individuals.

Now comes the question that subjected Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to ridicule last year: Are corporations people?

Appeals courts have split down the middle, virtually forcing the Supreme Court to settle the matter. Two federal circuit courts have said private companies should be able to sidestep contraception coverage on religious grounds, including Hobby Lobby. Two have said the companies must comply with the contraception mandate, including Conestoga Wood. And one ruled earlier this month that companies cannot exercise religious beliefs in that way, but their owners can.

""The court took this case because there is a wide and rapidly deepening circuit split on these important issues,"" said Kyle Duncan of The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents Hobby Lobby. ""People who run a commercial business also have religious liberty rights.""

The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Hobby Lobby in a case from Oklahoma, where the company is based. The court said the Obama administration ""has given us no persuasive reason to think that Congress meant 'person' ... to mean anything other than its default meaning in the Dictionary Act — which includes corporations regardless of their profit-making status.""

But Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, warns a decision for the companies could subject other forms of health care to religious freedom challenges, including end-of-life care and coverage for HIV/AIDS.

In a dissent this month from another decision against the contraception policy, Judge Ilana Rovner of the 7th Circuit appeals court raised similar warnings for stem cell therapy, unpaid family leave for gay parents and even traditional medicine, depending on company owners' religious beliefs.

The U.S. solicitor general's office warned in its brief asking the Supreme Court to take the case that a victory for the companies would transform the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ""from a shield for individuals and religious institutions into a sword used to deny employees of for-profit commercial enterprises the benefits and protections of generally applicable laws.""

While most Supreme Court experts had predicted the justices would grant the Hobby Lobby case, the court may have added Conestoga's challenge because that company is owned directly by a family, rather than a trust.

""It's a really significant case,"" says Josh Blackman, an assistant law professor at South Texas College of Law and author of a recent book on the constitutional challenges to Obamacare."

Despite the public lashing Virginia GOP lawmakers took in 2012 over their support for an infamous mandatory ultrasound bill, some of them are kicking off the 2013 legislative session with a slew of new controversial bills that restrict women's access to abortion and birth control.

State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett (R-Lynchburg) has introduced a bill that would prevent Medicaid from subsidizing abortion services for low-income women in cases ""in which a physician certifies ... that the fetus would be born with a gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency."" Women who currently receive Medicaid in Virginia have abortion coverage in cases of rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities, or when the life of the mother is in danger.

Four other abortion- and contraception-related bills have been introduced by Del. Bob Marshall (R-Prince William), the author of the fetal personhood bill that state GOP leadership rejected in November. Three of Marshall's bills would allow insurance providers the option to deny women contraception coverage, and a fourth would impose a criminal ban on doctors who knowingly perform sex-selective abortions.

Marshall's abortion ban, reproductive rights advocates argue, will intimidate doctors and violate doctor-patient confidentiality without solving the problem of gender-related abortions. It could also encourage physicians to racially profile women who are seeking abortions, since the practice of sex-selective abortions is most common in South Asian countries that have a cultural preference for boys.

""This is a sexist and racist bill,"" said Tarina Keene, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, in a conference call with reporters. ""The true purpose under the guise of the concern for gender discrimination is to continue to strip away access to safe legal abortion services.""

It will already likely be harder for Virginia women to access abortions in 2013 than in previous years. Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) quietly approved a controversial set of abortion clinic regulations last week that could shut down many of the clinics in the state. The regulations impose strict building standards that were intended for new hospitals, such as specific hallway widths and hands-free sinks, on first-trimester abortion clinics.

Republican leaders in Virginia have indicated that they will take a softer stance on abortion in 2013, and Marshall told The Huffington Post in November that his GOP colleagues pressure him ""seven days a week, 52 weeks a year"" to drop his anti-abortion legislative efforts. But those efforts are lost on a principled social conservative, he said.

""You're talking about human beings being killed,"" he said. ""What higher considerations do I put out there?"""

Ryan readies the new GOP budget, House Republicans are debating whether to apply the party’s proposed Medicare changes a year earlier than planned, when Americans who are now 56 reach retirement age.

No decision has been made, and Ryan declined to address the internal debate Wednesday. The party’s earlier promise to keep Medicare unchanged for those 55 and older has bumped up against its vow to balance the budget in 10 years.

The Medicare overhaul for the next generation of seniors will be a centerpiece of Ryan’s budget -- and fodder for Democrats’ criticism. Some Republicans indicated the party was more inclined to stick to its original plan rather than impose the new system sooner.

“Our goal is to get a down payment on this problem for America,” said Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman who was his party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee. “We need to prepare for the retirement of the baby boom of this country, to save these programs for not just the current retirees but for the next wave of retirees and the ones after that.”

Ryan’s budget, to be unveiled next week, is expected to be similar to those of past years, an austere blueprint that aims to dramatically reduce government outlays to stem the nation’s rising deficits and resulting debt. A conservative from the supply-side school of economics, Ryan is also expected to propose lowering tax rates for individuals and corporations to stimulate the economy.

Though the White House will almost certainly reject the blueprint, it will provide the opening salvo as Congress and the White House head toward the next pressure point in the budget battles. This summer, Washington will need to raise the debt ceiling again, reigniting President Obama’s calls for a grand bipartisan agreement on new taxes and spending cuts.

Ryan has spent the last several weeks in talks with rank-and-file Republicans who have different views on the best time to start the Medicare changes, which would provide a voucher-like payment that future seniors could apply toward the costs of private insurance or to enroll in traditional Medicare.

Some lawmakers feel compelled to stick with the original promise, which many of them campaigned on leading up to their reelection last fall, and not start the changes until those who are now under 55 become Medicare-eligible, at 65.

Advertisement

Others, though, say the more important pledge is to begin reforming Medicare to help improve the fiscal outlook, and they should pick up where they left off last year by applying the changes to those who are now 56 – arguing that another year has passed.

“Work in progress,” Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), vice chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Wednesday.

Changing the start date comes with political risks, and Democrats have been happy to pounce on the proposed shift as a retreat on a Republican campaign promise.

At the same time, the initial budget savings from changing the age threshold are modest. Experts say the greater Medicare savings could come in future years, as the voucher-style program shifts the growing healthcare costs away from the government.

House Republicans are more unified on the goal of bringing budgets into balance in 10 years.

“I wouldn’t expect big surprises from us next week,” Ryan said. “We’re making some additional modest changes to get to balance.”

Ryan had nearly closed the deficit hole in his past budget efforts, and did not have far to go.

His task was made easier by the new revenue coming from the New Year’s tax hikes, as well as the sequester cuts now slicing across the budget.

A Florida jury ruled that George Zimmerman did not murder Trayvon Martin.

On August 28, Americans will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the famous ""March on Washington.""

In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and delivered one of the most dramatic speeches of his lifetime. His ""I Have A Dream"" speech before 200,000 gathered on the Washington Mall was emotionally stirring, intellectually insightful, and spiritually enlightening.

Dr. King, a dedicated Baptist minister with brilliant oratory skills, the academic prowess of a scholar, and the wisdom of an ancient sage, faithfully and courageously challenged America to embrace his dream of a better, stronger and united America.

King dreamed of a day that black children and white children would live in a nation where they would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

He made an earnest appeal to all men and women from all faiths, nationalities and ethnicity to embrace freedom and justice for all.

[pullquote]

If Dr. King were alive today, he would be 84. What kind of America would he see?

How would he respond to the heated racial debate in the land stemming from the death of Trayvon Martin and the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial?

What would he do to address the black on black crime in our cities?

What would King say about the racial disparities in health, education, employment and incarceration?

What would King say about the role of the Church in all of this?

Based on the speeches, essays, letters and books that Dr. King has written, I believe today he would take note of the various extreme points of view being discussed in today's public square

He would listen to people agitate, bloviate, instigate and aggravate. Then he would seek to elevate, motivate and demonstrate God's view for healing the painful wounds of the past and bridge the deep divide with the bonds of reconciliation.

In 1963, as he sat in a Birmingham jail, he wrote about becoming an extremist to deal with the extreme issues of hate and division.

He advised Americans to become more like Jesus as an extremist in love -- ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them who despitefully use you.""

King posed a question to all Americans; should we become extremists of hate or extremists of love?

In terms of education, Dr. King would continue to strongly encourage African-Americans to view education as the gateway out of poverty.

King applauded the constant streams of African-mericans who were completing college. But today, he would be concerned about the rising trend towards illiteracy in the black community.

Dr. Howard Fuller, co-founder of the faith-based Black Alliance for Educational Options poignantly put it this way: ""On February 6, 1960, four black students from North Carolina A&T College go to a segregated lunch counter at Woolworths in Greensboro and demand to be served. Today in 2013, four black students who are now welcome at the lunch counter sit down and can't read the menu. How does that happen?""

Fuller, who drew inspiration from his parents and Dr. King to seek an education and rise from the housing projects of Milwaukee, Wisconsin to eventually become the city's first Black Superintendent of Schools believes King would be disappointed by the state of education in the black community.

Indeed, in his address to the Golden Anniversary Conference of the National Urban League in 1960, King sighted the steady decline of crippling illiteracy as a major factor in the rapid educational advances among blacks.

He believed education, along with faith in God, and a non-violent struggle against oppression would broaden the thinking of black Americans, provide a larger view of the world, but also a larger view of themselves. Sadly, some of us have taken our eyes off the prize.

Dr. King would be troubled by the current and disturbing trends of violence in the black community.

He would be heartbroken to see the alarming rate of black on black violence in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and other urban areas. He would likely conduct peace marches through the heart of these killing fields.

He would challenge all Americans; but particularly blacks to do something about the violence; to increase the peace on the streets in urban America.

In an article he wrote for Ebony magazine in 1966 titled ""Nonviolence: The Only Road to Freedom in 1966, King sounded the alarm that it is a moral imperative to be non-violent: ""Only a refusal to hate or kill can put an end to the chains of violence in the world and lead us toward a community where men can live together without fear. Our goal is to create a beloved community.""



As King addressed the issues of his time and promoted a society of brotherhood, he wanted to avoid being looked upon as a super and unrealistic optimist in an age of cynicism and pessimism.

He wrote on page 64 of his book, ""Struggle to Love"": As we struggle to defeat the forces of evil, the God of the universe struggles with us. Evil dies on the seashore, not merely because of man's endless struggle against it, but because of God's power to defeat it.""

Dr. King did, and still does, encourage all of us to come to the table of brotherhood, to discuss our differences openly and honestly, to work and pray for a peace that surpasses all understanding.

Dr. King would remind us that in everything we do, we must act in love. Not in some sort of sentimental love.

He explained it would be difficult for men to love their enemies or oppressors in an affectionate sense. Because of that, he pushed the concept of Agape love. He explained that Agape love is not sentimental or affectionate, but is a reciprocal love.

A person will love out of a redeeming good will for mankind. It is the kind of sacrificial love that seeks nothing in return.

King wrote in ""Facing The Challenge of A New Age,"" ...on the Agape level we love men not because we like them, not because their attitudes and ways appeal to us, but because God loves us. Here we rise to the position of loving the person who does the evil deed while hating the deed that the person does...we will be able to stand...with dignity and discipline.""

As a child, I recall being excited to hear Dr. King speak. His words resonated with the same hopeful message that I received from June, my single parent mother.

Their words spoke promise into my soul. They made me feel that if I maintained my faith in God, gained knowledge of the world through a good education, plus worked hard in my career, and then I could accomplish anything.

My mother fervently believed that. She frequently used the words of Dr. King, the Bible, and her own wisdom to help me along my rocky journey to manhood.

One quote from Dr. King that my mother often shared with me is something we should all consider living by, ""If I can help somebody as I travel on, if I can help somebody with a word or a song, If I can help somebody who is traveling wrong, then my living will not be in vain.""

Now is the time to help somebody. Now is the time to follow in King’s footsteps and become drum majors for peace. Now is the time for us to “live together as brothers or perish together as fools.”"

The media has been covering Korte v. HHS, where on Nov. 8 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down Kathleen Sebelius’ regulation that implements a provision of the Affordable Care Act by requiring employers to provide abortion and contraception in their healthcare plans.

The only religious exemption is for churches and other purely-religious employers. But countless secular and for-profit businesses are wholly owned by people of faith, who treat how they run their business as part of how they practice their religious faith, and object to providing products or services they regard as immoral or sinful.

Five federal appellate courts have ruled on the issue thus far. Three have sided with religious business owners, and two have sided with the Obama administration.

On Sept. 18, Breibart News broke the news that the first of these cases has been offered to the Supreme Court when lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed a petition with the justices in Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius. Later that same day, the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to review the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, which ruled in favor of the Green family in Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius.

Two other federal appeals courts have weighed in on the issue. On Nov. 1, the D.C. Circuit sided with religious business owners in Gilardi v. HHS in a well-written opinion by Judge Janice Rogers Brown. And on Sept. 17, the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit supported President Obama and Secretary Sebelius.

Judge Diane Sykes’ excellent opinion for the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit in Korte has deepened this national split in the federal courts. But despite the significant media attention that decision is getting, last week’s opinion is probably the end of the line for Korte.

This is because the Supreme Court has now scheduled the petitions from Hobby Lobby and Conestoga for the justices’ closed-door conference on Nov. 26. The results of that conference could be released that afternoon or, more likely, will be announced when the Court holds its next session on Dec. 2.

It is virtually certain the Supreme Court will take one or both cases. If review is granted, arguments will be in March or April, with a final decision on this issue before July 2014.

Wearing T-shirts that said “Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust,” they demanded that the museum include an exhibit on what they called the “American genocide” of legal abortion, and fanned out to scatter cards with pictures of bloody “late-term abortion victims.”

They then moved outside to picket with a banner calling Albuquerque “America’s Auschwitz.”

Albuquerque has become the latest flash point in the abortion wars, with Operation Rescue, the militant group based in Kansas, calling it the “late-term abortion capital of the country.” This is because a private clinic, Southwestern Women’s Options, is one of only a few nationwide that offers abortions after the sixth month of pregnancy.

A pitched political battle is now under way. After failed attempts in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, abortion opponents have collected enough signatures to hold a referendum over whether to make Albuquerque the first city in the country to ban abortions at 20 weeks after conception, just as a dozen states have done."

Woods, Jr. and the Neo-Confederate Catholic Right","Over the years, this column has looked at the many facets of the Catholic Right, including neo-cons, paleo-cons, Bill Donohue, Opus Dei, and more. We now come to the Neo-Confederate Catholic Right, a peculiar variation of libertarianism, which focuses almost exclusively on economics while maintaining most, if not all of the social conservative culture war issues such as opposition to reproductive rights and marriage equality. Indeed, this movement employs the long discredited states' rights theory of nullification -- the notion that any state has the right to ignore any federal court order or law which that state has deemed unconstitutional.

Among the Catholic Rightists beating the drum for nullification are Pat Buchanan, Thomas DiLorenzo, Thomas Fleming and Thomas E. Woods, Jr. All four advocate states' rights, a seething resentment of Abraham Lincoln, and as Rachel Tabachnick recently highlighted, Woods is a key member of the pro-secession League of the South, Traditional Catholicism (save possibly DiLorenzo) and Austrian-school, libertarian economics.

Woods is a convert to the type of Catholicism sought by many on the Catholic Right. As such, he is a vocal proponent for a return to a pre-Vatican II mindset. He is extreme in his economic libertarianism as well as secession and nullification. While nullification has a long and dark history on matters of race in the U.S., it is also looming as an issue for reproductive rights and marriage equality.

It is therefore no surprise that among Woods' admirers is the influential Opus Dei priest C. John McCloskey. The former Ivy League-Wall Street laissez-faire apostle-turned-prelate has himself ruminated on the appeal of secession to achieve theocracy. In his infamous futuristic dystopian essay 2030: Looking Backwards he gleefully imagines a violent separation from the United States:

The tens of thousands of martyrs and confessors for the Faith in North America were indeed the ""seed of the Church"" as they were in pre-Edict of Milan Christianity. The final short and relatively bloodless conflict produced our Regional States of North America. The outcome was by no means an ideal solution but it does allow Christians to live in states that recognize the natural law and divine Revelation, the right of free practice of religion, and laws on marriage, family, and life that reflect the primacy of our Faith. With time and the reality of the ever-decreasing population of the states that worship at the altar of ""the culture of death,"" perhaps we will be able to reunite and fulfill the Founding Fathers of the old United States dream to be ""a shining city on a hill.""

What McCloskey describes as ""by no means an ideal solution"" has a more accurate, more commonly-held description: Treason.

And yet there is more than a hint of hypocrisy in McCloskey's admiration of Woods - especially his libertarian economic outlook. Catholic writer Angus Sibely has observed, Woods is a devotee of über-libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard. A closer examination of Rothbard beliefs reveals why this is problematic.

First, Rothbard is the father of anarcho-capitalism, the basis of Woods' economic philosophy. It is such an extreme philosophy that even law enforcement and the courts would be privatized; taxation would be replaced by either private payments or insurance settlements. Rothbard is on record saying ""the entire theory of labor unions is deeply flawed."" As Angus Sibley explains, it is the very antithesis of Catholic economic teachings:

Most practical methods of reducing inequalities are repugnant to libertarians. Labor unions are hated because they obstruct the worker's freedom to agree his own contract with his employer. ... Redistributive taxation (higher tax rates on higher personal incomes) ""is a mode of disguised expropriation of successful capitalists and entrepreneurs"" according to Mises, while his admirer Murray Rothbard stated that ""Taxation is Robbery"" and that ""the libertarian favors the right to unrestricted private property and free-exchange"". Hayek rejected outright the principle of distributive justice: ""the results of the individual's efforts are necessarily unpredictable, and the question of whether the resulting distribution of incomes is just or unjust has no meaning."" Catholic teaching flatly repudiates such nonsense. Leo XIII (Rerum Novarum, §45) spoke of ""a dictate of natural justice more imperious and ancient than any bargain between man and man, namely that wages ought not to be insufficient to support a frugal and well-behaved wage-earner"", and he strongly commended (#49) workers' associations, of which ""the most important of all are workingmen's unions."" John Paul II (Centesimus Annus, §20) observed that ""unions... are indeed a mouthpiece for the struggle for social justice, for the just rights of working people.""

But what is all-too-conveniently glossed over by Woods, McCloskey and others -- is Rothbard's shocking and idiosyncratic view on abortion. It is a view that is consistent with extreme libertarianism, but is very far from any other pro-choice thought I have ever heard. Rothbard's view suggests a deep fissure on the conservative spectrum that they would rather we not see.

Most fetuses are in the mother's womb because the mother consents to this situation, but the fetus is there by the mother's freely-granted consent. But should the mother decide that she does not want the fetus there any longer, then the fetus becomes a parasitic ""invader"" of her person, and the mother has the perfect right to expel this invader from her domain. Abortion should be looked upon, not as ""murder"" of a living person, but as the expulsion of an unwanted invader from the mother's body. Any laws restricting or prohibiting abortion are therefore invasions of the rights of mothers. [Emphasis added]

We need to understand why Woods and McCloskey's Neo-Confederate philosophy of nullification and secession is so appealing to some on the Catholic Right so we can not only better answer them, but sharpen the contrast with just alternatives. Those tasks will be tackled in subsequent posts.

But such attitudes have drastically changed, according to a new study that finds the two states last in individual freedom.

The “Freedom in the 50 States” study published last week by the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center ranks New York last and California second to last.

The survey is based on fiscal issues such as job prospects and tax rates, regulatory policies that include property rights and personal freedoms such as gun laws.

“When it comes to overall freedom, New York ranks dead last,” the study’s authors said.

They point out that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has taken away – or at least tried to take away – several personal freedoms, including his failed effort to outlaw the sale of sodas 16 ounces and larger.

“Though the law ran into a judicial buzz saw on the eve of its enactment earlier this month, it demonstrates the attitude city and state legislators have toward their constituents,” the authors noted.

Bloomberg has already imposed a stiff tax on cigarette sales and is a leading advocate for tougher gun laws.

In addition, New Yorkers pay a state income tax of 14 percent.

“Even New Yorkers who don't care about sweet drinks have to deal with the highest state and local tax burden in the country,” the authors wrote.

The result is New Yorkers are voting with their feet, with roughly 1.7 million leaving between 2000 and 2010, though newborns and new immigrants are keeping the state's population steady, according to the study.

“We’re not living in a police state,” White Plains attorney John Murtagh told CBS New York. “But the economics of New York clearly don’t work. And then you see things like Mike Bloomberg and his Big Gulp sodas.”

The top five states with the most freedom are North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, New Hampshire and Oklahoma, according to the study from the center, at George Mason University in Virginia.

North Dakota came in first in large part based of its “very low taxes” and government debt, the authors said. “However, its spending is uncharacteristically high.”

The three other lowest ranking states are Rhode Island, Hawaii and New Jersey, in descending order.

The study authors said California's biggest problem is business regulation, though a recent attempt to impose a higher tax rate on the state’s highest earners has become a major complaint among residents.

“The Golden State, with hundreds of miles of picturesque Pacific coastline, nonetheless managed to drive off a net of 1.5 million residents between 2000 and 2010 -- over 4 percent of its 2000 population,” the authors wrote.

They also pointed out Californians' personal income contracted by 0.4 percent a year in the seven years before the Great Recession struck, a record worse than any other state besides Michigan."
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/north-carolina-abortion-bill_n_3569509.html,2013-07-09 00:00:00,[],North Carolina Abortion Bill Hits Hurdle Over Safety Standards,"RALEIGH, N.C., July 9 (Reuters) - Proposed new safety standards on abortion clinics in North Carolina hit a snag on Tuesday after Republican lawmakers said they would consult more with state regulators before deciding whether to vote on them.

The bill, which would require abortion clinics to meet the same safety standards as ambulatory surgical centers, passed the Republican-controlled state Senate last week in a 24-hour span of activity that the state's Republican governor criticized as hurried.

If lawmakers do not pass the new standards before their current session ends, which could be as soon as next week, they will have to wait until January to revisit the issue.

Nine states have similar safety standards on the books.

Texas lawmakers are considering the new standards, which also require a doctor to be present when women take the so-called ""abortion pill,"" even as widespread protests take place at the state Capitol in Austin. On Monday, a judge in Wisconsin temporarily blocked a new law that would require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges in nearby hospitals.

In North Carolina, the safety standards were tacked on to an unrelated bill with no public notice or hearing last week, and quickly pushed through the state Senate.

Opponents celebrated the delay but cautioned that the battle is not over.

""It's a small victory,"" said Democratic State Senator Earline Parmon.

The Senate passage of the safety standards sparked protests and was the focus of a ""Moral Monday"" demonstration that drew an estimated 2,000 people to the capitol building on Monday night.

North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory criticized the Senate for pushing the abortion legislation through in relative secrecy, and House leaders responded by holding a public hearing on Tuesday.

At the hearing, North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Aldona Wos said funding more frequent inspections of abortion clinics might go further in ensuring safety.

Her staff estimated that the measure would raise the cost of building a clinic by about $1 million.

Republican sponsors of the measure said they expect to work on the bill over the next two days, although legislative rules prohibit them from amending the same bill at this stage.

Opponents told lawmakers the changes would take away access to safe and legal abortions for women.

""The majority of North Carolinians want you all to focus on jobs, the economy and increasing access to health care, not stripping away a woman's choices,"" said Suzanne Buckley, Executive Director at NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina.

But supporters, mostly Republicans, said the higher standards will increase safety.

""We're not here to take away the rights of women,"" said North Carolina state Senator Warren Daniel, a Republican who helped push the Senate legislation toward passage. ""We're taking away the right of an industry to operate health clinics under substandard conditions."" (Editing By Karen Brooks and Bernard Orr)"

After describing the Senate Democratic proposal as not bad, but basically insufficient because it does not call for ""substantial though temporary spending increases"" which would logically follow from its own analysis, he notes of the CPC proposal that it calls for such increases, largely offsetting them by ""higher taxes on the wealthy, corporations and pollution.""

Of even greater importance, he takes apart the notion of false equivalency, that somehow the CPC budget is a ""Ryan plan of the left"" -

There are no Ryan-style magic asterisks, trillion-dollar savings that are assumed to come from unspecified sources; this is an honest proposal. And “Back to Work” rests on solid macroeconomic analysis, not the fantasy “expansionary austerity” economics — the claim that slashing spending in a depressed economy somehow promotes job growth rather than deepening the depression — that Mr. Ryan continues to espouse despite the doctrine’s total failure in Europe.

it’s refreshing to see someone break with the usual Washington notion that political “courage” means proposing that we hurt the poor while sparing the rich.

Mr. Ryan’s efforts are finally starting to get the derision they deserve, while progressives seem, at long last, to be finding their voice. Little by little, Washington’s fog of fiscal flimflam seems to be lifting.

The plan may, according to Krugman, be as equally audacious as Ryan's proposal, and therefore probably has as little chance of being enacted, but as he writesHis sense is we are unlikely to get a grand bargain, what movement there is is ""in a direction conservatives won’t like"" and thatNow if only the President were not so fixed on the notion of the Grand Bargain, as he clearly is. If only he would listen to the likes of Krugman and the CPC instead of Simpson and Bowles and Jack Lew.

The one hope we do have is that resistance from Democrats has increased enough that the President might not be able to put together majorities in either chamber of Congress in favor of a grand bargain, with Republicans firmly against raising tax rates or further closing loopholes and Democrats increasingly opposed to cutting benefits on the needy and the middle class.

It is worth noting that the amount of savings aimed for in the originally Simpson Bowles have been more than half accomplished already, and that projections of the impact of the Affordable Care Act helps seriously slow the growth of Medicare spending. Putting people to work will increase tax revenues at all levels of government, including payments into Medicare and Social Security, as well as decreasing expenditures on unemployment and Medicaid.

Of the three budget proposals out there, that of the Congressional Progressives is the one that makes the most sense, and the only one whose numbers actually work.

Too bad the Washington consensus does not yet grasp that.

It is nice that Krugman gives it appropriate credit.

And it is even nicer that he again properly labels Ryan and his proposals for what they are: fiscal flimflam

But they have had limited success: Only seven states have such measures in place, including California, Connecticut and Maryland; the most recent state to adopt such a law is Hawaii, which did so in 2006.

“Pretty much all of the energy, all of the momentum, has been to restrict abortion, which makes what could potentially happen in New York so interesting,” said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. “There’s no other state that’s even contemplating this right now.”

In most statehouses, the push by lawmakers has been in the opposite direction. The past two years has seen more provisions adopted at the state level to restrict abortion rights than in any two-year period in decades, according to the Guttmacher Institute; last year, 19 states adopted 43 new provisions restricting abortion access, while not a single significant measure was adopted to expand access to abortion or to comprehensive sex education.

“It’s an extraordinary moment in terms of the degree to which there is government interference in a woman’s ability to make these basic health care decisions,” said Andrea Miller, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice New York. “For New York to be able to send a signal, a hopeful sign, a sense of the turning of the tide, we think is really important.”

Abortion rights advocates say that even though the Roe decision supersedes state law, some doctors are hesitant to perform late-term abortions when a woman’s health is at risk because the criminal statutes remain on the books.

“Doctors and hospitals shouldn’t be reading criminal laws to determine what types of health services they can offer and provide to their patients,” said M. Tracey Brooks, the president of Family Planning Advocates of New York State.

For Mr. Cuomo, the debate over passing a new abortion law presents an opportunity to appeal to women as well as to liberals, who have sought action in Albany without success since Eliot Spitzer made a similar proposal when he was governor. But it also poses a challenge to the coalition of Republicans and a few Democrats that controls the State Senate, the chamber that has in the past stood as the primary obstacle to passing abortion legislation in the capital."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/opinion/three-cheers-for-the-nanny-state.html,2013-03-25 00:00:00,['Sarah Conly'],Three Cheers for the Nanny State - The New York Times,"We also suffer from a status quo bias, which makes us value what we’ve already got over the alternatives, just because we’ve already got it — which might, of course, make us react badly to new laws, even when they are really an improvement over what we’ve got. And there are more.

The crucial point is that in some situations it’s just difficult for us to take in the relevant information and choose accordingly. It’s not quite the simple ignorance Mill was talking about, but it turns out that our minds are more complicated than Mill imagined. Like the guy about to step through the hole in the bridge, we need help.

Is it always a mistake when someone does something imprudent, when, in this case, a person chooses to chug 32 ounces of soda? No. For some people, that’s the right choice. They don’t care that much about their health, or they won’t drink too many big sodas, or they just really love having a lot of soda at once.

But laws have to be sensitive to the needs of the majority. That doesn’t mean laws should trample the rights of the minority, but that public benefit is a legitimate concern, even when that may inconvenience some.

So do these laws mean that some people will be kept from doing what they really want to do? Probably — and yes, in many ways it hurts to be part of a society governed by laws, given that laws aren’t designed for each one of us individually. Some of us can drive safely at 90 miles per hour, but we’re bound by the same laws as the people who can’t, because individual speeding laws aren’t practical. Giving up a little liberty is something we agree to when we agree to live in a democratic society that is governed by laws.

The freedom to buy a really large soda, all in one cup, is something we stand to lose here. For most people, given their desire for health, that results in a net gain. For some people, yes, it’s an absolute loss. It’s just not much of a loss.

Of course, what people fear is that this is just the beginning: today it’s soda, tomorrow it’s the guy standing behind you making you eat your broccoli, floss your teeth, and watch “PBS NewsHour” every day. What this ignores is that successful paternalistic laws are done on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis: if it’s too painful, it’s not a good law. Making these analyses is something the government has the resources to do, just as now it sets automobile construction standards while considering both the need for affordability and the desire for safety."

Arkansas law bans most abortions after 12th week of pregnancy

North Dakota law bans abortions as early as sixth week of pregnancy

Laws challenge 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established right to abortion

Rival legal teams, well-financed and highly motivated, are girding for court battles over the coming months on laws enacted in Arkansas and North Dakota that would impose the nation's toughest bans on abortion.

For all their differences, attorneys for the two states and the abortion-rights supporters opposing them agree on this: The laws represent an unprecedented frontal assault on the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to abortion.

The Arkansas law, approved March 6 when legislators overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe, would ban most abortions from the 12th week of pregnancy onward. On March 26, North Dakota went further, with Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple signing a measure that would ban abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when a fetal heartbeat can first be detected and before some women even know they're pregnant.

Abortion-rights advocates plan to challenge both measures, contending they are unconstitutional violations of the Roe ruling that legalized abortion until a fetus could viably survive outside the womb. A fetus is generally considered viable at 22 to 24 weeks.

""I think they're going to be blocked immediately by the courts — they are so far outside the clear bounds of what the Supreme Court has said for 40 years,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The center will be leading the North Dakota legal challenge and working in Arkansas alongside the American Civil Liberties Union's state and national offices. Both Northup and ACLU lawyers say they have ample resources to wage the battles, and they expect victories that would require their attorneys' fees to be paid by two states.

Dalrymple, in signing the ban, acknowledged that its chances of surviving a court challenge were questionable, but said it was worth the eventual price tag — at this point unknown — in order to test the boundaries of Roe.

North Dakota's attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem, initially said lawyers from his office would defend any lawsuits but is now considering hiring outside help. His office is working on a cost estimate for the litigation that could be presented to lawmakers soon.

""We're looking at a sufficient amount to adequately defend these enactments,"" Stenehjem said.

A lead sponsor of the Arkansas ban, Republican state Sen. Jason Rapert, said threats of lawsuits ""should not prevent someone from doing what is right.""

He contended that the ban had a chance of reaching the U.S. Supreme Court through the appeals process and suggested that the victory predictions made by abortion-rights lawyers amounted to ""posturing"" aimed at deterring other states from enacting similar bans.

In both Arkansas and North Dakota, the states' lawyers will be getting pro bono assistance from lawyers with Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian legal group.

Mathew Staver, the group's chairman, said supporters of the bans were resolved to fight the legal battles to the end, and issued a caution to the rival side.

""They ought to hold off on their celebrations,"" he said. ""The cases have a long way to go through the court system.""

The North Dakota ban is scheduled to take effect Aug. 1, along with two other measures that have angered abortion-rights backers. One would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, the other would make North Dakota the first state to ban abortions based on genetic defects such as Down syndrome.

The Center for Reproductive Rights is reviewing its options regarding the latter two bills, but definitely plans to challenge the 6-week ban before Aug. 1. Northup said her team is pondering whether to file suit in state court or U.S. district court.

In Arkansas, where the 12-week ban would take effect 90 days after the end of the legislative session, abortion-rights lawyers plan to file their challenge in federal court within the next few weeks.

Bettina Brownstein, who will be representing the ACLU of Arkansas in the case, said the U.S. district court with jurisdiction over Little Rock had issued rulings in past abortion-related cases that gave her confidence of victory this time.

""Eventually it could go to U.S. Supreme Court on appeal, but that would take a while, and they may not want to hear it,"" she said. ""It's a question of how much money the state wants to spend.""

Northup chided officials in both Arkansas and North Dakota for their willingness to spend taxpayers' money on difficult and divisive legal cases.

""It's important that the citizens of those states realize that every dollar spent to defend blatantly unconstitutional laws is taxpayers' dollars wasted,"" she said.

Attorneys' fees for the upcoming cases are impossible to estimate at this stage, but Northup said her organization received $1.3 million in fees from Alaska after that state lost a recent case regarding an abortion-related law.

The last few years have been intensely busy for the Center for Reproductive Rights, the ACLU and other abortion-rights legal groups as Republican-controlled legislatures have enacted scores of laws seeking to restrict access to abortion. At least two dozen such measures are currently the target of lawsuits, said Northup, who vowed that her organization ""will not let unconstitutional laws go on challenged.""

Some of the recent laws place new requirements on abortion clinics, others require abortion providers to perform certain procedures or offer state-mandated counseling before an abortion can take place.

At least 10 states have passed bills banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that stage. One of those laws, in Idaho, was struck down by a U.S. district judge on March 6, while the laws in Georgia and Arizona have been temporarily blocked by judges pending further court proceedings.

Abortion-rights advocates, while eager to defeat the new bans in North Dakota and Arkansas, worry about the impact of the broader surge of restrictions.

""I don't believe these bans are going to take effect, but the danger is that they make the other laws look reasonable,"" said Talcott Camp, deputy director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project. ""The ultimate goal is to take this decision away from a woman and her doctor and give it to the politicians.""

One of the most frequent targets of the anti-abortion laws is the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which — in addition to providing a range of other health services — is the nation's leading provider of abortions.

Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards, said she found it frustrating that women ""continue to be a political punching bag."" But she saw an upside to the wave of anti-abortion legislation: more members and more donations for her organization.

""These attacks have served to energize our supporters,"" she said. ""We've gained 2 million members in the past two years.""

There's new energy on the other side as well.

The tough North Dakota laws have been welcomed by the protesters who gather weekly in Fargo outside the state's lone abortion clinic.

Among those on hand for the latest protest at the Red River Women's Clinic was Scott Carew, 50, who had brought two anti-abortion posters nailed to pieces of wood.

""Certainly, we're proud of the governor standing up for life,"" Carew said. ""We're going to keep standing up for life until we can't stand up anymore.""

Savage Has Covered The Supreme Court', 'Legal Issues For The Los Angeles Times In The Washington Bureau Since']",Supreme Court vote upholds Texas abortion law,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court cleared the way Tuesday for Texas to enforce a strict new abortion regulation that opponents say prevents a third of the state’s clinics from performing the procedure.

The court, in a 5-4 vote, split along ideological lines in turning down an appeal to block the law that abortion rights advocates challenged as unconstitutional.

The measure, adopted by Texas lawmakers in July, requires that abortion providers have a doctor on their staffs who has admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic.

By rejecting the request, the justices signaled they do not think the Texas law puts an unconstitutional barrier before women seeking an abortion. The Planned Parenthood Federation said the law had forced 12 of the state’s 36 licensed abortion providers to stop offering abortions.

Justice Stephen G. Breyer said in a dissent that the action “seriously disrupts” the status quo.

“By putting Texas’ new law into immediate effect, it instantly leaves 24 counties in the Rio Grande Valley with no abortion provider,” he said, adding that “it may substantially reduce access to safe abortions elsewhere in Texas.” Breyer cited a brief from Planned Parenthood that estimated that 20,000 women in Texas would be left without service.

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Breyer’s dissent. They said the law should have been put on hold “while the lower courts consider this difficult, sensitive and controversial legal matter.”

Justice Antonin Scalia, in defending the high court’s action, said Breyer and the abortion rights advocates had no basis for “asserting that the [Texas] law is even probably unconstitutional.” He said Planned Parenthood had not “carried the heavy burden” of showing the law was unconstitutional, adding that there was “no special ‘status quo’ standard for laws affecting abortion.” Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. signed on to Scalia’s statement.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not make any comment but voted to reject the appeal.

“This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions,” Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement issued after the court’s decision. “As always, Texas will continue doing everything we can to protect the culture of life in our state.”

Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation, said: “While we are deeply disappointed, this isn’t over. We will take every step we can to protect the health of Texas women.” She said the law “demonstrates why we need stronger federal protections for women’s health. Your rights and your ability to make your own medical decisions should not depend on your ZIP Code.”

The Texas law is one of several recent state measures adopted by Republican-controlled legislatures that seek to regulate or restrict abortion without banning it. The laws are drafted in a manner that they are expected to be upheld by the Supreme Court’s conservative-leaning majority that includes Kennedy. In the past, he has voted to uphold abortion regulations, but has refused to strike down Roe vs. Wade and the right to legal abortion.

Texas state lawyers called the “admitting privileges” rule a medical regulation designed to protect the health of women and ensure that clinics had well-qualified doctors on staff who would be there if a patient faced a medical emergency.

But abortion rights advocates said that many hospitals, fearing local criticism, were reluctant to grant admitting privileges to doctors who performed abortions. Moreover, they said hospitals admit patients needing emergency care without regard to whether the patient’s doctor has admitting privileges, making the law irrelevant.

A federal judge had initially blocked the admitting-privilege rule from taking effect and said there was no “rational basis” to believe it would improve healthcare for abortion patients.

Texas Atty. Gen. Greg Abbott quickly appealed and won a reversal from the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. In a 3-0 decision, its judges said the law was valid and reasonable, and could take effect.

The judges agreed with Texas state lawyers, who argued that pregnant women in the Rio Grande Valley could drive to abortion clinics about 100 miles away. “An increase in travel distance of less than 150 miles for some women is not an undue burden on abortion rights,” Judge Priscilla Owen wrote for the 5th Circuit.

The Planned Parenthood Federation filed its emergency appeal with the Supreme Court on Nov. 4. Its attorney said the law would “render the constitutional right to abortion illusory for nearly 1 in 3 Texas women who would exercise that right.”

Mark Obenshain (R) won the Republican nomination for attorney general this weekend, Think Progress dug up a bill he introduced in 2009 that would have required a woman to report her miscarriage to the police within 24 hours of it happening or risk jail time.

A spokesperson for Obenshain told HuffPost on Monday that the senator introduced the bill in response to a news story about a 20-year-old college student who allegedly disposed of her dead newborn in the trash in Rockingham County, Virginia. Jared Walczak, Obenshain's deputy campaign manager for policy, said Obenshain was trying to pass a law to enable law enforcement to prosecute a woman in that circumstance, but he ended up with a bill that threatened all pregnant women with prosecution in the event that they miscarry.

""As sometimes happens, the legislation that emerged was far too broad, and would have had ramifications that neither he nor the Commonwealth's attorney's office ever intended,"" Walczak said. ""Sen. Obenshain is strongly against imposing any added burden for women who suffer a miscarriage, and that was never the intent of the legislation.""

Walczak said Obenshain met with representatives of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia in an attempt to resolve the problem, but he was unable to come up with a solution, so he withdrew the bill.

NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia confirmed that Obenshain reached out to them about the bill in 2009, and they told him they did not support it.

Tarina Keene, the group's executive director, told HuffPost, ""In 2009 we made it clear to Sen. Obenshain that NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia vehemently opposed his bill to criminalize tragic pregnancy complications and intimidate grieving Virginian women with the threat of law enforcement -- not to mention jail time. Although Sen. Obenshain did reach out to us amidst public backlash for a 'solution,' we clearly told him we would support nothing but immediate defeat of the legislation. While I'm relieved that he eventually decided to pull his bill, it is deeply troubling that an elected official would even consider such a callous and insulting effort.""

Obenshain joins a wave of far-right social conservatives running for office in Virginia, including gubernatorial candidate and current attorney general Ken Cuccinelli and his running mate, Bishop E.W. Jackson. As a state senator, Cuccinelli co-sponsored personhood legislation that would have granted legal rights to embryos, and Jackson made a YouTube video last year in which he compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan."

Negotiators emerged upbeat from a closed-door meeting in the Capitol and said they remained on track to produce a bill by June. That, in itself, was significant, after the group of eight was on the verge of breakup.

“We were all positive that we can move forward,” said Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, a top Republican leading the bipartisan effort.

House Republican leaders are increasingly concerned that momentum in the Senate, where a bipartisan immigration bill cleared a committee this week, will leave them on defense without their own proposal.

Trying to avoid that outcome, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) publicly drew a line Thursday by saying his chamber would not accept the Senate legislation.

“The House remains committed to fixing our broken immigration system, but we will not simply take up and accept the bill that is emerging in the Senate if it passes,” Boehner and his GOP leadership team said in a joint statement as the private meeting was ending. “The House will work its will and produce its own legislation.”

House Democrats have their own internal divisions as they determine whether it is best to put their weight behind the Senate bill, which hews more to their political priorities, or push the House group to finish its bipartisan proposal that is certain to be more conservative than the Senate effort.

How exactly the House will proceed remained an open question as lawmakers left town for the weeklong Memorial Day recess without firm agreement on the healthcare issue.

Federal law already guarantees emergency care for anyone who shows up at an emergency room, and under the emerging House plan, that would not change.

The House group has already agreed that as an estimated 11 million immigrants lacking proper papers begin the decade-long transition to legal status, they would not have access to key healthcare benefits that are available to Americans.

Chief among those would be exclusion from receiving the tax subsidies that will be available to help Americans cover the costs of mandatory insurance coverage required by the new healthcare law. That is also the case in the Senate legislation.

The House and Senate will, however, allow immigrants who are gaining legal status to use their own money to buy health coverage on the new healthcare exchanges. The health exchanges will be available next year to sell policies to Americans who are not offered healthcare coverage through their employers.

Republicans in the House group have tried to mandate that immigrants purchase health coverage or risk deportation – a provision Democrats argue is too harsh.

Many immigrants would be unable to afford privately purchased coverage, as is the case now for many working Americans for whom private policies are too expensive.

Immigrant advocates argue that the threat of deportation may prevent immigrants from seeking basic healthcare, including vaccinations or treatment for communicable diseases.

The House group agreed to keep working on the issue, perhaps only to require that immigrants make a good faith effort to pay their routine healthcare bills, and perhaps excluding costs from emergency room visits.

“Constitutionally, you can’t deny people emergency care, so you just have to comply with the Constitution,” Labrador said.

“The key is -- skip out on their bills,” he explained. “They can do like any other American that has to make payments on their bills. There just has to be personal responsibility.”

The details still need to be worked out. But for many lawmakers in the group, staying together to keep working on the bill was itself a battle won.

“I’m very pleased,” said Rep. Luis Gutierrez (R-Ill.) “We’re going to continue.”

Samuels: But the argument is exploited by people who aren't using it for medical reasons

He says some passionate defenders of pot legalization just want to smoke and get high

Samuels: To marijuana abusers everywhere: Are you really that weak that you need pot?

At first glance, my 11-year-old son seems like your everyday, all-American kid. He loves baseball and basketball, plays Xbox with his friends when they come over, and posts innocuous pictures of the family dog on his Instagram feed. Given these mundane facts about the boy, you can imagine my surprise when, while watching the news (again, seemingly from out of nowhere) he asked me, ""If pot is so bad, why are they trying to legalize it?""

And, just like that, the long and involved talk my wife and I had given our children about drugs was tossed out the window.

We had explained the harmful effects of marijuana. Like cigarettes, smoking marijuana introduces tar, carbon monoxide and cancer-causing agents into your body.

Neither my wife nor I anticipated that our son would be stopped on the street by unscrupulous potheads petitioning outside of the local grocery store and being fed a line of rhetoric that went against what we were trying to teach him.

It turns out that potheads weren't exactly the problem; they were the symptom. Let me tell you why.

Howard C. Samuels

If you have a fever and you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have pneumonia, do you ask him to treat the fever, or do you ask him to treat the pneumonia? Most of us would ask him to treat the pneumonia because the pneumonia is the problem; the fever is the symptom.

It's the same way with the argument about the legalization of marijuana. I'm not interested in focusing on the symptom; I want to eradicate the problem. And the problem is that we're even considering legalizing marijuana at all.

Let's take a look at the medical marijuana issue in Los Angeles (where I live) and we can see where legalization takes us. It has been my experience that anyone can get a medical marijuana card in L.A.; all you need is $25-$100 and the ability to lie about needing it. You just make an appointment with some company, walk in and state your problem(s) and why you need a card (with no proof of medical conditions whatsoever) and you will be prescribed a card that is good for one year. It's a toothless system that isn't well-regulated.

Why are some of the people who petition for legalizing marijuana so passionate about it? Because when you smoke pot, you get loaded. You fry your brain. That's why the patients I see in my treatment center call it ""getting baked."" Pot is all about getting really high.

Now, I have nothing against people who smoke pot. In fact, I believe it is a crime to put someone in prison for smoking pot. Honestly, do we really need some idiot frat boy to get picked up during Mardi Gras for smoking pot and find himself locked in a cage with a monster for six months? Kevin Sabet, a former senior adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy poses a terrific point when he says that criminal processing for possession of marijuana needs improvement, but legalization is a step too far.

Marijuana supporters like to argue that marijuana is similar to alcohol. While alcohol is legal, it also accounts for tens of thousands of deaths every year in car accidents or other drinking-related misfortunes. But we can't turn the clock back on that one because it's too embedded in our society.

Supporters of marijuana say that marijuana should be legalized because old people and women and children who have ailments like glaucoma or cancer or intractable seizures need it.

It is painful to watch people suffer. I am not against helping people. In a perfect world, a woman suffering from cancer should be able to get a prescription from her doctor, go to a pharmacy, acquire her medical marijuana, go home and recuperate from her last round of chemotherapy. But we don't live in a perfect world, and you don't need a Ph.D. to see that the spirit of that argument is being exploited by people who aren't using the marijuana for medical reasons at all; they are using it to get high.

Introducing legalized marijuana into our culture would be like using gasoline to put out a fire, because it stunts growth.

Do you know why we don't see potheads out in public? It's because they're sitting at home smoking weed and staring at their television sets or playing video games all day. Do you have any idea how many marijuana addicts I encounter at my rehab on a daily basis? They talk about wanting to be productive. But what pot does is it kills their motivation -- it destroys people's ability to go out and work and to have a career. It makes them want to do nothing but lie around all day. Is that what you want for your children? Is that what you want for your loved ones?

And how do you market marijuana? We have only just now moved into an era where cigarette smoking is commonly known to be harmful, but now advertisers have a new product to sell. Who do you think they're going to market their product to? Not you or me, because we're not stupid enough to believe the lie; we know too much. They're going to follow in the footsteps of the cigarette companies in the 1980s and market this stuff to young people.

The very idea of that sickens me. I know what marijuana does to the human mind because I started smoking weed when I was 15 years old. It literally robbed me of my motivation to participate in my own life. I was absolutely OK with sitting around all day eating cookies and watching television and getting high with my friends. But, to go out and earn a living and do something with my life? That was all stuff that I was going to do later after I came down off of the marijuana. But, then I'd smoke some more and think, ""Why bother?"" . . . and, eventually, I started shooting heroin. If my family had not intervened and sought professional help, I would probably still be wandering aimlessly through the streets today; searching for that elusive ""perfect high.""

Even if you only stay with marijuana in your repertoire of illicit drugs to abuse, it will never yield positive results. Ever.

And, I posit this to marijuana abusers everywhere: Are you really that weak? Are you really that uncomfortable in your own skin that you can't handle living your life or having real experiences without being high? Is it really impossible for you to live life without a drug? Because, if it is, it breaks my heart and I feel sorry for you. Because that's no way to live.

And my kid, he's going to know the truth about you. He's going to know that every time you approach him arguing for the legalization of marijuana, what you're really doing is asking him to vote to make it OK for you to spend the rest of your life half-baked on your sofa, too stoned to go out and play with your own kids or do the things you've always dreamed of doing. To my kid, I'm going to say that this means one less competitor on his road to a successful and fulfilling life.

And, to the potheads who are so passionate about being allowed to smoke their lives away, I have only one thing to say: Dream On.

Lawmakers from both parties and across the political spectrum found common ground and passed, by a near-unanimous vote, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which firmly commits the federal government to protecting and promoting our “inalienable right” to freely exercise religion. As President Clinton remarked when he signed the legislation into law, “the power of God is such that even in the legislative process, miracles can happen.”

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases that are testing the strength of this commitment. The arguments and decisions in the Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood lawsuits will say a lot about the health, and the future, of what Clinton called our “first freedom.”

These cases involve religious liberty challenges by two family businesses to the rule in the Affordable Care Act requiring employers to provide insurance coverage for contraception and some drugs that many believe can cause abortions.

YEAR IN REVIEW: Washington’s 5 biggest ‘fails’ of 2013

The Green family has not confined its Christian beliefs to Sunday worship, and has instead expressed them through the operation of its Hobby Lobby stores for nearly 40 years. Similarly, the Hahn family’s Mennonite faith has animated and sustained its woodworking business for generations.

Like millions of religious believers and groups, these challengers reject the idea that religious faith and religious freedom are simply about what we believe and how we pray, and not also about how we live, act and work. At the heart of these two cases is the straightforward argument that federal law does not require us to “check our faith at the door” when we pursue vocations in business and commerce.

There should be no question about the sincerity of the religious beliefs at issue. These are not cases where the profit-focused managers of publicly traded mega-companies are cynically trying to save a few bucks or to gain a competitive edge.

As many would-be Sunday shoppers know, the Green family “walks the walk.” Signs on Hobby Lobby stores’ doors say that they close on Sundays “to allow employees time for worship and to spend time with their families.” Their stores do not carry shot glasses, lewd greeting cards or vulgar posters, and the background music is Christian. Hobby Lobby contributes generously to charities and starts full-time employees at nearly double the minimum wage. When the Greens and Hobby Lobby do this, and many other things, they are living out their faith and exercising their religion.

Hobby Lobby also provides excellent health insurance, which includes coverage for most — but not all — contraceptives. However, because of the Greens’ firm belief in the dignity of human life and about when and how it begins, Hobby Lobby cannot provide coverage for some of the required drugs because they could cause an abortion.

The government and others argue that the Greens’ religious beliefs are irrelevant because they’ve freely chosen to enter the rough-and-tumble world of commerce and that, in any event, the exercise of religion is for individuals, not corporations. But Hobby Lobby’s lawyers at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty will be on solid ground when they explain to the court that both of these arguments are misguided.

The issue is not whether groups, associations and corporations have religious freedom rights under federal law. Of course they do. After all, religious hospitals, schools, social service agencies and churches are not “individuals,” but it would be bizarre to say that they don’t exercise religion.

And the question should not be whether legal protections for religious liberty stop at the sanctuary door or evaporate when a person is trying to make a living or a business is aiming to make a profit. At a time when we talk a lot about corporate responsibility and worry about the feeble influence of ethics and values on Wall Street decision-making, it would be strange if the law were to welcome sermonizing from Starbucks on the government shutdown but tell the Greens and Hobby Lobby to focus strictly on the bottom line.

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act reaffirmed an idea that is deeply rooted in America’s history and traditions — namely, that politics and policy should respect and, whenever possible, make room for religious commitments and conscientious objections. True, religious liberty is not absolute, and, in a pluralistic society like ours, not all requests for exemptions and accommodations can, or should, be granted. Some religious liberty lawsuits will, and should, fail, but not simply because they involve what happens at work on Monday and not what happens in services on the Sabbath.

What Clinton said when he signed the act into law is worth remembering today: “Let us never believe that the freedom of religion imposes on any of us some responsibility to run from our convictions.” He challenged us instead to “bring our values back to the table of American discourse to heal our troubled land.” The Greens and Hobby Lobby, by refusing to check their faith at the marketplace door, are doing just that.

He Also Serves As Chairman Of The Department Of Obstetrics Gynecology', ""Reproductive Science At Hackensack University Medical Center In New Jersey. For More Information On Dr. Manny'S Work""]",Is there a hidden scandal lurking in ObamaCare?,"America, we are in trouble – and we better wake up and act.

Just look at the state of affairs in our country today. We are seeing scandal after scandal, with the Benghazi controversy, the IRS targeting of conservative groups, and the freedom of the press being challenged by the Department of Justice.

The word scandal is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as “an action or event regarded as morally or legally wrong and causing general public outrage.” I think the implementation of ObamaCare fulfills that definition.

I remember back in 2010 when then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made her infamous remark about the Affordable Care Act, saying “we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it....” Well the bill has been passed, and now we see what’s in it: An utter mess with incomprehensible rules.

If we compare the assertions the president made about ObamaCare when it was first introduced to the current bill as it has been passed today, we find that all the president’s guarantees regarding ObamaCare are not there.

The truth of the matter is that we were not fully informed. For example, President Obama maintained that this bill would lower the cost of health care, especially in regards to insurance premiums. That is simply not true. Many different analyses clearly show that in some markets, insurance premiums can increase as high as 30 to 40 percent. One of the main reasons for this increase can be attributed to all the hidden taxes that this bill contains, which the insurance industry will likely pass on to consumers.

Another false guarantee given by the administration was that individuals would be able to keep their doctors and current level of service through ObamaCare. Again, this is not true. The so-called insurance exchanges being set up in many states by the federal government will most likely create a non-competitive environment, meaning patients who cannot afford other types of insurance will be forced to buy insurance from the government. And if their current doctors are not willing to participate in that single-payer health care system, these patients will ultimately lose the guarantee of keeping their own doctors.

So what does this all mean? It means that if everything goes according to the president’s plan, the health care landscape is going to completely change over the next decade. A potential scenario is that private doctors will be employees of one large health care system. Health standards such as maintaining an ideal weight and eliminating habits like drinking alcohol and soda will be placed on families so that they can qualify for health care. So in other words, your individual freedom will be targeted.

I know many people argue that it’s better if everyone has health insurance and maintains a healthy lifestyle. Yes it is, but I still believe that an individual’s health care should not be dictated by the government. Instead it should be a choice made by the individual and his or her health provider.

Many senior politicians and consultants have found as of late that ObamaCare is a train wreck. And yet, the person in charge of implementing ObamaCare, United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, continues to drive the train forward. Rather than work with leaders who are suggesting changes ,she has decided to enlist the help of the private sector in getting donations to help fund ObamaCare.

Many have questioned this move, but one thing Secretary Sebelius knows is how to organize her community of followers. Recently, she has teamed up with Nancy-Ann DeParle, former director of the White House Office of Health Reform, placing her in charge of asking insurance companies to donate $1 million or more to Enroll America, a non-profit organization promoting enrollment in the subsidized insurance markets, according to a report from Politico.

You see, folks, ObamaCare is all about politics and control, and to me, that is a formula for disaster. This is something that should not be taken for granted but rather openly evaluated by the American public."

Democrats on Capitol Hill said they were unhappy with the performance of the Obamacare website, which has been plagued with problems since its debut Oct. 1. Even the president’s longtime campaign guru, David Axelrod, was critical of the administration’s handling of the issue.

“This has been shrouded in a little bit of mystery. I don’t quite understand why that is,” Axelrod said in an MSNBC interview this week. He added that if he were at the White House, he would be “very, very tough on the people who are responsible.”

Even those who support the new healthcare law — and its promise of providing affordable insurance coverage to millions of Americans — suggested that aspects of it may need to be postponed unless changes can be put into place quickly. Some were calling on Obama to hold people accountable for the mistakes.

“Somebody’s got to man up here — get rid of these people,” said Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.), who stopped short of calling for the ouster of any specific administration official or contractor but characterized the president’s response to the rollout as “weak.”

“There are people like myself who supported the Affordable Care Act, but I’m not oblivious to the fact that this layout has done harm and damage to the brand,” Nolan said.

Democratic Party leaders also suggested that heads should roll, even while maintaining strong support for Obamacare.

“I absolutely believe that somebody should be held accountable,” said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), the No. 4 Democrat in the House.

Becerra called website problems disturbing, but said, “I think it’s even more disturbing when individuals intentionally work against the American people and the rights that they have now secured to access quality, affordable healthcare.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, in an interview on CNN late Tuesday, would not say whether she and the president had discussed the possibility of her stepping down.

“I think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right,” she said. “And that’s really what I’m focused on.”

At the moment, the White House is not contemplating firing anyone, aides to the president say. Obama is more interested in fixing the problem than in assigning blame, they said.

Frustration among Democrats marked a turning point as the administration scrambled to subdue the mounting anxiety over Obama’s signature achievement.

After years of withstanding Republican efforts to stop Obamacare, the administration now must act quickly to quell concerns from its Democratic partners.

It appears that if improvements aren’t made, several Democratic lawmakers are ready to consider a delay or adjustment in the law’s provisions that all Americans carry insurance by Jan. 1 or face a fine. That idea could gain momentum if Americans are unable to easily use the website to purchase policies soon. Americans can also sign up by phone or in person at certain centers, and those methods have had a smoother debut.

“I don’t know that the answer is to delay the mandate; the answer may be to delay the penalties,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.).

Seeking to tamp down growing concerns, administration officials fanned out on the airwaves and on Capitol Hill to discuss efforts underway to improve the website.

Top officials, including Sebelius, met with health insurance executives from more than a dozen companies and organizations at the White House as part of Obama’s promised “tech surge” to address the issues.

The White House was running two full-scale operations: one to fix the problems and another to reassure consumers and supporters that things will get better.

In the CNN interview, Sebelius tried to deflect criticism from the president, telling interviewer Sanjay Gupta that Obama did not know about the problems with the website before its launch.

But Sebelius was vague about how much other administration officials knew about the site’s readiness before it went live. Problems “became clear fairly early on, the first couple of days,” she said.

Since the rollout of https://www.healthcare.gov this month, the website has been beset with mishaps.

The online marketplace is intended to link uninsured Americans to affordable private insurance plans. But users have had trouble signing on, getting accurate cost estimates and completing enrollment.

Officials have acknowledged that the high volume of visitors — 19 million, Sebelius said — only partly explained the shortcomings. The Health and Human Services Department has not released the number of people who have successfully enrolled in insurance plans.

Republicans, meanwhile, have seized on the glitches as another reason that Obamacare should be scrapped.

In Congress, Republicans have tried repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, to stop the healthcare law, including efforts that recently led to the 16-day federal government shutdown.

“The rollout of Obamacare is nothing short of a debacle and the American people are now fearful of their healthcare,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). “I mean, they’re downright scared about what’s going to happen with their healthcare next year.”

Republicans are bringing the website’s contractors before an oversight committee Thursday to find out what went wrong. They also want to hear from Sebelius, who has agreed to testify next week after declining to appear at this week’s hearing.

A top Obama economic advisor, Jeffrey Zients, was at work after being recruited two days ago to help fix the problems. White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to say how long it would take to have the system running smoothly.

“Each day we’re going to make some progress,” Carney said.

At the same time, Americans’ approval of the Affordable Care Act rose slightly in October, to 45%, according to polling from Gallup. That was up from 41% in August.

Illinois officials under fire for ObamaCare contracts,"Making ObamaCare a reality will require massive computing power to track, store and process the millions of individual cases.

But in Illinois, contracts to compute that state’s cases – valued as high as $190 million – are being awarded without competitive bidding.

The practice already has watchdogs crying foul.

“No transparency and with no bidding -- if that’s legal in Illinois, It shouldn’t be.” said Adam Andrzejewski of openthebooks.com, a watchdog group.

“To the extent that is happening across the country, the citizens need to know it.”

“It has the hallmarks of everything that is Chicago and also Illinois, which is totally imprudent and not the best practices,” says Illinois Republican State Senator Ron Sandack.

Illinois cases are stored and processed in the Medicaid Management Information System or MMIS. The Department of Health and Family Services describes the 30-year-old system as antiquated and needing an upgrade to handle the massive case load expected from ObamaCare.

A company from Gaithersburg, Maryland, Client Network Services Incorporated or CNSI, already has a contract in Michigan to perform similar services.

By forming an alliance with Michigan, Illinois was able to bypass a drawn-out, expensive bidding process because the state procurement code says HFS doesn’t need one if there is an intergovernmental agreement.

“The system can be built in much less time,” wrote Illinois director of HFS, Julie Hamos. “Which is saving taxpayers millions of dollars versus Illinois implementing a much costlier stand-alone system.”

CNSI, however, has encountered problems in other states.

The company sued Louisiana after a contract there was terminated during an investigation into whether CNSI and a handful of other companies violated ethical guidelines during the procurement process.

According to openthebooks.com there were also cost overruns in Washington and Maine and a lawsuit in South Dakota that ended in mediation.

However, the federal government certified CNSI, which was sufficient for Illinois to move forward with the intergovernmental agreement.

“The issues in other states since then do not in any way reflect the technological capabilities and performance Michigan has experienced with CNSI,” wrote director Hamos.

A spokesperson for CNSI said these kinds of partnerships will be part of the future and computing for the Affordable Care Act will be handled in “a cloud” -- meaning cases will be filed in one state, then computed, stored and processed in a mega-computer somewhere else."

The Martin Bashir resignation was a consequence of one of his ‘Clear The Air’ segments. In that segment he was less than kind to Sarah Palin.

Martin Bashir was reacting to Sarah Palin comparing the deficit and Obamacare to slavery. Many on the Right have resorted to equate Obamacare and the deficit to a form of slavery. For descendants of slaves that comparison is obscene. For those empathetic to those affected by the institution of slavery, the comparison is obscene.

Martin Bashir graphically illustrated in his segment a few of the hundreds of dehumanizing events that were imposed on slaves. Sarah Palin had said that “Our free stuff today is being paid for today by taking money from our children and borrowing from China. When that note comes due … it is going to be like slavery when that note is due.”

Martin Bashir response was snarky and graphic. He had had enough. “Given her well established reputation as a world class idiot, it’s hardly surprising that she should choose to mention slavery in a way that is abominable to anyone who knows anything about its barbaric history,” he said.

Martin Bashir then recounted the writings in the diary of Thomas Thistlewood, the son of a tenant farmer. In his diary Thistlewood detailed the “cruel and brutal” punishment inflicted on his slaves. One such brutality involved forcing one slave to defecate in another slave’s mouth. Another cruelty was rubbing salt, pepper, and lime juice into a slave’s wound from flogging.

Martin Bashir then ends his segment saying, ""When Mrs. Palin invokes slavery, she doesn't just prove her rank ignorance. She confirms if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from Thomas Thistlewood, she would be the outstanding candidate.""

Martin Bashir apologized for the segment. It seemed this was not enough for most. His statements continued to haunt him and MSNBC. Martin Bashir decided to resign today. His email follows.



After making an on-air apology, I asked for permission to take some additional time out around the Thanksgiving holiday. Upon further reflection, and after meeting with the President of MSNBC, I have tendered my resignation. It is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues, at this special network, will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill-judged comments. I deeply regret what was said, will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers – who are the smartest, most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences. I would also wish to express deepest gratitude to my immediate colleagues, and our contributors, all of whom have given so much of themselves to our broadcast.

Both the Right and the Left displayed a false sense of indignation over Martin Bashir’s comments. The Right continues to lie, make racist, sexist, misogynistic comments on a daily basis. There is rarely consensus to chop the head of the ones inflicting these ills.

Martin Bashir made a rhetorical statement that was absolutely in line with the liberties and false equivalences Sarah Palin and the Right have been expounding. For that he would not be forgiven. Martin Bashir’s resignation is another Right Wing win over a spineless Left.

But with the IRS’ targeting of conservative non-profits, Republicans are calling into question the agency’s involvement in the application of Obamacare.

On May 23, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) specifically targeted IRS involvement in Obamacare as a rationale for fighting the program:

And here’s another thing we shouldn’t be doing: handing over the administration of Obamacare to these folks. I mean, think about it. A deeply unpopular law being administered by an agency that’s so betrayed the public trust. Even the IRS’ staunchest defenders in this scandal describe their actions as a case of ‘horrible customer service.’ That’s the best they can say: ‘Horrible customer service.’ And now they’re going to be put in charge of a new trillion-dollar program? One that will give them access to all sorts of sensitive, deeply personal information? Well, that’s just what the Administration and congressional Democrats are about to let happen.

McConnell specifically pointed out that the IRS official charged with managing Obamacare was the “very same person who led the division of the IRS now embroiled in scandal – who oversaw the very office now under fire for the discriminatory and harassing behavior.”

McConnell is hardly the only Senator pointing out the nefarious connection between the IRS and Obamacare. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) told Breitbart News, “The president’s entire agenda is based on giving more and more power to the same executive branch agencies that have recently demonstrated themselves to either be criminally incompetent or tyrannically corrupt. Obamacare? Expanded gun background checks? Comprehensive immigration reform? They’re all based on competent collection and ethical use of personal information coerced from the American people by the federal bureaucracy.”

Catherine Frazier, press secretary for Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), agreed: “Everyone should be taken out of the Obamacare business because Obamacare needs to be repealed. The IRS is the very last agency that should be administering any of our laws. Americans have no reason to trust an administration that would engage in, then lie about its partisan, political targeting of Americans based on their personal beliefs.”

“The IRS has acted in this bigoted and un-American a fashion when it was just administering the tax code,” said Ben Sasse, President of Midland University in Nebraska and a person widely perceived to be a possible Senate candidate. “Imagine the range of discrimination possible when it becomes the most important regulatory agency for healthcare, the largest sector of the US economy. Which health offenses become crimes? If a citizen prefers a high-deductible plan, and the bureaucrats object – or if an employer makes paperwork errors – what happens? We are crossing a big threshold here. All defenders of freedom should be in favor of a bright line that prohibits the criminalization of anything related to the purchase of health insurance. The IRS needs to be fixed, not expanded.”

In the House, the opposition is no less pointed. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said to Breitbart News, “The IRS’s future role in ObamaCare is just one of many reasons why this law must be fully repealed. After their outrageous actions and the lack of any accountability – why should any American trust them to involved in their healthcare.”

With a new Gallup poll showing that a full 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the Obama administration’s handling of the IRS scandal, and that 77 percent of Americans think the IRS scandal is either very or somewhat serious, it’s clear that the pushback against Obamacare will center on IRS involvement. And that, in turn, will force President Obama to defend the embattled agency in order to save his flagship program.

Turns out the funny man did hear the GOP’s complaints.

Stewart interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday’s edition of The Daily Show, and he proceeded to both mock and shred her attempt to talk up Obamacare. One almost could feel sorry for an Obama administration official forced to defend the president’s signature train wreck.

Stewart kept his clown nose on for the start of their chat to highlight Obamacare’s deeply flawed web component.

We’re going to do a challenge,” Stewart said at the start of the interview. “I’m going to try and download every movie ever made, and you are going to try to sign up for Obamacare — and we’ll see which happens first.

Ouch. It was almost as if Jay Leno were sitting in Stewart’s chair for a moment.

Stewart wasn’t finished.

If I’m an individual that doesn’t want [Obamacare], it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to,” Stewart said. “Because I would feel like … like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you this year, but you’re not allowing individuals that same courtesy.” Sebelius ducked the question and repeated her talking points. She did that a few more times on his follow-ups, prompting Stewart to say, “Am I a stupid man?

No, just a comedian who too often defends the president for partisan reasons and mocks the one cable news station–Fox News–which holds Obama’s feet to the fire on the latest headlines.

Sadly, many young Americans say they get their “news” from Stewart’s Daily Show. If true, Millennials got a dose of stone cold reality last night."

Phil Gingrey to Sebelius: Prove You Met with President About Obamacare,"In a move sure to spark consternation inside the White House, Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA) sent a letter Tuesday to embattled Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requesting she produce a list of the one-on-one meetings she and President Barack Obama allege to have held in the over three-and-a-half years leading up to Obamacare’s calamitous rollout–meetings that do not appear on the White House’s own official calendar.

“I have been greatly concerned over the lack of transparency and disregard for straight answers,” says Gingrey in his letter to Sebelius. “The Government Accountability Institute reported this month that according to the White House calendar, you have only met with the President once at the White House since becoming Secretary. Yet the White House has disputed the account and claims that you have been briefing the President regularly.”

Last week during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Gingrey, a medical doctor, asked a flustered Sebelius how many one-on-one meetings she had with Obama. “A lot,” replied Sebelius. Gingrey then asked whether she could verify her statement. “I, I…,” Sebelius uttered while flailing her hands. The committee chair then announced that Gingrey’s time for questioning had expired.

Gingrey says in his letter that the American people deserve to know “how the rollout of the healthcare law has been botched so badly, who in the administration knew what, and when officials received warnings of problems.”

Gingrey’s request to Sebelius comes on the heels of an explosive report and Politico Magazine article by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) that found the official White House calendar and the Politico presidential calendar do not record a single one-on-one meeting between the HHS chief and Obama since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010. Only once does Sebelius’s name appear–in a meeting that also included then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner. Curiously, those same calendars record 277 private meetings between Obama and other Cabinet secretaries.

Specifically, Gingrey says he wants Sebelius to answer the following questions:

How many times have you met in-person with the president since the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)?

How many meetings did you have with White House staffers to discuss ACA?

Were issues regarding implementation deadlines discussed? If so, what directions were given?

How many meetings did you have with White House, CMS, and other agency personnel to discuss ACA implementation?

When it became clear that the ACA would not be ready by October 1, who in the White House was briefed? When was he or she briefed? What were they told?

Specifically, did you meet with the president after you received the McKinsey briefing? If yes, did you inform him of the grave warnings outlined? If no, why not?

Gingrey’s last question refers to a critical April 4, 2013 meeting wherein McKinsey & Co. consultants presented a 15-slide presentation to Sebelius and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. The presentation cautioned that the ideal situation for the Obamacare website would include “end-to-end integrated operations and IT testing” and warned that there was “insufficient time and scope of end-to-end testing.”

The Georgia congressman’s letter to Sebelius places the already beleaguered Obama Administration in a difficult and dangerous political quandary that could further erode the president’s already sinking trustworthiness and approval ratings.

During his roundly-criticized November 14 press conference, Obama promised the American people that he was unaware of the HealthCare.gov problems until after the website was launched on October 1. But as GAI President Peter Schweizer pointed out in a Politico Magazine article, “If Obama and Sebelius worked together closely and regularly, why did the president publicly state he did not know about the problems with HealthCare.gov?”

That unanswered question threatens to further unravel Obama’s tenuous standing with Independent voters who tend to base political preferences more on executive performance and leadership traits and less on ideological positions.

Former counselor to four presidents from both parties David Gergen said on CNN that the GAI report and the White House’s refusal to turn over the dates of the alleged one-on-one meetings between Sebelius and Obama suggests that “there was no one in charge in the administration.”

Raul Labrador (R-ID) has officially left the House version of the “Gang of Eight” after Democrats–led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a House aide familiar with the discussions told Breitbart News–went back on a prior agreement-in-principle during the talks.

Originally, according to Labrador, the House group had agreed hat illegal immigrants would be required to cover their own health care costs and not have access to Obamacare. When the talks moved along, though, the Democrats went back on their promise and began insisting that illegal immigrants get access to government healthcare.

That prompted Labrador to abandon the group on Wednesday evening, as the left was not negotiating in good faith, he said. A House aide confirmed to Breitbart News that Pelosi–who was not a member of the House immigration group–was the leader of the charge in pushing health care for illegal immigrants, even though the Democrats in the group had originally agreed to the compromise.

“I have tremendous respect for the members of the bipartisan group who have been working with me to fix our broken immigration system,” Labrador said in a statement. “But after today’s meeting, the framework of the bill has changed in a way that I can no longer support. Like most Americans, I believe that health care is first and foremost a personal responsibility. While I will no longer be part of the bipartisan ‘Group of Eight’ House negotiators, I will not abandon my efforts to modernize our broken immigration system by securing our borders and creating a workable guest worker program. I remain hopeful that the House can pass a bill around these principles and I will keep fighting to make it happen.”

Pelosi’s office has not returned a request for comment from Breitbart News for this story.

Labrador had been working with Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), John Carter (R-TX), Sam Johnson (R-TX), Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and John Yarmuth (D-KY).

Labrador’s move comes on the heels of a report from Breitbart News that a high-ranking Senate aide said Rubio is searching for a way out of the Senate Gang of Eight.

“Rubio and his staff are trying to get out of the Gang of Eight,” the aide said. “They’re looking to use other Republican members as their parachute to get out.”"

(CNN) —

President Barack Obama apologized Thursday to those Americans whose insurance plans are being canceled due to the federal health law he championed even though he said repeatedly they could keep their coverage if they liked.

“I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,” he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.

“We’ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this,” he added.

Obama’s comments come days after he attempted to clarify what he meant when he assured Americans in previous years that they would be able to keep their plans under the Affordable Care Act, a controversy that is prompting legislation in Congress to address it.

Obama further alters ‘you can keep your plan’ pledge

Republicans have hammered Obama over the promise since insurers began discontinuing coverage for some of the 12 million Americans who buy individual policies on the private market that don’t meet Obamacare requirements for more comprehensive care.

GOP moves past troubled Obamacare website

Insurance companies appear to be doing this for a variety of reasons; some are pulling all their plans from certain states where they have fewer subscribers in order to save money.

In many cases, affected policyholders are being squeezed. They either don’t qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of new premiums or they may have to pay more in the health care exchange marketplace.

When Obama says he’s looking to fix it, he primarily means steps that can be taken administratively, senior administration officials said.

Some experts suggest one possible approach would be to ask insurers to delay the cancellation of plans and extend them into the New Year so that people are not left without insurance. That has been done, for example, in the state of California.

But House Speaker John Boehner said an Obama apology was in order and said the Republican-led House had its own plan in mind.

“What Americans want to hear is that the President is going to keep his promise. That’s why the House will vote next week to allow anyone with a health care plan they like to keep it,” Boehner said. “If the President is sincerely sorry that he misled the American people, the very least he can do is support this bipartisan effort. Otherwise, this apology doesn’t amount to anything.”

The administration eventually knew that many policies would be changed by the insurance carriers after Obamacare was introduced, and the associated political uproar since its October 1 online rollout has also angered Democrats and fueled Republican efforts to extend related controversies onto the campaign trail.

Vulnerable Senate Democrats voice concerns

In 2010, the Health and Human Services Department estimated that 40% to 67% of individual plans would eventually lose their “grandfathered” status, which only was conferred if a plan was purchased before the health care law was approved in 2010.

Although Obama said the “buck stops” with him on Obamacare problems to date – including the rocky rollout of the website – he still was resolute that his initiative to provide coverage for the uninsured and better coverage for many others would be better for the country.

“Most of the folks who … got these cancellation letters, they’ll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces,” Obama said, also noting that “we have to make sure” people do not feel as if they’ve been betrayed by an effort carried out with their best interests in mind.

“They’ll have more choice, they’ll have more competition. They’re part of a bigger pool. The insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business. So the majority of folks will end up being better off,” he said.

Key elements of the health law prohibit discrimination for pre-existing conditions and require new plans cover maternity care, mental health and other areas. The program was developed to put comprehensive care within reach of millions of uninsured Americans.

About 95% of legal U.S. residents receive health insurance through private employers or the federal government, the Obama administration says. But more than 48 million Americans don’t have any coverage.

Debunking 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrong

Obama’s apology comes a week after similar refrains were made by Vice President Joe Biden and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius regarding the botched Obamacare online rollout.

WH: Chief tech officer too busy for congressional testimony

Asked if he thinks Americans will be able to trust what he says in the future, Obama said he thinks he’ll ultimately be “judged on whether” Obamacare is better for Americans overall.

“When you try to do something big like make our health care system better … there are going to be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you’re doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off, and I hope that people will look at the end product and they’re going to be able to look back and say, you know what, we now have protections we didn’t have before,” he said.

In the NBC interview, Obama reiterated the administration’s line that he’s “confident” a “majority of people” will be able to use the website and apply for insurance by November 30. But he did not say whether he would push back the March 31 deadline to enroll or the penalty for those who do not purchase insurance.

Obamacare depends on younger, healthier Americans to buy into the program and pay premiums to offset costs for covering older people who need more health care. Those without insurance who do not sign up for a plan face a fine.

What else could go wrong with Obamacare?

A Gallup poll conducted just over a week ago showed 36% of Americans said they didn’t think that in the long run the Affordable Care Act would make much of a difference to their family’s health care situation. Just over a third said the health care law would make matters worse, and one in four said that Obamacare would make things better.

Opinion: Here’s the truth about Obamacare

But with the IRS’ targeting of conservative non-profits, Republicans are calling into question the agency’s involvement in the application of Obamacare.

On May 23, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) specifically targeted IRS involvement in Obamacare as a rationale for fighting the program:

And here’s another thing we shouldn’t be doing: handing over the administration of Obamacare to these folks. I mean, think about it. A deeply unpopular law being administered by an agency that’s so betrayed the public trust. Even the IRS’ staunchest defenders in this scandal describe their actions as a case of ‘horrible customer service.’ That’s the best they can say: ‘Horrible customer service.’ And now they’re going to be put in charge of a new trillion-dollar program? One that will give them access to all sorts of sensitive, deeply personal information? Well, that’s just what the Administration and congressional Democrats are about to let happen.

McConnell specifically pointed out that the IRS official charged with managing Obamacare was the “very same person who led the division of the IRS now embroiled in scandal – who oversaw the very office now under fire for the discriminatory and harassing behavior.”

McConnell is hardly the only Senator pointing out the nefarious connection between the IRS and Obamacare. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) told Breitbart News, “The president’s entire agenda is based on giving more and more power to the same executive branch agencies that have recently demonstrated themselves to either be criminally incompetent or tyrannically corrupt. Obamacare? Expanded gun background checks? Comprehensive immigration reform? They’re all based on competent collection and ethical use of personal information coerced from the American people by the federal bureaucracy.”

Catherine Frazier, press secretary for Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), agreed: “Everyone should be taken out of the Obamacare business because Obamacare needs to be repealed. The IRS is the very last agency that should be administering any of our laws. Americans have no reason to trust an administration that would engage in, then lie about its partisan, political targeting of Americans based on their personal beliefs.”

“The IRS has acted in this bigoted and un-American a fashion when it was just administering the tax code,” said Ben Sasse, President of Midland University in Nebraska and a person widely perceived to be a possible Senate candidate. “Imagine the range of discrimination possible when it becomes the most important regulatory agency for healthcare, the largest sector of the US economy. Which health offenses become crimes? If a citizen prefers a high-deductible plan, and the bureaucrats object – or if an employer makes paperwork errors – what happens? We are crossing a big threshold here. All defenders of freedom should be in favor of a bright line that prohibits the criminalization of anything related to the purchase of health insurance. The IRS needs to be fixed, not expanded.”

In the House, the opposition is no less pointed. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said to Breitbart News, “The IRS’s future role in ObamaCare is just one of many reasons why this law must be fully repealed. After their outrageous actions and the lack of any accountability – why should any American trust them to involved in their healthcare.”

With a new Gallup poll showing that a full 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the Obama administration’s handling of the IRS scandal, and that 77 percent of Americans think the IRS scandal is either very or somewhat serious, it’s clear that the pushback against Obamacare will center on IRS involvement. And that, in turn, will force President Obama to defend the embattled agency in order to save his flagship program.

Sen. Menendez contacted top officials in friend’s Medicare dispute

Sen. Robert Menendez raised concerns with top federal health-care officials twice in recent years about their finding that a Florida eye doctor — a close friend and major campaign donor — had overbilled the government by $8.9 million for care at his clinic, Menendez aides said Wednesday.

Menendez (D-N.J.) initially contacted federal officials in 2009 about the government’s audit of Salomon Melgen, complaining to the director overseeing Medicare payments that it was unfair to penalize the doctor because the billing rules were ambiguous, the aides said.

Last year, in a meeting with the acting administrator of the agency in charge of Medicare and Medicaid, Menendez again questioned whether federal auditors had been fair in their assessment of Melgen’s billing for eye injections to treat macular degeneration, the senator’s aides said.

The agency had ordered Melgen to repay the $8.9 million, and at the time of both conversations, Melgen was disputing the agency’s conclusion. His appeal continues to this day.

Menendez’s office provided this account of his contacts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after The Washington Post asked about the role he had played in the long-standing dispute between Melgen and the agency over his billing practices.

Menendez, who became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month, is under scrutiny because of his close relationship with Melgen. The doctor donated more than $700,000 last year to Menendez’s reelection campaign and other Senate Democrats. And when Melgen needed help with a port security contract in the Dominican Republic last year, Menendez urged U.S. officials to press the country to carry out the multimillion-dollar agreement.

Menendez is facing a Senate ethics inquiry about two free trips he took in 2010 on Melgen’s private plane to the doctor’s seaside mansion in the Dominican Republic. Menendez acknowledged this month that he had not properly disclosed the trips. He wrote a personal check for $58,500 to reimburse Melgen.

Meanwhile, a federal investigation of what law enforcement officials say are allegations of health-care fraud by Melgen escalated last week when FBI agents and health-care investigators raided medical offices in West Palm Beach where he runs Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. The teams spent nearly 24 hours searching the premises and removing dozens of boxes containing billing and medical records and computer files.

Federal investigators and health-care auditors have had concerns about Melgen’s billing practices at various times over the past decade, two former federal officials said. In part, they have examined the volume of eye injections, surgeries and laser treatments performed at his West Palm Beach clinic.

But a Menendez aide said Wednesday that the senator did not know Melgen was under formal investigation for possible fraud until the well-publicized raid last week.

“Senator Menendez was never aware of and has not intervened in any Medicare fraud investigation on behalf of Vitreo Retinal Consultants,” his office said in a statement.

The senator’s conversation with federal officials about Melgen’s case was unrelated to the current investigation, Menendez aides said.

“On a separate issue regarding Medicare reimbursement, he has in the past raised concerns with CMS about conflicting guidelines and ambiguity in CMS rules that are difficult for providers to understand and can lead to judgments after the fact,” the statement said. “His interest was in making sure providers were not penalized if CMS clarified or changed the rules of the game retroactively.”

Alan Reider, Melgen’s attorney, said Wednesday that his client has returned the government money in dispute but is contesting the CMS audit finding so he can reclaim the money. Reider said Melgen believes he was following Medicare guidelines. Reider added that Melgen was not aware that his practice was under investigation until federal agents arrived at his clinic last week.

At issue in the reimbursement dispute is Melgen’s multiple use of individual vials for eye injections to treat macular degeneration. Federal auditors have said Melgen often billed the government three to four times for injections from a single vial, according to two federal officials and lawyers familiar with the case.

The government’s Medicare program reimburses providers $2,000 for each vial, so Melgen was billing $6,000 to $8,000 for each vial.

Melgen’s attorneys said the doctor was properly billing for treating four patients with medical injections, albeit from one vial.

After CMS ruled in 2008 that Melgen would have to repay the government, he and his legal representatives contacted Menendez’s office, arguing that the finding was unfair, the senator’s aides said. Menendez’s staff members had several conversations with agency officials to learn more about the billing rules and the details of Melgen’s case in particular, the aides said.

In July 2009, Menendez called Jonathan Blum, the Medicare director at CMS, to express concern, the aides said. Menendez brought up Melgen’s case, they said, in the context of broader concerns about the guidelines.

Then, in June 2012, Menendez raised Melgen’s case again at a meeting with CMS Acting Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, aides recounted. They said the primary subject of the meeting was the implementation of President Obama’s health-care overhaul.

The aides said Menendez never urged the CMS to take specific action on Melgen’s case.

Blum and Tavenner declined to comment through a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.

Melgen frequently cited his connection to Menendez, according to two former federal officials and doctors in South Florida.

When federal health-care fraud investigators were questioning him several years ago about his billing practices, he invoked the senator’s name, the former officials said.

“He used Menendez’s name all the time. He would say, “Menendez is a good friend of mine, and he knows I never did anything wrong,’ ” said a former senior federal official familiar with the investigation.

In Florida, it was more threatening, several doctors in the South Florida region recounted. After one local eye surgeon criticized Melgen’s treatment methods in discussions with other Florida doctors, Melgen warned that he had important friends in the Senate, including Menendez, said two doctors familiar with the exchange. They said Melgen cautioned that his Washington friends could arrange an intensive federal audit of the surgeon’s practice.

Reider, the attorney, said he had no knowledge of any comments Melgen may have made mentioning his friendship to Menendez.

Melgen came to the attention of fraud investigators amid complaints from other local eye doctors alleging that his treatments were often unnecessary, a waste of money and sometimes harmful to patients’ eyesight, the two former federal officials and several doctors said.

At the same time, investigators considered him an “outlier” compared with his peers because of the volume of his billing and the rate at which he administered eye injections and performed procedures on government-insured patients, the former officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still ongoing.

Melgen “was somebody who consistently showed up on the radar and was being looked at quite a bit,” said a former senior health-care fraud investigator. “The sheer volume itself is going to keep him on the radar.’’

When federal investigators interviewed Melgen, he tried to exert pressure on them by mentioning the names of Menendez and other influential politicians, the former fraud investigator said. “We thought it was odd because Menendez was in New Jersey and this guy was in Florida,’’ the official said.

A second former federal official recounted that Menendez’s name came up repeatedly when Melgen was interviewed by investigators from the Justice Department and the inspector general’s office at the Department of Health and Human Services.

“He was using Menendez more as a character reference,” the official said. “He thought he was untouchable.”

The federal interest in Melgen stretches back 10 years, when investigators interviewed Philip Rosenfeld, a nationally known retina specialist, about the volume of treatments Melgen was performing, said several eye doctors in South Florida.

These doctors said Rosenfeld, who pioneered the use of Avastin injections for macular degeneration to stem eyesight loss, had long been troubled by Melgen’s methods.

FBI agents recently interviewed Rosenfeld again, this time two days before they raided Melgen’s clinic, the doctors said.

Reached at his home in Key Biscayne, Rosenfeld declined to comment.

Doctors in south Florida said that they have been fearful of criticizing Melgen publicly, and that his Washington connections may be protecting him.

In 2010, Melgen scolded eye surgeon Randy Katz for publicly criticizing the quality of his care. According to two fellow doctors, Melgen cited his Senate connections and told Katz that he could face a Medicare investigation.

Katz did not respond to requests for comment. Melgen’s attorney declined to discuss his client’s conversations with Katz or allegations that his client had threatened other doctors.

Soon after the encounter, according to a copy of a letter obtained by The Post, Katz wrote to Palm Beach doctors in praise of Melgen.

“It has come to my attention that certain statements I made have been misunderstood as criticisms of Dr. Melgen,” Katz wrote in the open letter. “To be clear, I know Dr. Salomon Melgen to be a capable and

highly-skilled vitreo-retinal surgeon. . . . If you hear any suggestion that I have said otherwise, you should disregard that suggestion as being false.”

Follow Her On Twitter']",Celebrities who promoted ObamaCare now quiet in wake of website debacle,"In the heady days after the October 1 launch of the Affordable Care Act -- better known as ObamaCare -- Lady Gaga, Amy Poehler, Nina Dobrev, Rosario Dawson, Sarah Silverman, Olivia Wilde, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Hudson, Pearl Jam, Lance Bass, John Legend, Alyssa Milano and Kerry Washington joined the President to encourage Americans to #getcovered.

Since then, technical glitches and website snafus have so marred the ObamaCare website that the team who built it has been called to testify before Congress on Thursday. But there will be no celebrities flanking them on Capitol Hill, as the stars that helped launch the initiative are now being advised to walk away.

One well-placed Hollywood agent told FOX411 that while Obama and ObamaCare are separate issues, and that you can support one without the other, public relations teams across the industry are cautioning their clients to now lay off the latter. Even Oprah Winfrey, one of the President’s most influential mouthpieces during his first election, reportedly refused to get on-board and lend a hand.

“Hollywood has gone from pushing #getcovered to heading for cover,” Dan Gainor, VP of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center told FOX411. “Stars like Lady Gaga and Sarah Silverman pushed their ObamaCare propaganda to more than 67 million fans on social media. But don’t expect them to be honest about the situation.”

Georgia attorney Patrick Millsaps, who served as chief of staff of Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign and manages several Hollywood names, said celebrities, like most public figures, know where to draw the line.

“They are starting to realize they too were sold a bill of goods and aren’t going to be accomplices in a continued fraud,” he said. “This is an easy decision for a manager – you can’t let your client promote a crappy product.”

“Many of my Hollywood friends still believe in this guy,” Millsaps added. “But I think their faith is being tested.”

Publicist Ronn Torossian of 5WPR agreed. “When things go wrong, naturally celebrities won’t want to be outspoken. But don’t expect them to be quiet for long,” he said. “They will stand up again as soon as President Obama asks them to.”

Enter Scarlett Johansson. One of President Obama’s best celebrity friends (she revealed during his campaign that the two were text buddies), Johansson has lent her voice to a Planned Parenthood message that’s played when calls are placed to some of their health centers. “Did you know you may be able to enroll in new, more affordable health insurance plans?” Johansson asks before directing callers to a Planned Parenthood section on the new Affordable Care Act website.

Whether callers can get through to that web address is, obviously, another issue."

Obama’s unconstitutional steps worse than Nixon’s

President Obama’s increasingly grandiose claims for presidential power are inversely proportional to his shriveling presidency. Desperation fuels arrogance as, barely 200 days into the 1,462 days of his second term, his pantry of excuses for failure is bare, his domestic agenda is nonexistent and his foreign policy of empty rhetorical deadlines and red lines is floundering. And at last week’s news conference he offered inconvenience as a justification for illegality.

Explaining his decision to unilaterally rewrite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), he said: “I didn’t simply choose to” ignore the statutory requirement for beginning in 2014 the employer mandate to provide employees with health care. No, “this was in consultation with businesses.”

He continued: “In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law. . . . It looks like there may be some better ways to do this, let’s make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do. But we’re not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to Obamacare. We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so.”

Serving as props in the scripted charade of White House news conferences, journalists did not ask the pertinent question: “Where does the Constitution confer upon presidents the ‘executive authority’ to ignore the separation of powers by revising laws?” The question could have elicited an Obama rarity: brevity. Because there is no such authority.

Obama’s explanation began with an irrelevancy. He consulted with businesses before disregarding his constitutional duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” That duty does not lapse when a president decides Washington’s “political environment” is not “normal.”

When was it “normal”? The 1850s? The 1950s? Washington has been the nation’s capital for 213 years; Obama has been here less than nine. Even if he understood “normal” political environments here, the Constitution is not suspended when a president decides the “environment” is abnormal.

Neither does the Constitution confer on presidents the power to rewrite laws if they decide the change is a “tweak” not involving the law’s “essence.” Anyway, the employer mandate is essential to the ACA.

Twenty-three days before his news conference, the House voted 264 to 161, with 35 Democrats in the majority, for the rule of law — for, that is, the Authority for Mandate Delay Act. It would have done lawfully what Obama did by ukase. He threatened to veto this use of legislation to alter a law. The White House called it “unnecessary,” presumably because he has an uncircumscribed “executive authority” to alter laws.

In a 1977 interview with Richard Nixon, David Frost asked: “Would you say that there are certain situations . . . where the president can decide that it’s in the best interests of the nation . . . and do something illegal?”

Nixon: “Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

Frost: “By definition.”

Nixon: “Exactly, exactly.”

Nixon’s claim, although constitutionally grotesque, was less so than the claim implicit in Obama’s actions regarding the ACA. Nixon’s claim was confined to matters of national security or (he said to Frost) “a threat to internal peace and order of significant magnitude.” Obama’s audacity is more spacious; it encompasses a right to disregard any portion of any law pertaining to any subject at any time when the political “environment” is difficult.

Obama should be embarrassed that, by ignoring the legal requirement concerning the employer mandate, he has validated critics who say the ACA cannot be implemented as written. What does not embarrass him is his complicity in effectively rewriting the ACA for the financial advantage of self-dealing members of Congress and their staffs.

The ACA says members of Congress (annual salaries: $174,000) and their staffs (thousands making more than $100,000) must participate in the law’s insurance exchanges. It does not say that when this change goes into effect, the current federal subsidy for this affluent cohort — up to 75 percent of the premium’s cost, perhaps $10,000 for families — should be unchanged.

When Congress awakened to what it enacted, it panicked: This could cause a flight of talent, making Congress less wonderful. So Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management, which has no power to do this, to authorize for the political class special subsidies unavailable for less privileged and less affluent citizens.

If the president does it, it’s legal? “Exactly, exactly.”

She says Obama prefers a ""no-drama"" White House in which people stay in their lanes Staffers are not encouraged to bring the President bad news, she says Borger: There was no rollout czar for Obamacare; everyone stayed in their silo

(CNN) —

As the story of the Obamacare website fiasco unfolds, senior administration aides tell me that the President is “mad, frustrated and angry.”

Mad that his signature legislative achievement is stuck at the gate, frustrated that he’s running out of time to fix it and angry that he’s got a second-term agenda now going nowhere. He’s so furious, in fact, that he stepped out of character to vent to an assembled group of top aides, saying he would have delayed the website if he had known it was a mess.

By Thursday, the president was venting publicly. “Had I been informed, I wouldn’t be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great. You know, I’m accused of a lot of things, but I don’t think I’m stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity, a week before the website opens, if I thought that it wasn’t going to work.”

All of which begs the real question: How could he not have known?

It’s a real head-scratcher. Most powerful man in the world. Most important issue. Most politically explosive, particularly coming on the heels of the government shutdown. Consider the context: Republicans had just tried to defund Obamacare, and they lost in a heap of public humiliation. So the rollout of Obamacare had to be really impressive, because the Republicans had to be proven wrong.

CNN Gloria Borger

And yet, as the dry runs continued to produce red flags – over and over – the President remained in his steely cocoon. If this were the presidency of George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan, the obvious theories would abound: The chief executive is disengaged. Or incurious. Or worse. But since Obama is none of the above, what gives?

This much is clear, after speaking with both past and present senior administration officials: No one was really in charge, so no one knew for sure how bad the overall picture was. What’s more, and – perhaps most telling – no one wanted even to hint to the President that this techno-savvy administration possibly had a website stuck in, say, 1995. “People don’t like to tell him bad news,” says an ex-White House staffer. “Part of it is the no-drama culture.”

Oh, that. The infamous no-drama Obama credo: no panic, no drama. “No drama is attractive to people, except there are times when people actually should light their hair on fire,” says one former senior administration official. “That would have been a very good thing.”

Indeed. People who have served in top jobs at the White House seem to agree on one thing: a President who wants to get at the truth has to understand the extent of his own isolation. And then establish a zone of immunity for truth-tellers.

That, of course, presumes that the top staff inside the White House knew the full truth. And that probably wasn’t the case. Again, you ask, how can that be? Answer: The operation resembled the proverbial blind men and the elephant parable: Everyone seemed to touch a part of it, but no one could really see the whole picture, or disaster coming right at them.

“It’s not that someone had an envelope with a note in it saying here comes the second-term crisis,” an ex-top White House staffer says. “They were thinking there were some bugs, they would be fixed; these are smart people.”

They may be smart, but it appears they had no singular leader. No rollout czar. They had health care wonks and tech wonks and political wonks and even a presidential wonk, but no put-it-all-together-and-make-sure-it-all-works wonks.

And maybe, no truth-telling wonks, who would have warned the president that it was a no-no to promise that people could keep their health care policies.

Everyone, it seems, lived in his own silo. And that’s where they stayed.

This is a President, says one admirer, “who likes everyone to stay in his lane.” Which begs the question: Whose lane was it to say the website wasn’t working? The probability is that the information filtered to a bunch of different people in a bunch of different lanes.

Sure, the stay-in-your-lane theory of operation is important to a well-run White House, but here’s the flip side if it’s implemented too literally: If you hear something outside your purview that is bad, you may not want to report it higher. Why? “Everyone thinks if it isn’t in my lane, and I talk about it, I’m being a tattletale,” says one ex-administration official. “That would be discouraged as bad behavior in this current White House.” (An exception, some point out, ex-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who “encouraged people to contradict each other.” To put it mildly, Rahm was pro-drama.)

Which brings us to the President, who isn’t. And if you aren’t 100% sure that the website is a mess – because no one is actually in charge to tell the White House with any certainty – what is there to bring to the President? Reports of some bad tests? Bugs? Fixes that are being made?

“Nobody is trying to create drama, angst and anxiety,” says an ex-White House official. “And it’s hard to go in there and say, ‘Well, I don’t think this is going to work.’ ”

So, the irony. All the effort to spare the drama created a huge theatrical mess all of its own. The reviews are lousy, and now the unhappy leading man is stewing, centerstage.

McDonald III, the current president of the pharmacy: “Two days after that final audit was issued, Barbara J. McDonald, your mother and president of Marra’s Pharmacy, wrote Governor Cuomo in an attempt to have him intervene in your dispute with O.M.I.G.”

“After your mother’s letter to Gov. Cuomo,” the letter continued, “O.M.I.G. further reduced the findings of Medicaid overpayments.” The agency eventually settled for $268,000.

Mr. McDonald, formerly the mayor of Cohoes and now a Democratic state assemblyman, said Friday he was happy to cooperate and provide the voluminous file showing why his family had fought the audit, eventually suing the state, and why the amount had been reduced. “We’ll be even happier when they review it and realize there was nothing wrong,” he said.

Far from receiving favoritism, he said, his small pharmacy was almost destroyed by an unforgiving government bureaucracy and is now being swept into a politicized inquiry. Medicaid requires prescriptions to be kept for six years so the government can verify that its payments are justified, but his mother mistakenly believed they could be destroyed after five, and did so. The audit sample showed 30 prescriptions missing. Auditors estimated the pharmacy had been improperly reimbursed by Medicaid by at least $1.4 million, an extrapolation technique used by James Sheehan, then the Medicaid inspector, that providers protested.

“My mother is 78,” Mr. McDonald said. “She’s devoted her life to the pharmacy.”

A second letter from the committee went to John Navarra, owner of Town Total Nutrition Inc. in Manhattan, which had been overpaid through Medicaid by more than $10 million, according to a 2007 preliminary audit. After it was disputed, the inspector general repeatedly reduced the recovery demand, eventually settling for $521,291, less than 5 percent of the initial finding."

According to The Hill, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in favor of two Catholic brothers, Francis and Philip Gilardi, who own a 400-person produce company based in Ohio. The Gilardis argued that they oppose contraception due to the tenets of their Catholic faith, and challenged ObamaCare’s provision that requires them to provide free contraception to their employees through a health insurance plan.

The brothers claimed that if they chose not to obey the law, they would incur a $14 million fine.

A requirement that companies cover their employees’ contraception, the court ruled, is unduly burdensome for business owners who oppose birth control on religious grounds, though they may not be purchasing contraception directly.

The Obama administration argued that the requirement is necessary to protect women’s right to decide whether and when to have children. It is expected the Supreme Court will ultimately pick up the administration’s appeal and make a final decision on its constitutionality.

“The burden on religious exercise does not occur at the point of contraceptive purchase; instead, it occurs when a company’s owners fill the basket of goods and services that constitute a healthcare plan,” wrote Judge Janice Rogers Brown on behalf of the court. “It is clear the government has failed to demonstrate how such a right – whether described as noninterference, privacy, or autonomy – can extend to the compelled subsidization of a woman’s procreative practices.”

Brown added that denying coverage of contraception would not undermine the Affordable Care Act’s requirements that health insurance provide preventative care. The Gilardis’ employees will still be covered for counseling, screenings, and tests, the judge observed.

“The provision of these services — even without the contraceptive mandate — by and large fulfills the statutory command for insurers to provide gender-specific preventive care,” Brown wrote. “At the very least, the statutory scheme will not go to pieces.”

The two judges on the panel who dissented said the rights of religious people do not extend to the companies they own."

Whatever value there is in judging a politician's standings in late December, it's limited. In today's hyper-kinetic Washington politics, conventional wisdom changes -- and quickly. And yet, in talking with operatives, Capitol Hill aides, Washington observers, and others, one impression is more permanent than any other: President Barack Obama had a really bad, tough-to-spin 2013.

It was, as conceded by David Axelrod, the president's longtime adviser, a ""crappy year.""

It's not just the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act. To review: Obama worked Congress hard on gun control measures. It failed. He was hands-off with Congress on immigration reform. It failed. He pushed to avert sequestration cuts. They were enacted. He argued for unemployment benefits to be extended. They weren't. Revelations of aggressive investigations into national security leaks led to a review of Justice Department activities. Revelations that the IRS had screened tea party groups led to a reworking of the tax agency's practices. Revelations of the National Security Agency's broad surveillance programs, endorsed by Obama, led to popular revulsion, a court rebuke, another review, and likely reforms.

That a government shutdown gave the president one of his better moments says something about the year. Shortly after the October standoff was resolved, with polls showing a majority blamed Republicans, the anti-Obama dam broke. The ACA rollout was a disaster, and a signature promise of the program that Obama made himself was proven hollow.

At his year-end press conference Friday, Obama declined to call it the worst year of his presidency.

""I have now been in office five years, close to five years, was running for president for two years before that, and for those who've covered me during that time, we have had ups and we have had downs,"" he said. ""I think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.""



As proof that his rumored demise may be premature, Obama noted recent legislative activity and the prospect of a continued thaw. Obama's defenders, meanwhile, argued that some 2013 setbacks should be placed in context. The IRS ""scandal"" lost fizz when it became clear that the agency had screened progressive groups, too. Sequestration relief was passed during the year-end budget deal. Even the stalled immigration reform effort has an upside.

""We actually aren’t quite as gloomy about this year,"" said Matt Bennett, senior vice president for public affairs and a co-founder of the centrist-Democratic group Third Way. ""Yes, the ACA rollout was very rocky. But if they get their act fully together on that, he may be in for a more productive year in 2014 than many expect. He got a really good immigration bill out of the Senate, and there is hope in the House once the primary filing deadlines pass. ... We actually made some headway on gun safety -- getting a vote on final passage and a handful of Republicans is nothing to sneeze at. So we see a few green shoots. Of course, we don’t yet know if they are flowers or weeds.""

But even when taking those green shoots into account, it's impossible to argue that Obama has been on a course he's enjoyed. The charts don't lie.

The more pertinent question (one whose answer has implications for the years ahead) is whether to blame personal missteps and mismanagement, or unforeseen events and structural problems with the political system?

For Axelrod, the president and his team aren't entirely blameless. Part of the damage was ""self-inflicted,"" including the ""atrocious rollout of the health care website,"" he said. But broader issues outside of Obama's control were more determinative.

""The fact is you start out wanting to talk about and work on one set of issues and then events drag you to other places,"" Axelrod said, pointing to the Newtown shootings and Syrian civil war as examples. ""That is really the story of this year. ... A lot of it has to do with random events and orchestrated subversion on the part of the opposition.""

Certainly, there were moments during the year when the president was forced off of his agenda. White House officials had planned a big jobs-related legislative push in January, for example, before the docket was overwhelmed by gun control. Other Democrats argued that the kinks of the political system did Obama in, with Republicans rewarded above all else for obstinacy.

""No White House is perfect and everyone makes mistakes, but I do think the structural problems overwhelmed everything else because it just became apparent that nothing could happen,"" said Bennett. ""The degree of dysfunction was historic. ... He could have been Lincoln in 1863 and he wouldn't have been able to do anything.""

But Republican obstruction isn't exactly new. Nor is the notion that the news cycle is unwieldy and difficult to control. Other Democrats were sympathetic to the president, but more inclined to say that Obama and his team were responsible for the mess.

Mike Lux, who served as Obama's liaison to the progressive community during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon. When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not necessarily heeded.

""I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,"" said Lux. ""In advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn't seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion in the party and with progressive allies.""

A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: ""These guys are stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn't smell, that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt them.""

As for policy, insularity has become the enemy of originality, Lux argued. That's led to an administration too comfortable with conventional wisdom. The president didn't challenge the intelligence community over the surveillance programs, and he made back room deals that complicated the health care law unnecessarily.

What's ironic, others said, is that Obama is more comfortable as president now than at any point since he was elected. Drew Westen, a professor at Emory University, famously criticized Obama in 2011 on the op-ed pages of The New York Times for acquiescing too much to his opponents and for uninspiring oratory.

Today, Westen praises Obama for increasingly relying on executive actions. If he were to grade Obama, he said he'd give him higher marks than ""in all his prior years."" Where Obama's administration has been tripped up, he argued, has been in a failure to elevate issues and messages that matter.

""There were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying, 'You have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care, but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks, protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about,'"" said Westen ""That stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009. Where I would fault him now is that I think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election.""

A request for comment from the White House was not returned. But it seems clear already that Obama and his team see value in Westen's point. In recent weeks, the administration has begun focusing on income inequality, wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth. Aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed.

""The core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class,"" said one former White House official. ""The question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes. My answer: maybe not significantly, but somewhat.""

And then there is the Occam's razor view of what went wrong. Had the Affordable Care Act's rollout not been so badly botched, the year-end retrospective would have been kinder.

Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Vermont governor, argued as much when asked for his assessment. Every president who wins a second term suffers setbacks during his fifth year in office, Dean noted. And in all cases, the problems confronting Obama had to do either with a policy that he pushed or a personal decision that he made.

""It wasn't a policy issue, it was a digital problem,"" Dean said. ""He is in trouble because of the website.""

And for that reason, there is hope for a bounce in 2014.

""I would argue that if he didn't have the website collapse, he wouldn't be subjected to the five-year curse as much,"" said Dean. ""All the other five-year curses were of the sitting president's own making. This one you may argue that three people down the line screwed up the website, not Obama. ... I do not think that he has been personally stained the way the other presidents were.""

He Began His Column With The Post In', 'He Received The Pulitzer Prize For Commentary In His Latest Book', 'The Conservative Sensibility', 'Was Released In June']",George Will: Obama’s unconstitutional steps worse than Nixon’s,"President Obama’s increasingly grandiose claims for presidential power are inversely proportional to his shriveling presidency. Desperation fuels arrogance as, barely 200 days into the 1,462 days of his second term, his pantry of excuses for failure is bare, his domestic agenda is nonexistent and his foreign policy of empty rhetorical deadlines and red lines is floundering. And at last week’s news conference he offered inconvenience as a justification for illegality.

Explaining his decision to unilaterally rewrite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), he said: “I didn’t simply choose to” ignore the statutory requirement for beginning in 2014 the employer mandate to provide employees with health care. No, “this was in consultation with businesses.”

He continued: “In a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn’t go to the essence of the law. . . . It looks like there may be some better ways to do this, let’s make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do. But we’re not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to Obamacare. We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so.”

Serving as props in the scripted charade of White House news conferences, journalists did not ask the pertinent question: “Where does the Constitution confer upon presidents the ‘executive authority’ to ignore the separation of powers by revising laws?” The question could have elicited an Obama rarity: brevity. Because there is no such authority.

Obama’s explanation began with an irrelevancy. He consulted with businesses before disregarding his constitutional duty to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” That duty does not lapse when a president decides Washington’s “political environment” is not “normal.”

When was it “normal”? The 1850s? The 1950s? Washington has been the nation’s capital for 213 years; Obama has been here less than nine. Even if he understood “normal” political environments here, the Constitution is not suspended when a president decides the “environment” is abnormal.

Neither does the Constitution confer on presidents the power to rewrite laws if they decide the change is a “tweak” not involving the law’s “essence.” Anyway, the employer mandate is essential to the ACA.

Twenty-three days before his news conference, the House voted 264 to 161, with 35 Democrats in the majority, for the rule of law — for, that is, the Authority for Mandate Delay Act. It would have done lawfully what Obama did by ukase. He threatened to veto this use of legislation to alter a law. The White House called it “unnecessary,” presumably because he has an uncircumscribed “executive authority” to alter laws.

In a 1977 interview with Richard Nixon, David Frost asked: “Would you say that there are certain situations . . . where the president can decide that it’s in the best interests of the nation . . . and do something illegal?”

Nixon: “Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”

Frost: “By definition.”

Nixon: “Exactly, exactly.”

Nixon’s claim, although constitutionally grotesque, was less so than the claim implicit in Obama’s actions regarding the ACA. Nixon’s claim was confined to matters of national security or (he said to Frost) “a threat to internal peace and order of significant magnitude.” Obama’s audacity is more spacious; it encompasses a right to disregard any portion of any law pertaining to any subject at any time when the political “environment” is difficult.

Obama should be embarrassed that, by ignoring the legal requirement concerning the employer mandate, he has validated critics who say the ACA cannot be implemented as written. What does not embarrass him is his complicity in effectively rewriting the ACA for the financial advantage of self-dealing members of Congress and their staffs.

The ACA says members of Congress (annual salaries: $174,000) and their staffs (thousands making more than $100,000) must participate in the law’s insurance exchanges. It does not say that when this change goes into effect, the current federal subsidy for this affluent cohort — up to 75 percent of the premium’s cost, perhaps $10,000 for families — should be unchanged.

When Congress awakened to what it enacted, it panicked: This could cause a flight of talent, making Congress less wonderful. So Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management, which has no power to do this, to authorize for the political class special subsidies unavailable for less privileged and less affluent citizens.

If the president does it, it’s legal? “Exactly, exactly.”

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/11/Sebelius,2013-12-11 00:00:00,['Wynton Hall'],Sebelius Flustered After Question About One-on-One Obama Meetings,"Embattled Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius appeared flustered during Wednesday testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee as she struggled to answer questions about an explosive Politico Magazine report written by Government Accountability Institute President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer.

The report revealed the White House calendar records a single one-on-one meeting between her and President Barack Obama in over three-and-a-half years.

“How many times did you actually visit with the President since 2009 or 2010 when you came on board?” asked Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is also a medical doctor. “How many personal visits did you have with him at the White House regarding the Affordable Care Act?”

“A lot,” said Sebelius.

“Can you verify that?” asked Gingrey.

The chair then said, “The Gentleman’s time has expired.”

“I, I…,” a flustered Sebelius said while raising her hands in the air.

The GAI’s report and Schweizer’s Politico Magazine op-ed revealed the White House’s official calendar and the Politico presidential calendar list just a single meeting between Obama and Sebelius from July 12, 2010 to November 30, 2013. On Friday, HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters released a statement claiming that Sebelius and Obama held “countless” one-on-one meetings together and that “dozens” of those private meetings were held in the last year alone.

Similarly, when asked by NBC News reporter Peter Alexander and ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl about the GAI’s explosive report, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney claimed Sebelius has one-on-one meetings with Obama “frequently” and that “it’s safe to say that Kathleen Sebelius has been one of the more frequent visitors to and attendants to meetings with the president.

However, Carney admitted to Jonathan Karl that he had no numbers, figures, or dates of meetings but said, “I think on this case, they’ll [HHS] have information for you.” But today during her testimony, Sebelius could only answer, “A lot,” when questioned how many times she had met with the president. And HHS spokesperson Joanne Peters has yet to release the “countless” and “dozens” of dates she claims Obama and Sebelius met one-on-one over the last three-and-a-half years leading up to the Obamacare rollout.

Analysts say the GAI report hits at the core question of presidential leadership and executive management, traits that when damaged can do significant damage to a president’s popularity, especially among Independent voters. Former White House adviser to four presidents of both parties, David Gergen, said on CNN that the GAI’s report demonstrated “malfeasance” by the Obama White House. “The fact that he was not meeting with her one-on-one, I think, frankly, is not so much an indictment of her but of the White House operation,” said Gergen. “At the same time three years pass with no one-on-one meetings according to this Politico article. The president had 277 one-on-one meetings with other members of his cabinet.”

Other GOP committee members expressed frustration with Sebelius for what they considered evasive and misleading answers.

“We just don’t get the truth out of you!” Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL) said to Sebelius. “It’s like talking to the Republic of Korea.”

Democrats on the committee like Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) laughed off Republican criticisms of Obamacare and said GOP concerns over millions of American families receiving insurance cancellations proves Republicans are “living on Mars.” Pallone added: “The reality is the Affordable Care Act is working…I’m proud of this law.”

“Republicans are afraid this law is going to be popular,” said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA).

Obama claims he was never notified of problems with healthcare.gov prior to the website’s disastrous October 1 launch.

The White House and HHS have yet to release the dated list of one-on-one meetings each claims occurred between Obama and Sebelius."

Insurance Commissioner Fired Day After Criticizing Obamacare 'Fix',"Washington, D.C.’s insurance commissioner was fired a day after he criticized President Barack Obama’s “administrative fix” for Obamacare.

William P. White, the D.C. insurance commissioner, told the Washington Post that D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray’s top deputies said Gray “wants to go in a different direction” after White was one of the first commissioners to push back against Obama’s “fix.”

Though White said he was not told that he was specifically fired for his criticism, he “said the timing was hard to ignore.” He said that 24 hours after his criticism, he was ‘basically being told, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.'”

Obama, in a Thursday White House press conference, announced an administrative fix that would allow insurance companies to extend plans that they have cancelled for another year. After that press conference, White, according to the Post, said Obama’s “action today undercuts the purpose of the exchanges, including the District’s DC Health Link, by creating exceptions that make it more difficult for them to operate.”

He also said that he concurred with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’s assessment that Obama’s administrative fix “threatens to undermine the new market, and may lead to higher premiums and market disruptions in 2014 and beyond.”

According to the Post, “White’s statement was removed from the department’s Web site sometime before Friday morning.”

White was “Gray’s commissioner for the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking since February 2011.” D.C. officials said he was removed because any criticism of Obama’s administrative fix needed to be vetted more thoroughly, and White failed acknowledge the misstep of not sending his statement criticizing Obama higher up the chain of command before releasing it.

After Obama falsely promised Americans that they could keep their insurance plans under Obamacare, he has scrambled after millions received cancellation notices, and he eventually announced on Thursday his administration will allow insurance companies to let those whose insurance plans were cancelled to re-apply and keep their plans for another year.

Whether insurance companies will be allowed to do so, though, will ultimately rest with the insurance commissioners of the states. And others, like Washington state’s insurance commissioner, have already rejected Obama’s “administrative fix,” vowing to “stay the course” with Obamacare.

As the Post noted, Obama’s plan “rattled the insurance industry, which had set prices for next year based on many of its products changing to comply with the health-care law,” because “allowing some plans to continue beyond Jan. 1 could also run afoul of provisions in laws passed by dozens of states and the District to implement” Obamacare."

How many of them apologize or correct the record for the misinformation and lies? How often do they research and correct the political points they were forced to air from politicians and political operatives?

Currently the mainstream media are scolding the Obama administration for lack of access and for using other types of media (social media and local media) to get their information out directly. They insinuate the behavior is tantamount to state run media.

Maybe if the mainstream media behaved as Jon Stewart in the video below, the administration would be less reticent. It is refreshing to watch Stewart who realizes that inasmuch as he is a satirist, he should apologize and correct the record when he wrongly maligns someone.

Last week he did a skit on Mississippi taking 148 years to ratify the 13th amendment, the amendment that abolished slavery. He implied that the former Mississippi secretary of state Dick Molpus, who presided over a 1995 attempt to ratify the 13th amendment, may have been a casual bigot. It turned out

Dick Molpus had a long and distinguished record for speaking out for Civil Rights.

He led charge on voting rights reform.

In 1989 he spoke at the 25th year anniversary of the three kids killed in Mississippi during the Civil Right conflicts for which he received death threats.

What is telling is no one called the Jon Stewart show to ask him to correct the record. He did it out of duty. One can only hope that in the long run the mainstream media will be forced to act accordingly. They have yet to apologize for all the misinformation that they have put out from the buildup to the war in Iraq to the misinformation about the Affordable Care Act. They could learn a bit from Stewart.

Mike Lee (R-Utah) declared on Monday that he and other congressional Republicans would be willing to shut down the federal government in order to block further implementation of President Barack Obama's health care reform law.

Speaking on Fox News, Lee said Republicans determined that refusing to fund Obamacare was the ""last stop"" before the individual mandate and the law's health insurance exchanges are set to go into effect at the beginning of next year.

“Congress of course has to pass a law to continue funding government -- lately we’ve been doing that through a funding mechanism called a continuing resolution,"" Lee said. ""If Republicans in both houses simply refuse to vote for any continuing resolution that contains further funding for further enforcement of Obamacare, we can stop it. We can stop the individual mandate from going into effect.”

Lee added that his effort, which he said was backed by ""13 or 14"" Senate Republicans and a host of House Republicans, wouldn't target popular Obamacare provisions that already had gone into effect, like a measure that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26.

Congress passed a continuing resolution in March, temporarily funding the government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Lee is suggesting that Republicans refuse to vote on a future measure to fund the government, setting up another standoff that would put critical government functions at risk.

The threat comes just days after House Republicans took their 38th vote to repeal part or all of Obamacare. Their latest move followed the Obama administration's announcement that it was delaying the law's employer mandate for a year, a decision that Republicans used to support their claims that Obamacare is unworkable.

Lee similarly suggested in a Friday interview on WBAL 1090 AM that he and other Republicans would be willing to shut down the government.

“I’ll utilize every procedural mechanism at my disposal to do it,” he said. “I generally don’t signal in advance what procedural maneuvers exactly I’ll use because it’s usually not good strategy. But what I am saying is I will not vote for a continuing resolution that contains funding for further Obamacare implantation and enforcement. So far I have got, I don’t know, 13 or 14 Senate Republicans who have joined me. I think a corresponding effort is starting to be kicked off in the House. And I expect these numbers to grow steadily as Americans realize the president has said he’s not going to implement the law as written. If he’s not going to implement the law, we shouldn’t be forced to fund it.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/12/16/is-president-obama-too-big-to-jail/,2013-12-16 00:00:00,[],Is President Obama 'too big to jail?',"A Chinese proverb says, “May you live in interesting times.” We certainly do. Historians will look back on this time as “the Obama criminal years.”

How lawless is the Obama administration? Many of the dirty deeds and scandals of Obama & Co. are public knowledge. Let’s start with the most astonishing.

Many citizens are aware that because of ObamaCare, millions of Americans are losing their health care coverage. Is this incompetence, or criminal fraud?

One thing is certain: it would be fraud if a private sector CEO knew that millions of customers would lose their insurance, yet repeated the same lie over and over -- “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it. Period.”

Why would we not hold a politician to the same standard?

That brings up the question “IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”

But this fraud isn’t just about money and power. It’s about cancer patients, our fellow citizens who may lose their lives as well as their health care coverage because of ObamaCare.

Even innocent children with cancer are among the victims of ObamaCare.

Yes, it turns out ObamaCare is one big death panel. With their policies being cancelled, these sick Americans are losing the very doctors, hospitals and treatments that have kept them alive.

What if some of them die from the stoppage of treatment? What if some die from stress and worry? What if some commit suicide from depression?

These are complicated questions. But isn’t the person whose lies and misrepresentations harmed them, at least partly responsible for their deaths?

So, IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?

This president has no shame. How many Americans know that a cancer patient merely discussing the disastrous ramifications of ObamaCare in public (thereby embarrassing Obama), is now being persecuted by the IRS?

Yes, it’s true. Bill Elliott is that terminally-ill cancer patient. He was audited by the IRS within days of an appearance on Fox News.

The IRS scandal is far more widespread than the American public knows. It is not just about Tea Party groups.

The IRS was used by Obama to go after any citizen daring to criticize him in the national media.

I’m one of those victims. These actions by a president are absolutely criminal. Richard Nixon’s articles of impeachment included the exact same charge of using the IRS to punish critics and silence free speech. But terminally ill cancer patients?

Obama has sunk to new lows. I'm a big boy. What he did to critics like me is disgusting and un-American. But what he did to a terminally ill cancer patient is disgraceful and unimaginable. This president is an out-of-control bully, pure and simple.

Will anyone show the courage to investigate and prosecute Obama?

“IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”

But wait (as late night infomercial pitchmen like to say), “There’s more.” When the citizens went to the ""state of the art"" ObamaCare web site for help, to try to save themselves, they found it defective.

It turns out the website was built so poorly, the personal information of consumers can be easily stolen. And it’s not just online scam artists we’re worried about. The “Obama navigators” themselves might do the stealing -- after all, it turns out many of them have criminal records.

Rather than hiring one of many highly-qualified American high tech Internet companies, why would Obama give a NO BID contract for hundreds of millions of dollars to a firm with less than stellar credentials?

Surely the reason couldn’t be that it’s the firm of one of Michelle Obama’s Princeton Black Alumni Association buddies?

Don’t you wonder how many of those millions of taxpayer dollars are committed to Democrat causes, or are now sitting in a Swiss bank account?

Can you imagine if this happened at a private sector company?

Can you imagine the outrage and criminal accusations coming from consumer protection advocates?

Can you imagine how quickly the federal government would shut down the business?

The criminal would have been “perp walked” out of his office in front of waiting journalists and photographers. He’d be facing a lifetime in prison.

So, “IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”

As bad as it is, ObamaCare is just another of the nonstop scandals of this administration. Any one of these scandals would have already forced a Republican president out of office. Obama owns all of them.

Benghazi. More absurd lies than ObamaCare, a possible arms deal with rebels gone bad, and the cover-up of murder.

Fast and Furious. Another government arms deal gone bad, responsibility for the murder of a U.S. border guard, another blatant cover-up.

The NSA scandal. Obama listens into all of our calls and communications. I hope he’s listening to mine. He’ll hear the word IMPEACHMENT come up in every sentence.

The AP scandal. Obama and paranoid buddies like Attorney General Eric Holder are even illegally spying on their adoring Kool-Aid drinking friends in the media.

The IRS scandal. It’s not just about targeting his political opposition. It’s about the much more serious scandal of using the IRS to change the outcome of the election. Obama’s goal was to neutralize the powerful Tea Parties to prevent a repeat of the 2010 GOP landslide.

Guess what? It worked.

Obama used the IRS to kill conservative momentum, intensity, and enthusiasm, silence criticism in the media, and starve conservative fundraising. These guys put the ""thug"" in Chicago.

The Census Bureau scandal. It appears government employees faked the unemployment numbers in the weeks leading up to the election to re-elect a president who wouldn’t know what a job looked like, if it hit him in the face.

How could one leader be involved in this many lies, frauds, scandals, and cover-ups? There’s enough here for a century of presidents!

Forget impeachment, it’s time for criminal prosecution. There’s enough here to put a CEO away for multiple life sentences. Bernie Madoff would blush at what Obama has pulled off (so far).

The question is, “IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?”"

We%27re elected to Congress to make tough decisions.

But instead of coming to the table to negotiate with us%2C Democrats have met our repeated requests to negotiate with inaction and opposition.

This debate is about fairness.

We have arrived at a government shutdown because the Senate has refused to make the tough decisions.

Despite our repeated attempts to negotiate, Majority Leader Harry Reid and his Democratic-controlled Senate are slamming the door on re-opening the government by refusing to talk. In fact, the only communication they've had with us in the past several weeks has been to say they won't negotiate.

They've refused to sit down and engage in a dialogue. They've refused to consider any reforms or changes to the status quo. And they've refused to stop members of Congress from receiving special treatment under Obamacare.

No matter where I go when I'm home in eastern Washington — the grocery store, the local coffee shop, the county fair — the concern is the same: Obamacare is making life harder for everyday Americans. At the doctor's office, the dinner table and in the job market. This is what this debate is really about: real people and real concerns.

But the Senate has chosen to ignore them. They've chosen to take the easy way out — yet again — and ignore the majority of Americans who want Obamacare tied to the debate over government funding. We're elected to Congress to make tough decisions. But instead of coming to the table to negotiate with us, Democrats have met our numerous requests to negotiate with inaction and opposition.

Sen. Reid said he would not negotiate ""with a gun to our head."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called us ""legislative arsonists."" And President Obama accused us of ""holding the U.S. hostage."" This isn't how leaders solve problems. This rhetoric is incendiary and unconstructive. While the Democrats continue to lambast House Republicans with these baseless accusations, we will continue to advance real solutions for the people who elected us.

That's why the House acted early — and first — to keep the government open. Just because the president and Senate disagree with our solution doesn't mean they should refuse to come the table to work out our differences. Now we ask the Senate to fulfill its most basic responsibility and work with us to find a solution.

We voted on Monday night to have the House and Senate negotiate — and to delay the individual mandate and repeal the Obamacare subsidy for members of Congress — because if the American people have to bear the burden of Obamacare, so too should their representatives in Congress. We cannot solve the problems before us if the Senate refuses to talk.

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., serves as chair of the House Republican Conference.

The three-year anniversary of the signing of the bloated government grab is tomorrow, and what better time to point out its massive failures and punitive complications than after it is too late to do anything about it?

In the media’s defense, some of the failures being reported on now weren’t apparent in 2009 and 2010, but that’s not my complaint. My complaint — and what should be America’s complaint — is where was this kind of scrutiny and reporting when this terrible bill was being gamed through the all-Democrat federal government?

As we all know, skeptical, forward-looking media analysis of ObamaCare was pretty much non-existent back then. We also know that those who did read the bill and report on its real and potential horrors (through New Media and in Townhall meetings) were demonized by the media.

Rather than report on the devilish details or laugh Democrats out of office for submitting fraudulent ObamaCare budgets to the CBO so the monstrosity could be called “deficit neutral,” the media instead played State Pipe Organ and focused on all the “goodies.”

In the meantime, out here in the real world and contrary to all those cotton candy promises the media assured us would come true, insurers facing all kinds of restrictions and a glut of sick people have boosted our health care premiums, and companies everywhere are cutting back employee work hours to avoid being forced to provide insurance. Moreover, contrary to Obama’s biggest promise, people are losing their insurance because companies would prefer to pay the fine than for the Cadillac plans ObamaCare demands.

And how can one even begin to count the number of individual ObamaCare horror stories that dribble out almost daily, not from the ObamaMedia, naturally — but from conservative media sites like Drudge? We’re about to face a terrifying shortage of physicians and heaven only knows what this means.

But if you believe in the philosophy of better-late-than-never, Politico actually summoned a little moral courage Friday morning. One of its morning leads takes a fairly in-depth look at how the bill remains unpopular and the massive uphill battle the government faces (money and tech) to get the ObamaCare pieces in place by October, when people are supposed to start signing up. (ObamaCare’s insurance exchanges and most punishing mandates hit early next year.)

Here’s Wednesday’s Wonk Blog at the Washington Post:

Last week I posted a copy of the draft application for Obamacare benefits, which clocks in at a hefty 21 pages.

Consumer advocates and Wonkblog commenters had similar questions: Why on earth would the federal government create such a complex form to obtain a public benefit?

You don’t have to spend much time with the chart to get that, it’s really not simple at all.

And Wednesday’s New York Times:

‘Our revenues are about $8 million, but the food business is a low-margin industry so cutting $108,000 out of our profits, which are just over $200,000, is a big deal,’ said Ms. Shein, who is the chief executive. They are evaluating different ways to comply with the new law and finance the expense.

You get my point. But if you don’t, Sean Hannity has a terrific round-up here.

Over at Investors Business Daily, they’ve come up with “10 Disturbing Facts Americans Have Learned” about ObamaCare over the last three years.

A better title might have been “10 Disturbing Facts About ObamaCare the Media Are Still Covering Up.”

Regardless, “disturbing” is a kind word when you’re talking about skyrocketing premium costs, losing your employer-based insurance, having your hours cut back, and nearly a trillion in new tax hikes that will hit the middle class.

The damage Obama, Democrats, the media, and the Supreme Court have done to this country is impossible to wrap your mind around. How did so many become so corrupted that they gleefully aided and abetted the likely destruction of our most vital and successful institution: the imperfect but still amazing American health care system?

And God help us; it is just getting started.

Washington (CNN) - Two Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have asked the panel’s chairman to withdraw his Obamacare subpoena of the White House chief technology officer, according to a letter sent Monday.

In the letter released to reporters, Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Gerald Connolly of Virginia called Rep. Darrell Issa’s subpoena of Todd Park “unnecessary and misguided,” and said it was part of a “predetermined political strategy rather than a constructive effort to conduct responsible oversight.”



The California Republican subpoenaed Park on Friday, saying he had refused to testify at a hearing scheduled for Wednesday on the rocky rollout of the HealthCare.gov website.

“Your unwillingness to appear before the committee continues an unfortunate pattern of the current administration when it comes to matters of transparency and congressional oversight,” Issa wrote in a letter to Park.

Connolly and Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight panel, argued that Issa mischaracterized a proposed delay by Park in testifying as a refusal to do so.

“When Mr. Park received your invitation to testify, his immediate response, as conveyed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, was to agree to testify before the Committee, but to request a short delay while the lion’s share of fixes to Healthcare.gov are being implemented in November,” Cummings and Connolly wrote, noting that Park also offered to give a briefing to Congress.

“He did not request a delay of months, but of weeks.”

The delay is necessary, the two Democrats argued, because preparing for a congressional hearing would take away from time needed to fix the beleaguered website.

“Mr. Park has been a key leader in around-the-clock efforts to improve the functionality of the HealthCare.gov website, and diverting Mr. Park’s energies at this moment could seriously impair those efforts.”

Democrats have criticized Issa and other Republicans for their sustained assault on HealthCare.gov and the law that created it in heated congressional hearings over the past few weeks.

Democrats argue the hearings and Issa’s multiple subpoenas of Obama administration officials, are politically motivated.

Issa has said he’s interested only in the truth.

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/03/Obama-Loses-Two-HHS-Mandate-Cases-in-One-Week,2013-02-03 00:00:00,['Ken Klukowski'],Obama Loses Two HHS Mandate Cases in One Week,"Obamacare’s HHS Mandate lost yet again in a federal appeals court last Thursday, and then lost in a second case on Friday. These cases continue on the long road to the Supreme Court, and President Obama’s new “accommodation” of religious employers will do nothing to stop them.

There are now at least 12 HHS Mandate cases in the federal courts of appeals, all challenging Kathleen Sebelius’ deeply-unpopular Obamacare regulation that all employers with 50 or more employees must offer healthcare plans that cover birth control, sterilization, and abortion-related services.

Grote Industries is an Indiana-based company that makes lighting systems for cars. It’s owned and managed by a family of Roman Catholics who object to birth control. On Jan. 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an injunction pending appeal in Grote Industries v. Sebelius by a 2-1 vote, holding among other things that there is enough of a chance that the HHS Mandate violates federal religious liberty protections that the Chicago-based appeals court is ordering that this company does not need to comply with the regulation.

The lead lawyer on the case, Matt Bowman from the Alliance Defending Freedom, said:

Americans have the God-given freedom to live and do business according to their faith. Forcing employers to surrender their faith in order to earn a living is unprecedented, unnecessary, and unconstitutional. Honoring God is important every day, in all areas of life, including in our work. Freedom is not the government’s to give and take away when it pleases.

Then on Feb. 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit also issued an injunction pending appeal in Annex Medical, Inc. v. Sebelius. Annex Medical has less than 50 employees, so it’s not required by the Obamacare law to provide healthcare. Nonetheless, the owner offers healthcare to all his employees.

But the owner of this Minnesota-based company, Stuart Lind, is again a deeply-religious man who objects to the HHS Mandate. So the federal appeals court in St. Louis likewise held that it’s likely the HHS Mandate violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (and possibly the Constitution as well).

So a dozen such cases are now before different appellate courts, in different stages of appeal. (This doesn’t count dozens more cases that are before the trial-level federal district courts.) Decisions on whether to issue what are called preliminary injunctions in these cases–which will be the next step in the legal process–are likely to start coming down in late spring, meaning that sometime this fall the Supreme Court could vote to take one or more of these cases, and decide the legality of Sebelius’ abortion-related mandate in 2014 once and for all.

The Obama administration new supposed accommodation for religious employers doesn’t change this equation. Legal experts are still trying to determine if it isn’t just a series of accounting gimmicks. But even if it allowed religious employers to completely opt out of the HHS Mandate, it nonetheless only applies to nonprofit employers. The companies that secured early wins in their cases last week are for-profit, secular businesses. So their cases will continue, and within a year one of the many cases currently on appeal should be before our nation’s highest court.

The point is to get off the sinking ship. When Nov. 30 comes and goes with, at the very least, according to the administration, 20 percent of people unable to access HealthCare.gov, that would seem to be the smart move. If they hang tight, Democrats face challenges from their left in blue enclaves and from the right in purple or red ones. Moreover, they will need to discredit the president and this particular effort if they are to keep alive that liberal cult of big government. It’s not all big government that is unworkable, just this mess made by Obama."
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/25/obamacare-fallout-turns-into-party-feud-for-democrats/,2013-12-25 00:00:00,['Joseph Weber'],ObamaCare botch fuels Dem feud in Maryland,"The botched ObamaCare rollout that has given Republicans a hammer going into the 2014 election cycle is now splitting Democrats in deep-blue Maryland, as the problems become political fodder for next year's gubernatorial race.

Despite Maryland Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley being among the first to embrace the Affordable Care Act and create an online exchange, the state-run site has had a disastrous start, like the federal exchange. This has left gubernatorial frontrunner and Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who helped lead the local ObamaCare launch, taking hits from fellow Democrats.

“It’s almost like a Saturday Night Live skit,” primary challenger and Attorney General Doug Gansler told reporters last week. “It’s comical that it’s not working. … It’s tragic for folks who don’t have access to health care.”

While the health care overhaul's launch has caused consternation for Democrats across the country, Maryland is the rare battlefield where the issue is creeping into a major party primary.

Gansler -- whose campaign had its own rocky start – trails Brown by double digits, according to the most recent poll, and has tried to pin the website problems on the lieutenant governor, Maryland’s second in command.

“Brown and others were so boastful about Maryland leading the country [but] here we are behind such states as Nevada and Kentucky, let alone California and states like that,” Gansler recently told Politico.

Fewer than 4,000 Marylanders enrolled in the first two months, well short of the goal of 25,500. Just 7,435 have signed up through the first three weeks of December, though O’Malley says the site problems essentially have been fixed.

Brown, as co-chairman of the Maryland Health Care Reform Coordinating Council, was the two-term governor’s point man on improving health care across the state.

And though Brown was not directly involved in building the site, Gansler has nevertheless blamed him for failed leadership and for being part of an administration that outsourced website work to North Dakota while Maryland has “literally the smartest people in the country.”

Meanwhile, Maryland Democratic Rep. John Delaney is suggesting Maryland scrap the site and send residents to the federal exchange.

Still, no matter how nasty the primary gets, the party certainly is favored to win the November election, considering only two Republicans have taken the governorship since the late 1960s. The Democratic primary is next June.

Though Gansler continues to hammers away at Brown and the rollout debacle, he faces criticism about using the situation to right his struggling campaign, in which he calls himself “an early and ardent supporter of President Obama’s health care reform law.”

His campaign problems began in August when an audiotape surfaced in which Gansler suggests Brown, who is black, was relying more on his race than his successes.

The incident was followed by revelations in October that Gansler forced his State Police detail to break traffic laws to get him to appointments and that he stopped by a summer beach bash attended by his son and fellow graduating seniors where underage drinking seemingly was taking place.

Gansler has never denied the allegations but has accused the Brown campaign of dirty tricks.

“[Gansler] made some stupid mistakes but he’s a good candidate,” Democratic strategist David Heller, president of Main Street Communications, told FoxNew.com on Tuesday. “He’s very smart and a great fundraiser. But Brown has the blessing of O’Malley and half of the state’s congressional delegation. It’s not a fair fight.”

To be sure, O’Malley has groomed Brown for years, giving him a lead role in health care reform and the successful effort this year to tighten statewide gun laws.

Brown indeed has endorsements from both Maryland senators, Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin, as well as from House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer and Reps. Elijah Cummings, Donna Edwards and John Sarbanes, all Democrats.

The most recent major poll, by Maryland-based Gonzales Research & Marketing Strategies Inc., was conducted in the first 13 days of October and had Gansler trailing by 20 points.

Gansler spokesman Bob Weelock told FoxNews.com on Tuesday he “couldn’t and wouldn’t” speculate on how the extended ObamaCare fallout and Gansler’s campaign tactics might impact voters."

(CNN) - Sarah Palin said the Internal Revenue Service's recent scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status is a sign of ""corruption at the heart of big government"" in Washington.

""So many Americans knew this was happening, but many felt defenseless and even helpless against a government that seems to roll along without accountability or sense of obligation to the people it's supposed to serve. These Americans were mocked for being concerned about this, but now we see light shining on the truth, finally,"" she wrote in an online posting shortly after the IRS acknowledged it made ""mistakes"" in handling the applications of tea party groups.

Lois Lerner, director of tax exempt organizations for the IRS, said 75 applications were singled out between 2010 and 2012 for extended review because the words ""tea party"" and ""patriot"" were included in the groups' names. Those applications were part of approximately 300 which received additional scrutiny during that time.

""Americans should remember that this same corrupt IRS will be in charge of enforcing Obamacare,"" she wrote. ""And this same inept and corrupt government will supposedly secure our now unsecured borders in advance of immigration reform and will implement a completely ethical and non-political IPAB panel to make life and death health care decisions for you and your family. Forgive me for not trusting these big government promises any more than I trust the White House's latest Benghazi spin or the IRS' fairness.""

Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, further wrote, ""I'm sure President Obama is grateful for all the help the IRS gave his reelection campaign, but, still, you have to wonder how the bureaucrats who tried to pull this off can sleep at night.""

She called for ""accountability and a full investigation"" as well as a special committee to look into the Benghazi, Libya, attack last September.

http://news.yahoo.com/unity-democrats-push-back-obama-175506793--politics.html,,[],"After unity, some Democrats push back on Obama","WASHINGTON (AP) — Just two weeks after President Barack Obama saw his Democratic Party put up an unyielding front against Republicans, his coalition is showing signs of stress.

From health care to spying to pending budget deals, many congressional Democrats are challenging the administration and pushing for measures that the White House has not embraced.

Some Democrats are seeking to extend the enrollment period for new health care exchanges. Others want to place restraints on National Security Administration surveillance capabilities. Still others are standing tough against any budget deal that uses long-term reductions in major benefit programs to offset immediate cuts in defense.

Though focused on disparate issues, the Democrats' anxieties are connected by timing and stand out all the more when contrasted with the remarkable unity the party displayed during the recent showdown over the partial government shutdown and the confrontation over raising the nation's borrowing limit.

""That moment was always going to be fleeting,"" said Matt Bennett, who worked in the Clinton White House and who regularly consults with Obama aides. ""The White House, every White House, understands that these folks, driven either by principle or the demands of the politics of their state, have to put daylight between themselves and the president on occasion.""

Obama and the Democrats emerged from the debt and shutdown clash with what they wanted: a reopened government, a higher debt ceiling and a Republican Party reeling in the depths of public opinion polls.

But within days, attention turned to the problem-riddled launch of the 3-year-old health care law's enrollment stage and revelations that the U.S. had been secretly monitoring the communications of as many as 35 allied leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And with new budget talks underway, Democratic Party liberals reiterated demands that Obama not agree to changes that reduce Social Security or Medicare benefits even in the improbable event Republicans agree to increase budget revenues.

Story continues

The fraying on the Democratic Party edges is hardly unraveling Obama's support and it pales when compared to the upheaval within the Republican Party as it distances itself from the tactics of tea party conservatives. But the pushback from Democrats comes as Obama is trying to draw renewed attention to his agenda, including passage of an immigration overhaul, his jobs initiatives and the benefits of his health care law.

The computer troubles that befell the start of health insurance sign-ups have caused the greatest anxiety. Republicans pounced on the difficulties as evidence of deeper flaws in the law. But Democrats, even as they defended the policy, also demanded answers in the face of questions from their constituents.

""The fact is that the administration really failed these Americans,"" Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Pa., told Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner at a hearing this week. ""So going forward, there can be just no more excuses.""

In the Senate, 10 Democrats signed on to a letter seeking an unspecified extension of the enrollment period, which ends March 31. ""As you continue to fix problems with the website and the enrollment process, it is critical that the administration be open to modifications that provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., wrote.

Another Democratic senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has called for a one-year delay in the requirement that virtually all Americans have health insurance or pay a fine.

On Thursday, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, Tavenner and the White House's designated troubleshooter for the health care website, Jeffrey Zients, met privately with Senate Democrats.

Officials said some of the lawmakers spoke critically of the website's widely publicized problems and sought reassurances they would soon be fixed.

In response, Zients said there already have been some improvements and individuals are now able to sign up in larger numbers than was the case a month ago. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to discuss events at a private meeting.

And in an interview on CNN, Vice President Joe Biden apologized for the problems. ""There's no excuse,"" he said, ""We just have to fix it.""

Democrats who have talked to White House officials in recent days describe them as rattled by the health care blunders. But they say they are confident that the troubled website used for enrollment will be corrected and fully operational by the end of November.

The spying revelations also have created some tensions between the administration and Democrats. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and until now a staunch supporter of the NSA's surveillance, called for a ""total review of all intelligence programs"" following the Merkel reports.

She said that when it came to the NSA collecting intelligence on the leaders of allies such as France, Spain, Mexico and Germany, ""Let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed.""

In the House, Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, complained that the intelligence committees had been kept out of the loop about the collection of data on foreign leaders.

""Why did we not know that heads of state were being eavesdropped on, spied on?"" she asked Obama administration intelligence officials on Tuesday. ""We are the Intelligence Committee. And we did not -- we didn't know that. And now all of us, all of us, are dealing with a problem in our international relations. There will be changes.""

With Congress renewing budget talks Wednesday, liberals have been outspoken in their insistence that Democrats vigorously resist efforts to reduce long-term deficits with savings in Social Security or Medicare. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who usually votes with Democrats, has been the most outspoken, saying he fears a budget deal will contain a proposal in Obama's budget to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs.

Obama, however, has proposed that remedy only if Republicans agree to raise tax revenue, a bargain that GOP lawmakers involved in the discussions made clear they would reject. Moreover, leaders from both parties as well as White House officials have signaled that in budget talks, they are looking for a small budget deal, not the type of ""grand bargain"" that would embrace such a revenue-for-benefit-cuts deal.

Still, many liberals warn that such cuts aren't palatable even if coupled with additional revenues.

""The idea, the notion that we're going to solve this problem or it's going to be OK if we were able to raise revenue and cut this thing back at the same time, it just isn't going to fly outside of Washington,"" said Jim Dean, chairman of the liberal advocacy group Democracy for America.

Marijuana businesses are drawing the eye of investors, who see it as a growth industry. Ted S. Warren / AP file

It looks like any other business conference — lots of suits, name badges, a long line to the buffet — except that the 700 people who each paid $599 to be in this conference hall south of Seattle are in an industry unlike any other: marijuana.

The people at this meeting aren’t Cheech and Chong. They’ve come bearing business degrees and investor money, looking for the next great thing.

""This conference is 100 percent focused on business,"" said Chris Walsh, editor of the Medical Marijuana Business Daily. His publication is sponsoring the National Marijuana Business Conference. Now in its second year, attendance has doubled, and more than 30 exhibitors paid as much as $16,000 to talk about investments, equipment, legal services and accounting.

""There's a lot of other types of shows out there that are for the typical stoners,"" Walsh said. ""This is all business and financial.""

The pot business is, well, growing. A Gallup poll shows that U.S. support for legalizing cannabis has reached 58 percent. Election night saw pro-marijuana laws passing in places such as Portland, Maine, and Lansing, Mich.

""It's an incredibly exciting time to be in the cannabis industry,"" said Tripp Keber, an investor and the managing director of Dixie Elixirs & Edibles, which sells products laced with THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient in pot) to medical marijuana dispensaries.

Business has tripled in 2013, according to Keber.

""Three years ago, nobody was interested in investing, but just yesterday I met with a hedge fund. I met with institutional investors,"" he said.

Investment action is ramping up as the two states that have legalized recreational ""adult use"" pot — Washington and Colorado — begin to issue licenses and the first retail outlets prepare to open. The federal government said in August that the Justice Department would not stop states from creating their own regulatory and taxation frameworks.

That federal decision to step back in turn unleashed ""pent-up demand"" from investors, said Troy Dayton, co-founder and CEO of the ArcView Group, which conducts market research on the pot industry. It recently released a report predicting that the legal marijuana business will increase 64 percent this year and top $10 billion within five years.

""This is the next great American industry,"" Dayton said.

Banking and taxes

But there are a few weeds in the weed patch. One is banking. Though the federal government is looking the other way, banks remain reluctant to offer a place for growers and sellers to safely store their cash.

At the same time, new private equity and venture capital investors are coming out of the woodwork. Many want to invest in products and services not directly related to pot itself, such as security systems and software programs.

""Mark Twain had a great quote,"" said Dayton. ""He said that when there is a gold rush on, it's a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.""



The larger dilemma, however, may be the taxes on recreational pot. How high is too high? Colorado voters passed a 25 percent tax on it, more than three times the state tax on medical pot. Washington has mandated a tax of at least 50 percent, versus no tax on medical marijuana.

""I don't think it has gone very well,"" said Shy Sadis on the rollout of Washington's new law.

Sadis, a longtime owner of several medical pot dispensaries in Seattle, is applying for retail licenses to sell recreational cannabis. State officials want to close all untaxed, unregulated medical outlets and move everyone into the taxed, regulated recreational side — even though there will be far fewer outlets and the product will cost a lot more.

""A lot of patients come in here and are upset that medical is going to be gone, and they're thinking, 'Wow, maybe my vote should have went the other way,'"" Sadis said.



Keber is confident that buyers will eventually migrate to a taxed, regulated, tested, legitimate system. ""The alcohol industry has had 80 years to get the process right,"" he said.

Whether it takes 80 years or 80 days, few believe the momentum toward legalization will go up in smoke.

""No one knows how this is going to play out,"" said editor Walsh. ""We're going to find out in a couple months.""

Samuels: To marijuana abusers everywhere: Are you really that weak that you need pot?

At first glance, my 11-year-old son seems like your everyday, all-American kid. He loves baseball and basketball, plays Xbox with his friends when they come over, and posts innocuous pictures of the family dog on his Instagram feed. Given these mundane facts about the boy, you can imagine my surprise when, while watching the news (again, seemingly from out of nowhere) he asked me, ""If pot is so bad, why are they trying to legalize it?""

And, just like that, the long and involved talk my wife and I had given our children about drugs was tossed out the window.

We had explained the harmful effects of marijuana. Like cigarettes, smoking marijuana introduces tar, carbon monoxide and cancer-causing agents into your body.

Neither my wife nor I anticipated that our son would be stopped on the street by unscrupulous potheads petitioning outside of the local grocery store and being fed a line of rhetoric that went against what we were trying to teach him.

It turns out that potheads weren't exactly the problem; they were the symptom. Let me tell you why.

Howard C. Samuels

If you have a fever and you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have pneumonia, do you ask him to treat the fever, or do you ask him to treat the pneumonia? Most of us would ask him to treat the pneumonia because the pneumonia is the problem; the fever is the symptom.

It's the same way with the argument about the legalization of marijuana. I'm not interested in focusing on the symptom; I want to eradicate the problem. And the problem is that we're even considering legalizing marijuana at all.

Let's take a look at the medical marijuana issue in Los Angeles (where I live) and we can see where legalization takes us. It has been my experience that anyone can get a medical marijuana card in L.A.; all you need is $25-$100 and the ability to lie about needing it. You just make an appointment with some company, walk in and state your problem(s) and why you need a card (with no proof of medical conditions whatsoever) and you will be prescribed a card that is good for one year. It's a toothless system that isn't well-regulated.

Why are some of the people who petition for legalizing marijuana so passionate about it? Because when you smoke pot, you get loaded. You fry your brain. That's why the patients I see in my treatment center call it ""getting baked."" Pot is all about getting really high.

Now, I have nothing against people who smoke pot. In fact, I believe it is a crime to put someone in prison for smoking pot. Honestly, do we really need some idiot frat boy to get picked up during Mardi Gras for smoking pot and find himself locked in a cage with a monster for six months? Kevin Sabet, a former senior adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy poses a terrific point when he says that criminal processing for possession of marijuana needs improvement, but legalization is a step too far.

Marijuana supporters like to argue that marijuana is similar to alcohol. While alcohol is legal, it also accounts for tens of thousands of deaths every year in car accidents or other drinking-related misfortunes. But we can't turn the clock back on that one because it's too embedded in our society.

Supporters of marijuana say that marijuana should be legalized because old people and women and children who have ailments like glaucoma or cancer or intractable seizures need it.

It is painful to watch people suffer. I am not against helping people. In a perfect world, a woman suffering from cancer should be able to get a prescription from her doctor, go to a pharmacy, acquire her medical marijuana, go home and recuperate from her last round of chemotherapy. But we don't live in a perfect world, and you don't need a Ph.D. to see that the spirit of that argument is being exploited by people who aren't using the marijuana for medical reasons at all; they are using it to get high.

Introducing legalized marijuana into our culture would be like using gasoline to put out a fire, because it stunts growth.

Do you know why we don't see potheads out in public? It's because they're sitting at home smoking weed and staring at their television sets or playing video games all day. Do you have any idea how many marijuana addicts I encounter at my rehab on a daily basis? They talk about wanting to be productive. But what pot does is it kills their motivation -- it destroys people's ability to go out and work and to have a career. It makes them want to do nothing but lie around all day. Is that what you want for your children? Is that what you want for your loved ones?

And how do you market marijuana? We have only just now moved into an era where cigarette smoking is commonly known to be harmful, but now advertisers have a new product to sell. Who do you think they're going to market their product to? Not you or me, because we're not stupid enough to believe the lie; we know too much. They're going to follow in the footsteps of the cigarette companies in the 1980s and market this stuff to young people.

The very idea of that sickens me. I know what marijuana does to the human mind because I started smoking weed when I was 15 years old. It literally robbed me of my motivation to participate in my own life. I was absolutely OK with sitting around all day eating cookies and watching television and getting high with my friends. But, to go out and earn a living and do something with my life? That was all stuff that I was going to do later after I came down off of the marijuana. But, then I'd smoke some more and think, ""Why bother?"" . . . and, eventually, I started shooting heroin. If my family had not intervened and sought professional help, I would probably still be wandering aimlessly through the streets today; searching for that elusive ""perfect high.""

Even if you only stay with marijuana in your repertoire of illicit drugs to abuse, it will never yield positive results. Ever.

And, I posit this to marijuana abusers everywhere: Are you really that weak? Are you really that uncomfortable in your own skin that you can't handle living your life or having real experiences without being high? Is it really impossible for you to live life without a drug? Because, if it is, it breaks my heart and I feel sorry for you. Because that's no way to live.

And my kid, he's going to know the truth about you. He's going to know that every time you approach him arguing for the legalization of marijuana, what you're really doing is asking him to vote to make it OK for you to spend the rest of your life half-baked on your sofa, too stoned to go out and play with your own kids or do the things you've always dreamed of doing. To my kid, I'm going to say that this means one less competitor on his road to a successful and fulfilling life.

And, to the potheads who are so passionate about being allowed to smoke their lives away, I have only one thing to say: Dream On.

One of the first promises he made as the newly elected president was that he was “not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws.” This was even reiterated formally in the so-called Ogden memo of 2009, in which the Department of Justice instructed U.S. attorneys that federal enforcement should apply only to medical marijuana operations that were not in clear compliance with state law.

Obama has since “clarified” those promises, but it still makes no sense that Matthew R. Davies, a business school graduate who set out in 2009 to create a medical marijuana dispensary that would be in full compliance with California law, is facing up to 15 years in prison — with a mandatory five-year sentence.

This is just one more puzzling incident in the history of a president who not only made these promises but has also admitted to heavy recreational use of marijuana himself in his youth. As a second-term president, with little to lose, why is he continuing his odd campaign on a state-approved industry that employs people, pays taxes and distributes a safe and clinically useful product?

SERIES: Behind the marijuana industry

Lost in this fray is the fact that marijuana is medicine. My son is autistic and has an autoimmune gastrointestinal problem for which, at my suggestion, his doctor prescribed him Marinol (a synthetic THC drug). When that proved ineffective, the doctor agreed to prescribe medical cannabis, which is legal in Rhode Island where we were living and, unlike in some states, such as California, is approved for pediatric use. At the time, our son was eating his clothes. Whether as an autistic behavior or because of gastric pain, we weren’t sure; but every day, unless we had him shirtless, he would consume the entire front of his cotton shirt, and sometimes his jacket, on the bus to and from school.

Medical marijuana cured him. But it wasn’t as easy as running out and buying him a joint. When we first considered cannabis, my husband and I made a decision not to procure it illegally. That was complicated because although medical marijuana was legal in Rhode Island at the time, dispensaries were not, and we needed information about what kind of marijuana might help our son.

There are hundreds of strains of cannabis, with varying clinical properties — anxiety relief, sleep promotion, analgesia, anti-nausea — and the ways they are processed also affect the way they work. I realize that some people use dispensaries to purchase cannabis for recreational use, but I can attest that the cannabis experts at the out-of-state dispensaries we consulted were focused on the medical properties of the marijuana they sold. They shared their considerable knowledge to help us find the particular strain that cured our son’s pica (the medical name for eating nonfood items). I keep a corduroy jacket with a half-nibbled sleeve as a reminder of that day.

Our doctor, who started out as a healthy skeptic, was so impressed and moved by our son’s experience that he asked if I’d speak with another parent in a similar situation. This woman was desperate for help. Her son was even more destructive and aggressive than ours, and she had several children (we have one) and just didn’t have the time and energy for the kind of trial-and-error experimentation we had done. If she’d had access to a good dispensary, things could have been different for her.

Without access, a medical marijuana license is a piece of paper. Even with the attentive grower we found in Rhode Island, we ran into problems, including a pest infestation and a robbery. Then came an even more devastating obstacle: After a year or so, he informed us he was giving up growing because he needed to find work. If there had been a dispensary in Rhode Island, he could have sold his excess there. But because he wanted to follow the law — which meant patients could only pay his actual costs — he was in an economic bind.

For a medical marijuana patient, a well-run, reliable dispensary like Matthew Davies’ should be a basic patient right. There is scientific consensus that cannabis has useful clinical benefits, and unlike synthetic pharmaceuticals, it has almost no toxicity.

An article in the Atlantic estimates that prosecuting Davies’ dispensary is going to run more than a million dollars, not to mention putting a man with two small children and no criminal record in prison for five to 15 years. The federal government has charged Davies with cultivating marijuana. It contends he “sought to make large profits,” which, if true, might have put him out of compliance with California law. He has insisted he violated no state laws. Putting that issue aside, it is clear that he was operating transparently and attempting to stay within the law. Is he really the biggest threat federal law enforcers can find to prosecute?

When large banks illegally game the system and ruin people’s lives with subprime mortgages, instead of prosecution, our government bails them out and allows the CEOs huge bonuses. And yet a person who creates a business that provides safe, reliable medicine that patients rely on may have his life upended for following state law. According to press accounts, Davies’ business is transparent, efficient and provides professional service — all things worthy of praise. It has the additional social benefits of both employing people and helping law enforcement by keeping illicit marijuana off the streets. If a well-run, meticulously inventoried, state-law-compliant place is a target for federal action, no dispensary is safe.

According to Marijuana Policy Project estimates, there are more than 1 million medical marijuana patients in the U.S. An attack on state-approved dispensaries is an attack on patients. We would consider it inhumane to take away anti-nausea or pain medicine from a cancer patient. But when the administration raids dispensaries and destroys plants, that is exactly what it ias doing.

So what is the lesson here? Smoke marijuana illegally, and you can become president. Try to provide a safe, consistent product that keeps the trade out of domestic and foreign drug cartels and brings in tax revenue, and face 15 years jail time.

Instead, the high-powered opiate combined with other prescription drugs left him feeling worse. The 50-year-old from Manteno had heard marijuana could provide relief, but he was hesitant to seek it out given the long line of police officers in his family. He eventually gave pot a try, saying he desperately wanted to spend more time with his children.

""In a matter of days, I started to feel better. I could keep food down,"" Graham said. ""I thought, 'Oh, boy, what am I going to say at Thanksgiving?' But then they noticed that I could eat, so they knew something was up. ... I hadn't been there the three previous years because I wasn't able to get out of bed.""

Graham was one of dozens of supporters on hand Thursday at the University of Chicago Center for Care and Discovery as Gov. Pat Quinn signed the state's medical marijuana bill into law, with Illinois joining 19 other states and the District of Columbia that have legalized cannabis for patient use.

The decision by Illinois leaders to take the plunge on medical marijuana after decades of resistance will unfold amid concerns that stretch from law enforcement officials who fear unused pot will be sold illegally to anti-drug educators who worry about the mixed message the law sends to kids to suburban zoning boards who'd rather pot shops not pop up on Main Street.

There will be plenty of time for such issues to be aired.

The law, which sets up a four-year trial program, doesn't take effect until Jan. 1. After that, state regulators will spend months coming up with rules spelling out who gets to open the 22 marijuana growing operations across Illinois, which businesses get the 60 licenses to sell the finished product and how patients will get medical marijuana cards from doctors. Then a panel of state lawmakers will decide whether the regulations are drawn tightly enough.

By the time that plays out, crops are grown and the pot stores open, it could be fall 2014 before those afflicted with one of 40 or so medical conditions can legally toke up to ease their pain.

But the long lead time is not stopping the legalized marijuana industry from descending on Chicago in three weeks for a ""cannabusiness symposium.""

There'll be how-to panels, tips on dealing with the government and, of course, networking opportunities — more big business than the peace-and-love image the less-successful push to legalize recreational use of marijuana calls to mind.

When those with a medical marijuana card are legally able to get the product, they'll be allowed up to 2.5 ounces every two weeks. That's about enough to fill two small plastic sandwich bags. They'll also be able to buy it baked into brownies, muffins, croutons and trail bars. And they can expect to pay taxes on their pot purchases. In Colorado, patients pay $80 and above for an ounce of medical marijuana, choosing from varieties with names like ""Jack Flash,"" ""Sour Diesel"" and ""LA Kush.""

Illinois restrictions

But unlike Colorado, which has come under fire for lax marijuana regulations even as the state gets ready to legalize recreational pot use next year, drafters of Illinois' law say it will be among the toughest in the nation.

Patients here can't grow their own pot and must have an existing relationship with a prescribing doctor. To qualify, patients must be diagnosed with a serious to chronic illness laid out in the law, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma or HIV. It's likely that patients would have to pay out of pocket for marijuana, as it is not typically covered by insurance companies.

The Illinois Department of Public Health will be in charge of issuing medical marijuana cards to patients and their caregivers, who could purchase and administer pot on behalf of those who are ill. Patients and caregivers would be fingerprinted, undergo background checks and must promise not to sell or give away marijuana. Workers at grow centers and dispensaries will undergo the same vetting.

The state will license 22 growers, one for each State Police district, as well as up to 60 dispensing centers to be spread across the state. Exactly where those growers and sellers could locate will be up to state regulators. Local communities could enforce strict zoning laws, but they could not prevent a grower or dispensary from setting up shop in town.

Growers and dispensaries will be charged a 7 percent ""privilege tax,"" which will be used to enforce the medical marijuana law. Patients will be charged a 1 percent tax for purchasing pot, the same rate that applies to pharmaceuticals. Additionally, growers and dispensaries would be banned from donating to political campaigns.

Marijuana use would be banned in public, in vehicles, around minors and near school grounds. Property owners would have the ability to ban marijuana use on their grounds. Employers would maintain their rights to a drug-free work place, meaning someone with a valid medical marijuana card could be fired for using the drug if their employer prohibits it.

Advocates argue that Illinois' law is drafted tightly enough to prevent intervention from the federal government, which classifies all marijuana use as illegal. But the discrepancy between state and national law is already causing concerns for some military veterans, as federally run veterans hospitals say their doctors won't issue prescriptions for illegal drugs.

Legislators tried to get around that prohibition by providing a loophole in the law that would allow veterans to receive a prescription for pot from someone other than the primary care provider, but advocates say the federal government's stance prevents veterans from having honest conversations about the possible benefits of medical marijuana.

""It presents a pretty big stumbling block for vets,"" said Michael Krawitz, executive director of Veterans for Medical Cannabis Access, a group based near Blacksburg, Va.

Police concerns

Meanwhile, opponents argue that the law will create a public safety hazard on the roads and promote drug use among teens.

The measure was opposed by the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, which noted that the law does not ban medical marijuana patients from driving. The group had suggested that blood and urine testing be included in the legislation to allow police to determine whether cardholders were under the influence of marijuana while driving."

Updated 8/15/2013 at 11:35 a.m. ET

(CNN) – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told a desperate father Wednesday that he will decide by Friday whether or not to sign a medical marijuana bill that would make a version of the drug available to the man's epileptic daughter.

The bill, S2842, was passed by the state assembly June 24 with a large majority in the Democratically-controlled legislature, 55-13, but Christie has so far not said whether or not he will sign it. The measure would expand to children the medical marijuana access already in place for adults.



Brian Wilson is the father of two year-old Vivian, who suffers a version of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. Normal epilepsy medications have so far failed to work for Vivian and her family believes medical marijuana may be able to help.

Father of sick girl to Gov. Christie: Legalize medical marijuana for kids

Trying to get an answer on the bill but unable to get a meeting with the governor, Wilson and members of his family crashed a small Christie campaign stop at a local diner in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. They beseeched the governor to sign the bill and allow for a version of medical marijuana to be administered to Vivian and other children like her.

""I was wondering what the holdup was, it's been like two months now,"" Wilson said to Christie.

Christie responded that while the decision may be simple for Wilson, it's not as simple for the Republican governor. Christie is thought to be a major contender for his party's 2016 nomination for president.

""These are complicated issues,"" Christie told Wilson.

""I know you think it's simple and it's not.""

Christie has in the past expressed trepidation about marijuana. ""I am not going to turn New Jersey into Colorado and California. I'm not legalizing marijuana in New Jersey,"" he said in July.

As for children, Christie said he was ""very reluctant.""

In separate remarks, Christie said that for the medical marijuana bill, ""I'm concerned about expanding the program and I want to make sure that if we do it we do it in a way that is helpful to children,"" Christie said.

Christie worried about going ""down the slippery slope of broadening a program and making it easier to get marijuana that wouldn't necessarily go to other people.""

The Wilson family and their supporters have a website setup called Letters for Vivian where they urge people to write Christie and ask him to support the measure. The letter says that the type of medical marijuana they want for Vivian has no ""high,"" with far less THC than in recreational marijuana. THC is the active ingredient that gets people high.

According to the letter, Vivian has been signed up for medical marijuana but because of her age, she ""has not received any medication due to New Jersey's overreaching and unsafe restrictions"" on the medical marijuana program.

Opinions on the use of marijuana, particularly for medical purposes, have shifted in the United States in recent years, with a growing chorus that it should be made available by prescription.

Why I changed my mind on weed

For his part, Christie promised a response on the medical marijuana bill soon. ""I'll have a decision by Friday,"" he said to Wilson. ""I wish for the best for you, your daughter and your family and I'm going do what I think is best for the people of the state."""
"http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-sanjay-gupta-weed-marijuana-apologize-legal-20130808,0,7697726.story",2013-08-08 21:47:48,['Amina Khan Is A Science Writer At The Los Angeles Times.'],Weed: CNN’s Sanjay Gupta apologizes for anti-marijuana stance,"CNN’s chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta says he regrets his past stance on weed. Gupta, who previously opposed legalizing marijuana, says he’s woken up and smelled the proverbial plant life.

“I apologize because I didn’t look hard enough, until now. I didn’t look far enough,” he wrote in a CNN article. “I didn’t review papers from smaller labs in other countries doing some remarkable research, and I was too dismissive of the loud chorus of legitimate patients whose symptoms improved on cannabis.”

Marijuana was made illegal after assistant Health Secretary Roger Egeberg wrote a letter in 1970, pointing to a “considerable void in our knowledge” about marijuana and that the U.S. should wait to legalize it until there was enough research to “resolve the issue.”

So marijuana was made illegal because of the lack of sound science — but, as Gupta points out, it’s hard to do research in the United States on cannabis when it’s already illegal. And though a fair amount of work is done — more than 20,000 papers just recently, Gupta noted — just 6% of the studies Gupta counted up look at the potential benefits. The rest investigate potential harm, an inherent bias that leads to a profoundly distorted view.

In any case, research outside the U.S. reveals that marijuana has been shown to be effective for medical problems from seizures to neuropathic pain, said Gupta, who is using his research in a documentary called “Weed,” which airs Sunday at 5 p.m. PDT on CNN.

And yet, doctors instead prescribe drugs such as morphine and oxycodone for issues like neuropathic pain, many of which have been shown to to be less than effective and — as a Times series on prescription drug deaths points out — addictive and deadly.

“It is irresponsible not to provide the best care we can as a medical community,” Gupta wrote, “care that could involve marijuana.”

I fully agree.

And yet the editorial is based on the myth that the DEA has made it “nearly impossible” for researchers to obtain marijuana for such scientific studies. To the contrary, not a single scientifically valid study by a qualified researcher has ever been denied by the DEA or, for that matter, by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. And there is ample government-grown marijuana, specifically for research, available at the marijuana farm run by the University of Mississippi. More surprising, as your editorial points out, is that there is still no scientifically valid study that proves that marijuana is effective, much less safe, as a medicine.

As the DEA administrator 20 years ago, I denied the reclassification of marijuana from a Schedule I controlled drug because there were no valid scientific studies showing that smoking marijuana was an effective medicine. In my decision, published in the Federal Register, I interpreted federal law and set forth a five-part test that included whether there were valid scientific studies demonstrating that marijuana was safe and effective for treating any medical condition. I noted that at that time there were none of the kind of controlled, double-blind studies that the Food and Drug Administration would require before approving a new drug application, and I clearly spelled out that this would be necessary before marijuana would be reclassified to a lower schedule that would permit its use as a physician-prescribed medicine.

Essentially, I invited those who advocate marijuana use as a medicine to conduct research and then present it to the DEA. I laid out a road map for what they needed to do. If scientifically valid studies demonstrated that marijuana was “effective” and “safe,” as the FDA defines those terms, the agency would reclassify marijuana into one of the other schedules. It is amazing that 20 years later there is still no such scientific study establishing that marijuana is effective as a medicine. And yet in the interim, the well-funded marijuana lobby, including the National Assn. for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and others, have spent tens of millions of dollars on convincing voters to pass medical marijuana initiatives based on anecdotes but not science.

The reason the FDA and the DEA have scientific standards is because snake-oil salesmen are able to sell just about anything to sick people without any scientific proof that it has a truly helpful therapeutic effect. If proponents of medical marijuana had invested even a small fragment of their money in scientifically valid studies, we would know one way or the other whether it works.

One can only conclude the marijuana proponents did not go this route because doing so would have shown that cannabis is not an effective and safe medicine. Alternatively, we are left to conclude that their agenda was not about marijuana to help sick people, but rather was getting voters to pass medical marijuana initiatives as a wedge to legalize the drug for “recreational” use.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court decided Monday that cities may ban medical marijuana dispensaries through zoning.

The state high court’s unanimous ruling, which approved a ban by the city of Riverside, is expected to spur more such prohibitions around the state. About 200 communities now have zoning laws that exclude cannabis dispensaries.]

During a hearing in February, several justices indicated they favored upholding city bans. The justices’ comments suggested the court would rule that local governments have wide policing powers that state medical marijuana laws have not usurped.

If the court rules in favor of the bans, many more communities are expected to zone dispensaries out of existence.

Supporters of medical cannabis have lamented that patients would be forced to drive hundreds of miles to obtain marijuana legally or be forced to buy illegally.

Californians passed Proposition 215 in 1996, removing state sanctions for patients who use cannabis under a doctor’s recommendation. But the state Legislature failed to adopt regulations for the law, and some cities and counties were inundated with dispensaries before they even began to consider local rules.

Rather than risk lawsuits by regulating, many cities simply adopted zoning ordinances that effectively banned dispensaries. The case before the court involves such a ban by the city of Riverside.

Lower courts have been divided over whether such bans were legal. The Legislature passed a law in 2010 that banned dispensaries near schools and said cities and counties could otherwise regulate their location, operation and establishment.

Advocates of medical cannabis insisted that regulating did not mean banning. They pointed out that the written intent of the state law was to provide uniformity among counties and make medical marijuana available to patients.

Cities and counties countered that the language of the law implied a ban was permissible. They also argued that the state Constitution gave them the right to decide local land use matters.

Gov. Pat Quinn signed the law%2C which is effective Jan. 1

A four-year pilot program will create 60 state-run dispensaries

22 %27cultivation centers%27 where plants are grown will be under strict surveillance

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn signed one of the strictest medical marijuana laws in the nation Thursday, making the state the 20th to legalize the substance.

The measure takes effect Jan. 1 and establishes a four-year pilot program for 60 state-run dispensaries and 22 ""cultivation centers,"" under 24-hour surveillance, where marijuana plants will be grown, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Under the law, doctors will be able to prescribe marijuana for more than 30 specific medical illnesses such as cancer, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, according to CBS Chicago.

''It's very important we do whatever we can to ease their pain,'' Quinn said at a new medical facility at the University of Chicago. ''It's a very well-drafted bill.''

Doctors can't prescribe more than 2.5 ounces over two weeks, the Tribune said. The patient and the doctor must also have an established and ongoing medical relationship.

Illinois' policies are some of the country's strictest, said Chris Lindsey, the legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, an organization devoted to marijuana policy reform in the U.S. Unlike many other states where medical marijuana is legalized, Illinois won't allow users to grow marijuana in their homes.

And, Lindsey said, medical marijuana patients will be both fingerprinted and required to go through a background check. In most states, he said, only growers or providers have to get fingerprinted. There will also be a cap on the number of dispensaries.

Last week, New Hampshire became the 19th state to legalize medical marijuana when Gov. Maggie Hassan signed a bill into law. The District of Columbia also allows medical marijuana, and only two states, Colorado and Washington, have legalized marijuana for recreational use, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

These laws, which mandated lengthy sentences for nonviolent, first-time offenders, were approved 40 years ago next month. They did little to curtail drug use in New York or in other states that mimicked them, while they filled prisons to bursting with nonviolent addicts who would have been more effectively and more cheaply dealt with through treatment programs.

The country is beginning to realize that it cannot enforce or imprison its way out of the addiction problem. But to create broadly accessible and effective treatment strategies for the millions of people who need them, it must abandon the “drug war” approach to addiction that has dominated the national discourse in favor of a policy that treats addiction as a public health issue.

The Affordable Care Act sets the stage for such a transformation by barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, including substance dependency. The administration’s new National Drug Control Strategy — described in a lengthy document promoted by the White House this week — calls for, among other things, community-based drug-prevention approaches that fully integrate treatment with the health care system. President Obama’s budget, meanwhile, calls for a $1.4 billion increase in treatment funding.

To its great credit, New York was one of the first states to back away from the policies it helped to create. In 2009, it revised the Rockefeller laws, with the aim of sending more low-level, nonviolent offenders to treatment instead of to prison. That step leaves it in a good position to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act and create a system for treating drug problems that is free of the poor coordination and interagency conflicts. A timely new report issued by the New York Academy of Medicine and the Drug Policy Alliance, an advocacy group, provides a detailed blueprint for how the state could remake its drug treatment delivery system and remove public policy obstacles to timely and accessible treatment."

With no agreement on a funding bill in sight, Republicans and Democrats continue to spar on Capitol Hill, while federal workers sit at home and the American public watches as an even more critical deadline on raising the federal debt limit nears.

The Senate rejected House amendments to a short-term spending bill Monday, pushing the government toward its first shutdown in nearly two decades.

by Lori Montgomery and Paul Kane

The U.S. government began to shut down for the first time in 17 years early Tuesday, after a Congress bitterly divided over President Obama’s signature health-care initiative failed to reach agreement to fund federal agencies.

Hours before a midnight deadline, the Republican House passed its third proposal in two weeks to fund the government for a matter of weeks. Like the previous plans, the new one sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act, this time by delaying enforcement of the “individual mandate,” a cornerstone of the law that requires all Americans to obtain health insurance.

The new measure also sought to strip lawmakers and their aides of long-standing government health benefits.

The Democratic-led Senate quickly rejected that plan on a party-line vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) urged House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to abandon the assault on the health-care law and pass a simple bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, Reid warned, “the responsibility for this Republican government shutdown will rest squarely on his shoulders.”

Boehner refused to yield. He instead won approval, in a 1 a.m. largely party-line roll call, requesting a special House-Senate committee to meet in the coming days to resolve differences between the two parties, leaving in limbo the fate of millions of federal workers and the services they provide.

Shortly before midnight, the White House budget office issued a memo instructing agencies to “execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.”

The impasse means 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed Tuesday. National parks, monuments and museums, as well as most federal offices, will close. Tens of thousands of air-traffic controllers, prison guards and Border Patrol agents will be required to serve, but their pay may be delayed. And many congressional hearings — including one scheduled for Tuesday on last month’s Washington Navy Yard shootings — will be postponed.

In a last-minute ray of hope for active-duty troops, Congress on Monday approved and sent to the White House an agreement to keep issuing military paychecks. But Obama warned that the broader economy, which is finally starting to recover from the shocks of the past six years, would take a substantial hit if congressional gridlock shutters “America’s largest employer.”

“Keeping the people’s government open is not a concession to me. Keeping vital services running and hundreds of thousands of Americans on the job is not something you ‘give’ to the other side. It’s our basic responsibility,” Obama said in a statement Monday evening at the White House.

Privately, senior Republicans predicted that the closure would last at least a week. A fraction of today’s House Republicans were on Capitol Hill in 1995 and 1996 when a Republican-led Congress last shut down the government in a dispute over the budget with a Democratic president. Younger lawmakers don’t remember the pain the shutdown caused constituents, senior Republicans said. And many of them now question the conventional wisdom that the closures weakened the GOP presidential candidate in 1996 and nearly cost the party control of the House.

Democrats predicted that if the shutdown stretches into the weekend, the government-funding dispute could be rolled into an even more serious battle over the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit. The Treasury Department will begin running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills as soon as Oct. 17 unless Congress approves additional borrowing authority. With so little time remaining to avoid what would be the nation’s first default, Democratic aides predicted that negotiations to reopen the government may be merged into the debt-limit talks.

On Monday evening, Obama telephoned Boehner to urge him to reconsider his stance on the health-care law. In a call that lasted nearly 10 minutes, according to Boehner’s office, the president reiterated his insistence that there would be no negotiations over the debt limit, and that Congress must pay the bills it has incurred.

Boehner responded by mocking Obama in a speech on the House floor.

“ ‘I’m not going to negotiate,’ ” he said, quoting Obama. “I would say to the president: This is not about me. It’s not about Republicans here in Congress. It’s about fairness.”

The speech drew applause for the embattled speaker, who argued passionately that Republicans were merely seeking “fairness” for working people. Obama has delayed a mandate for employers to insure workers and delayed other requirements for big unions, Boehner said. “Yet they stick our constituents with a bill they don’t like and a bill they can’t afford,” he said.

Despite the show of unity, Republicans on both sides of the Capitol remain deeply divided about the attack on the health-care law. In the House, a group of more moderate Republicans was seething about the decision to bow to the forces that oppose the Affordable Care Act, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his allies on the right, including such outside groups as Heritage Action for America.

On Monday, some publicly urged Boehner to drop the issue and seek the help of House Democrats to pass the simple government-funding bill that the Senate approved last week.

“I don’t want to shut down the government,” said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), who is trying to become her state’s first GOP senator since the 1950s, adding that she was inclined to support a “clean” funding bill.

Frustrations also were simmering among Senate Republicans, who complained that House leaders were pressing the attack in direct opposition to public opinion. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly disapprove of using the threat of a shutdown to defund the health-care law and that blame for a shutdown will fall squarely on Republicans.

“By wanting to repeal Obamacare using this method, it defies what the popular will is,” said Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who campaigned last year on behalf of his party’s national ticket.

“I campaigned in 2012 all over this country for months: ‘Repeal and replace Obamacare.’ That was not the mandate of the voters,” McCain said. “If they wanted to repeal Obamacare, the 2012 election would have been probably significantly different.”

Adding to the tension Monday was Boehner’s decision to add the provision that would strip lawmakers, congressional staff members and White House aides of the employer subsidies for health insurance they have received for many years.

Now that lawmakers and their aides must join the new health-insurance exchanges, some conservative groups have criticized the subsidies, worth about $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $10,000 for families, as a “special exemption” from the new law. By including the provision, House leaders hoped to attract conservative support and put pressure on Senate Democrats, who faced the choice of shutting down the government to protect their own perks.

“On what flooding peninsula can you stand when it’s a question of delaying the individual mandate, ending member subsidies and funding the government?” said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.). If Reid kills it, “the senators he’s going to protect become the subject of incredible scrutiny.”

Even some Republicans were uneasy about the prospect of dealing their aides — and some of their colleagues — the equivalent of a big pay cut. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) called it an “outrage,” adding that Boehner had worked directly with Reid and the Obama administration to make sure the subsidies would stay in place when congressional employees join the exchanges next year.

Boehner and his team presented the proposal to rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door meeting Monday. For more than an hour and a half, lawmakers argued about the plan. They emerged with an unusual number of public dissenters, including Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), one of a dozen Republicans who ultimately voted against the proposal.

“I don’t want to be the facilitator of a disastrous process and plan,” he said.

Still, most Republicans endorsed the deal, even if somewhat reluctantly. “I think this is a principled call by leadership and it has the support of the con­ference,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), one of Boehner’s closest friends.

Democrats, meanwhile, were united against any attempt by Republicans to extract concessions now, especially with the larger fight over the debt limit swiftly approaching.

“The bottom line is very simple,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “You negotiate on this, they will up the ante for the debt limit.”

With Defense of Social Safety Net,"Now, as the governor’s image has softened, his poll numbers have improved heading into a re-election race next year against the likely Democratic nominee, Ed FitzGerald, the executive of Cuyahoga County.

He still angers many on the left; he signed a budget in June that cut revenues to local governments and mandates that women seeking an abortion listen to the fetal heartbeat. Democrats see his centrist swing as mere calculation, a prelude to a tough re-election fight.

“This is someone who realized he had to get to the center and chose Medicaid as the issue,” said Danny Kanner, communications director of the Democratic Governors Association. “That doesn’t erase the first three years of his governorship when he pursued polices that rewarded the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.”

Ohioans earning in the top 1 percent will see a $6,000 tax cut under the latest budget passed by the Republican-led legislature, while those in the bottom fifth will see a $12 increase, according to Policy Matters Ohio, an independent research group.

The governor dismissed the notion that his Medicaid decision was political. “I have an opportunity to do good, to lift people, and that’s what I’m going to do,” he said. “You know what?” he added, using a phrase he utters before aiming a jab. “Let the chips fall where they may.”

He has often showed an independent streak. He supported President Bill Clinton’s assault weapons ban while in Congress in 1994, and he teamed with Ralph Nader to close corporate tax loopholes.

In the interview in his office, he criticized a widespread conservative antipathy toward government social programs, which regards the safety net as enabling a “culture of dependency.”"

He Died On June']",Charles Krauthammer: Obama the oblivious,"In explaining the disastrous rollout of Obamacare, President Obama told Chris Matthews he had discovered that “we have these big agencies, some of which are outdated, some of which are not designed properly.”

An interesting discovery to make after having consigned the vast universe of American medicine, one-sixth of the U.S. economy, to the tender mercies of the agency bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service.

Most people become aware of the hopeless inefficiency of sclerotic government by, oh, age 17 at the department of motor vehicles. Obama’s late discovery is especially remarkable considering that he built his entire political philosophy on the rock of Big Government, on the fervent belief in the state as the very engine of collective action and the ultimate source of national greatness. (Indeed, of individual success as well, as in “If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”)

This blinding revelation of the ponderous incompetence of bureaucratic government came just a few weeks after Obama confessed that “what we’re also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy.” Another light bulb goes off, this one three years after passing a law designed to force millions of Americans to shop for new health plans via the maze of untried, untested, insecure, unreliable online “exchanges.”

This discovery joins a long list that includes Obama’s rueful admission that there really are no shovel-ready jobs. That one came after having passed his monstrous $830 billion stimulus on the argument that the weakened economy would be “jump-started” by a massive infusion of shovel-ready jobs. Now known to be fictional.

Barack Obama is not just late to discover the most elementary workings of government. With alarming regularity, he professes obliviousness to the workings of his own government. He claims, for example, to have known nothing about the IRS targeting scandal, the AP phone records scandal, the NSA tapping of Angela Merkel. And had not a clue that the centerpiece of his signature legislative achievement — the online Obamacare exchange, three years in the making — would fail catastrophically upon launch. Or that Obamacare would cause millions of Americans to lose their private health plans.

Hence the odd spectacle of a president expressing surprise and disappointment in the federal government — as if he’s not the one running it. Hence the repeated no-one-is-more-upset-than-me posture upon deploring the nonfunctioning Web site, the IRS outrage, the AP intrusions and any number of scandals from which Obama tries to create safe distance by posing as an observer. He gives the impression of a man on a West Wing tour trying out the desk in the Oval Office, only to be told that he is president of the United States.

The paradox of this presidency is that this most passive bystander president is at the same time the most ideologically ambitious in decades. The sweep and scope of his health-care legislation alone are unprecedented. He’s spent billions of tax money attempting to create, by fiat and ex nihilo, a new green economy. His (failed) cap-and-trade bill would have given him regulatory control of the energy economy. He wants universal preschool and has just announced his unwavering commitment to slaying the dragon of economic inequality, which, like the poor, has always been with us.

Obama’s discovery that government bureaucracies don’t do things very well creates a breathtaking disconnect between his transformative ambitions and his detachment from the job itself. How does his Olympian vision coexist with the lassitude of his actual governance, a passivity that verges on absenteeism?

What bridges that gap is rhetoric. Barack Obama is a master rhetorician. It’s allowed him to move crowds, rise inexorably and twice win the most glittering prize of all. Rhetoric has changed his reality. For Obama, it can change the country’s. Hope and change, after all, is a rhetorical device. Of the kind Obama has always imagined can move mountains.

That’s why his reaction to the Obamacare Web site’s crash-on-takeoff is so telling. His remedy? A cross-country campaign-style speaking tour. As if rhetoric could repeal that reality.

Managing, governing, negotiating, cajoling, crafting legislation, forging compromise. For these — this stuff of governance — Obama has shown little aptitude and even less interest. Perhaps, as Valerie Jarrett has suggested, he is simply too easily bored to invest his greatness in such mundanity.

There was impasse after impasse, heated rhetoric on both sides and talk of an economic catastrophe. On Wednesday, things finally settled down with a bipartisan deal. Here are some basic questions and answers about what’s going on:

What’s happened?

On Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate reached a deal to open the government and to raise the debt ceiling through early next year. The House and Senate approved the bill Wednesday night, to be followed by a promised signature from President Obama — ending a two-part crisis.

The first part started Oct. 1, when the government partially shut down, closing federal agencies and furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers.

Senate leaders announced a budget compromise Wednesday that will raise the debt ceiling and re-open the government. In Play's Chris Cillizza breaks down which political players came out of the deal on top and which ones did not. (The Washington Post)

The second part was the fight over raising the debt ceiling, a legal limit on how much the government can borrow. If the limit is not raised in a timely fashion, the government will default on its obligations, which include Social Security payments and payments to investors in government debt.

What will the deal do?

The deal has five main parts:

●Immediately reopens the government and funds it through Jan. 15.

●Raises the debt ceiling through Feb. 7 but allows federal borrowing to continue for a few weeks longer, using special accounting measures.

●Requires additional measures, favored by Republicans, to ensure that people who receive financial help to buy medical insurance under the new health-care law are being honest about their income.

●Sets up a negotiating committee to try to come up with a longer-term budget plan so we don’t go through this again early next year. The committee is expected to issue budget recommendations by Dec. 13.

●Provides back pay to furloughed federal workers.

When will federal agencies reopen?

As early as Thursday in most cases.

When will federal workers get back pay?

Uncertain, but as soon as possible.

So with Obama’s signature, is this truly over?

Yes.

Why has this taken so long?

There are two reasons.

1. Democracy.

2. A group of conservative tea party Republicans in the House wanted to halt or delay Obama’s health-care law to keep the government functioning.

But there won’t actually be major changes to the health-care law in the deal?

Right.

Who won, and who lost?

It seems pretty clear in this round of the budget wars, Obama and the Democrats outmaneuvered their Republican opponents.

House Republicans decided to shut down the government in hopes of major changes to the health-care law, but none were in the offing. Senate Republicans reluctantly went along with that strategy — at least for a while. In the meantime, the GOP brand was badly beaten up in the polls.

Prognosticators now say that Republicans could have a hard time winning the Senate in 2014, even though the electoral map is stacked against the Democrats. But the House still looks safe for the GOP.

Meanwhile, Obama and fellow Democrats stuck to their view that they would not pay a “ransom” to accomplish the basic tasks of keeping the government open and raising the debt limit.

Hold up — wasn’t Obama forced to compromise to raise the debt ceiling and open the government?

Not really. Obama gave the flimsiest of fig leaves to the Republicans: a promise to do a better job ensuring that people who report their income to get help buying health insurance are reporting their income properly. There were already some assurances in the health-care law, so all the president promised was an additional layer of scrutiny.

So is it all wonderful for Obama and Democrats?

Again, not really. For all the drama, they got little out of this deal. They won’t be rolling back the deep spending cuts known as the sequester that took effect earlier this year and are eating away at domestic priorities, including education and research and development. They won’t be getting new money to spend on jobs or an immigration bill.

They just got a political win. And they avoided an economic disaster.

What happens next?

Per the outlines of the agreement, Republicans and Democrats will assign lawmakers to a committee to hash out a broader budget plan for the coming year. These joint efforts have not had success in the recent past.

But hope dies hard. For Democrats and Republicans alike, the basic question in the committee will be whether they can find a way to roll back the sequester, which is due to launch a new round of budget cuts in January.

Democrats hate the sequester because it’s basically the opposite of their vision of domestic investment. Republicans are more ambivalent, but there are many in the GOP who don’t like how deeply it cuts Pentagon spending.

The most likely path to replacing part of the sequester is to instead make cuts to mandatory spending, such as health-care programs or farm subsidies. On a practical level, Republicans and Democrats agree that mandatory spending is better to cut, because it’s the long-term driver of debt. But it also has entrenched constituencies, such as the elderly or farmers, which makes such cuts difficult to achieve.

A bigger budget deal — the elusive “grand bargain” — could also be considered as part of the committee’s talks. But any discussion of significant changes to mandatory spending usually leads Democrats to insist on new taxes, which has been a deal-breaker for the GOP.

What happens if the committee fails to come to an agreement and we’re back in January with new deadlines?

There could be a big, new fight — like we’ve just experienced — or neither side will want another fight with the midterm elections fast approaching. So they’ll just extend everything once again, leaving sequester cuts in place, and the voters will decide what they want come November."

That was before there was any welfare state at all. How many people starved? No one.” “Right, good point,” Doocy agreed.

Really John? No one starved to death during the Great Depression? That's not how a lot of people remember those years.



In the Pennsylvania coal fields, three or four families crowded together in one-room shacks and lived on wild weeds. In Arkansas, families were found inhabiting caves. In Oakland, California, whole families lived in sewer pipes. President Herbert Hoover declared, ""Nobody is actually starving. The hoboes are better fed than they have ever been."" But in New York City in 1931, there were 20 known cases of starvation; in 1934, there were 110 deaths caused by hunger. There were so many accounts of people starving in New York that the West African nation of Cameroon sent $3.77 in relief.

We will never know how many people died as a result of starvation or illness related to malnutrition during the years of the Great Depression because there were no official Federal Government statistics for that era. [Deleted reference to Russian researcher] However, there is enough anecdotal evidence that people did starve during the Great Depression, and that contrary to what Mr. Stossel asserts now, and President Hoover asserted then, people did in fact die from lack of adequate food intake, otherwise known as death by starvation. We certainly have a photographic record of people who look very thin and malnourished as evidence that starvation was a reality for many people during the Depression:

We also know that food riots broke out in many states. Well fed people, or even adequately fed people do not riot over food. Hungry, starving people on the other hand do:

Feb. 1931 ""Food riots"" begin to break out in parts of the U.S. In Minneapolis, several hundred men and women smashed the windows of a grocery market and made off with fruit, canned goods, bacon, and ham. One of the store's owners pulled out a gun to stop the looters, but was leapt upon and had his arm broken. The ""riot"" was brought under control by 100 policemen. Seven people were arrested.

And another food riot incident, this time in Oklahoma:

From the New York Times, January 31, 1931. Food Rioters Raid Oklahoma City Store; 500 Dispersed by the Police With Tear Gas OKLAHOMA CITY. Jan. 20 (AP)-A crowd of men and women, shouting that they were hungry and jobless, raided a grocery store near the City Hall today. Twenty-six of the men were arrested. Scores loitered near the city jail following the arrests, but kept well out of range of fire hoses made ready for use in case of another disturbance. The police tonight broke up a second meeting of about one hundred unemployed men and arrested Francis Owens, alleged head of the ""Oklahoma City Unemployed Council,"" who was accused of instigating the raid.

People starved Mr. Stossel. They went hungry. Some of them, we don't know how many, died, either from the direct effects of starvation or from malnutrition and illnesses related to their lowered resistance to disease caused by, yes, starvation. And guess what? More people would be dying today if we didn't have social welfare programs such as SNAP (i.e., food stamps) to prevent poor people, and the unemployed from going without food. Yet you want to eliminate these programs. In fact you stated that you wanted to eliminate the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Education, among others.

You cut whole departments,” the Fox Business host explained. “Why do we have a Commerce Department? Commerce just happens! Agriculture, farmers do that! You don’t need bureaucrats.” He added that the Department of Education was also unnecessary. “Isn’t that part of what the government does in a lot of people minds?” Fox News host Steve Doocy asked. “They need to help people rather than let people help themselves?”

Guess what you left off your list? The entire Department of Defense. Well hell's bells, why do we need a wasteful military establishment when we have an armed militia available? Using your logic, our military forces are completely unnecessary, because individuals can take care of that themselves when it comes to national defense. Just like social welfare programs are unnecessary. Please let me know, from your libertarian perspective, why the largest Department in the Federal Government and the one whose elimination, or even significant down-sizing, would solve most of our debt issues going forward is left off your list. I'm dying to find out why you failed to mention it, though you have no problem with killing off social welfare programs that millions of your fellow citizens depend upon.

UPDATE: Further evidence of the effects of starvation among the poor in the United States during the Great Depression era and the years leading up to it (i.e., before the development of our current socialist hellhole welfare state) can be found at the Link (h/t to mollyd from the comments.

UPDATE 2: Stossel has issued a classic nopology:

This morning, on Fox and Friends, I said ""no one"" starved during the Depression. I was almost certainly wrong. During the Depression, the governor of Pennsylvania wrote, ""we know that starvation is widespread, but no one has enumerated the starving."" However, all other governors who wrote to Congress, 43 of them, sent letters saying that they knew of no starvation in their states. Historians Steven Mintz and Sara McNeil wrote that there were hundreds of deaths in NYC alone. However, hunger was rare enough that health in America generally improved during the Depression, according to a National Academy of Sciences study [...] There's no doubt that there was privation of all sorts in the 30's - when America was much poorer. But today's reduction in malnutrition is almost entirely a result of greater prosperity, thanks to our relatively free market. Our unsustainable welfare state causes poverty (by rewarding dependency) as often as it relieves it. Stopping government handouts to people like ME won't lead to starvation.



Stossel forgets to mention that part of that ""improvement"" was related to advances in medicine, and part only looked like improvement, since the 1918-1920 ""Spanish Flu"" epidemic which killed millions skewed the statistics by making the pre-Roaring Twenties look very deadly in comaparison. He also forgets that under FDR, federal funding for vaccinations increased significantly under FERA (the Federal Emergency Relief Administration) which in all likelihood led to better health outcomes and fewer childhood deaths."
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/us/politics/obamas-approval-rating-matches-two-year-low-poll-shows.html,2013-09-26 00:00:00,"['Jonathan Martin', 'Allison Kopicki']","Obama’s Approval Rating Matches Two-Year Low, Poll Shows","Mr. Obama has been adamant that he will not link any other budget issues to the debt ceiling increase, while Congressional Republicans are demanding he compromise with them to raise the ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Wednesday in a letter to Speaker John A. Boehner that the debt limit would be reached “no later than” Oct. 17.

While Mr. Obama’s ratings sag, he can take some solace in the standing of the Republican opposition in Congress. Nearly three-quarters of Americans disapprove of Congressional Republicans. More of the public supports Mr. Obama than Republicans to make the right decisions on the deficit, health care and the economy.

“I would blame the Republicans for a shutdown,” said Barbara Nemeth, 70, an independent in Port Richey, Fla. “It’s not their job to stalemate the government. It’s their job to work cooperatively and compromise. That has been traditionally the American democratic way. They are acting like a bunch of overgrown, spoiled brats.”

But there is little doubt that the president is being hurt by questions over his health overhaul. Only one in five Americans say they expect to be positively affected by the law.

The survey also suggests that Republicans could pay a political price going into next year’s midterm elections if there is a government shutdown. Eight in 10 Americans find it unacceptable for either the president or members of Congress to shut down the government to achieve their goals during budget negotiations. And while half the country sees Mr. Obama as working with Republicans, only one in four Americans see Congressional Republicans as working with the president to get things done.

A plurality say they would blame Congressional Republicans if a shutdown occurred.

“It’s bad on both sides,” said Gerald Muller, 86, an independent from Austin, Tex. “President Obama is not checking with experts. He’s a man who has been working alone and he’s isolated himself and now he has no one to turn to, or he won’t turn to them. He has a lot of learning to do, in my opinion. And the Republicans have their own agenda. They are kind of stubborn and don’t seem willing to compromise.”"

The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. That’s what tax reform can deliver. That’s what we can do together.

I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won’t be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let’s set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Let’s agree, right here, right now, to keep the people’s government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.

Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. But let’s be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?

A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs. I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge this Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat – nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.

Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.

After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.

There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There’s no reason this can’t happen in other towns. So tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America.

If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s; developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy."

http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/13/1193824/-I-Read-Paul-Ryan-s-Budget,2013-03-13 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",I Read Paul Ryan's Budget,"General impressions. Before I get into specifics, I want to say a few things about the overall impression the document makes

As many people have already observed, Ryan's proposal is not an attempt to reach a workable compromise with the White House or the Democratic majority in the Senate, both of which would have to agree before his plan could become law. Instead, it's an aspirational document for conservatives: This is what they fantasize about doing if and when they get complete control of the government.

There's nothing wrong with that, but there's also no reason to take it any more seriously than an aspirational budgets from the Left, like People's Budget put out by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Both are shots across the bow, not plausible projections of what the country will do in FY2014 and beyond.

The write-up is a rallying cry for the troops of the conservative movement, not an attempt to convince or convert the non-believers. The summary (page 7) says ""It invites President Obama and Senate Democrats to commit to the same common-sense goal [of a balanced budget in ten years]"" but there is no spirit-of-invitation in Ryan's style. Any liberal who reads it will get pissed off, and I believe that's intentional. Conservatives couldn't fully enjoy their reading experience without visualizing pissed-off liberals.

Let me detail that: You've probably already heard that Ryan wants (once again) to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. ObamaCare). But after the first mention, he can't just call the law by name, or even nickname. It's ""the President's onerous health care law"" (page 33) or ""the President's misguided health care law"" (page 40) and so on, as if the ACA had been imposed on the country by imperial decree and Congress had nothing to say about it -- also as if the ACA hadn't been an issue in the 2012 election that Romney/Ryan lost by nearly five million votes.

Other partisan stuff is just silly. On page 24, President Reagan is given credit both for the economic expansion of his era, and of President Clinton's era as well. Clinton is mentioned exactly once, on page 33, when Ryan re-raises the universally debunked lie from campaign 2012 that Obama wants to rescind the work requirement of Clinton's welfare reform. The reader would never know that Ryan's stated goal -- a balanced budget -- was achieved by Clinton while Reagan ran up record deficits.

You will also hear echoes of 2009's Lie of the Year: death panels. The ACA sets up an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make annual recommendations on keeping Medicare spending within specified limits. The law specifically bans the IPAB from recommending care-rationing, but the heading of the Ryan's section on it (page 40) is ""Repeal the health-care rationing board"".

Background assumptions. In the real world, if a program is important enough, the government could conceivably raise taxes or borrow to pay for it. OK, Ryan's balanced-budget goal won't let him advocate borrowing. But a fundamental assumption that runs through his whole budget -- usually without being stated explicitly -- is that taxes cannot be raised for any purpose. Nothing is important enough to raise taxes to pay for.

Also, defense spending is untouchable. ""There is no foreseeable ‘peace dividend’ on our horizon."" (page 61)

So if the domestic demands on government are growing -- the population is getting older, the infrastructure more decrepit, healthcare more expensive, weather-related disasters more extreme and more frequent, future economic growth more dependent basic research and an educated workforce etc. -- any money you want to spend to deal with one of those challenges has to be taken from the others.

The idea that over the long term our country could decide that it wants to do more of its consumption publicly -- that it wants to take economic growth in the form of Medicare and public education, say, rather than BMWs -- that's completely off the table.

Big Picture. The numbers don't appear until the Appendix (page 80). Atlantic's Derek Thompson put the ten-year cut totals into a bar graph and a pie chart.

Social Security: $0

Defense: $0

Medicare: $129 billion

Discretionary: $249 billion

Interest: $700 billion

Medicaid/other health: $756 billion

Mandatory spending: $962 billion

Obamacare: $1.837 trillion

Medicare and Social Security are usually considered ""mandatory spending"" (because benefits are defined by law rather than by appropriation), but I believe the additional $962 billion of 10-year savings is Food Stamps, Pell grants, and a variety of other people-helping programs.

So the cuts are almost entirely in healthcare, education, or anti-poverty spending.

Meanwhile, rich people get a big bonanza: The top tax rate drops from the current 39.6% to 25%. If you make $10 million some year (some CEOs do), that could save you nearly $1.5 million.

It's also worthwhile to consider what isn't in the budget document.



Any specifics about discretionary spending cuts. The cuts are just numbers on a spreadsheet. All the ""tough choices"" necessary to achieve those numbers are left to your imagination, so Ryan can deny any intention to cut anything in particular, as Mitt Romney did in his first debate with President Obama.

Any specifics about closing tax loopholes. Ryan claims his rich-guys-bonanza 25% tax rate wouldn't cut federal revenue, because it would be balanced by eliminating tax loopholes. As in the 2012 campaign, Ryan says nothing about what those loopholes might be. Again, he can deny wanting to cut any specific item, like the mortgage interest deduction. But he's got to raise that revenue somehow, and I seriously doubt it's all going to come from the super-rich who benefit most from the lower rate.

But he's got to raise that revenue somehow, and I seriously doubt it's all going to come from the super-rich who benefit most from the lower rate. Any plan for Social Security. Page 37 charges: ""In Social Security, government’s refusal to deal with demographic realities has endangered the solvency of this critical program."" But rather than ""deal with demographic realities"" here and now, Ryan only ""requires the President and Congress to work together to forge a solution.""

The background rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul assumption allows Ryan to construct some truly Orwellian statements. This is particularly true in the ""Opportunity Extended"" section, which is all about shrinking opportunity for poor and working-class young people.

For example, on page 20 Ryan identifies ""tuition inflation"" as a problem that ""plung[es] students and their families into unaffordable levels of debt"". And then he says:

Many economists, including Ohio University’s Richard Vedder*, argue that the structure of the federal government’s aid programs don’t simply chase higher tuition costs, but are in fact a key driver of those costs.

What could that possibly mean? Well, that federal aid is allowing too many people to go to college, creating a high-demand environment in which colleges can raise tuition. So the ""solution"" is to lower the maximum Pell grant (thereby ""saving"" the Pell grant program from spending at an ""unsustainable"" level, since we couldn't possibly raise taxes to pay for it). Also to ""target aid to the truly needy"" by making families report more of their income on financial aid forms. Also ""reforming"" student loans and ""re-examining the data made available to students to make certain they are armed with information that will assist them in making their postsecondary decisions"".

Presumably, when the facts of this harsher you're-on-your-own world are spelled out to students, fewer of them will decide to go to college, thereby saving both their money and the government's. So don't worry about student debt -- just don't go to college at all if you're not rich, and if you do go we'll ""help"" you avoid massive debts by refusing to loan you money.

Oh, and we'll also ""encourage innovation"" through ""nontraditional models like online coursework"". Never mind that's where the big scams are. Corporations profit from those scams, so that's not ""waste"".

Ditto for job training: Ryan promises to ""extend opportunity"" by spending less on it.

Ditto for the safety net. Since taxes can't possibly be raised, every person who is helped by the safety net is taking those dollars away from somebody else who might be helped. So Ryan's ""A Safety Net Strengthened"" section is all about spending less on the safety net. Mostly this is accomplished by block-granting programs like Medicaid to give ""states more flexibility to tailor programs to their people’s needs.""

So if, say, low-income Texans need to toughen up and stop seeing a doctor at all, Texas can tailor its program that way. That's what it's doing already with the ""flexibility"" the Supreme Court gave it last summer.

Energy. Climate change just isn't happening. Ryan doesn't say that in so many words, but there's a big empty spot where that idea would be.

He clumps energy together with a grab-bag of other issues in the ""Fairness Restored"" section. The ""unfairness"" in this case is the way that the Obama administration favors clean energy over dirty energy. Ryan will ""end kickbacks to favored industries"" like wind and solar in favor of ""reliable, low-cost energy"" like coal, oil, and gas. With climate change out of the picture, only corruption can explain Obama's favoritism. In his Introduction -- signed ""Paul"" -- Ryan says his budget ""restores fair play to the marketplace by ending cronyism.""

In current energy policy, fossil fuels and green energy are subsidized in different ways: Green energy gets grants and loans while established-and-profitable fossil energy gets tax breaks. Tax breaks are invisible to Ryan, so he can say on page 50:

on a dollar-per-unit-of-production basis, the level of subsidies received by the wind and solar industries were almost 100 times greater than those for conventional energy

So what's the purpose of all this? A better world for our children. ""By living beyond our means, we're stealing from the next generation."" (page 5)

Of course you know how that works, because all that debt America ran up during World War II was ""stolen"" from us, right?

Or maybe you didn't notice, because in the real America, the big deficits of World War II kicked off half a century of prosperity, during which the country achieved a level of equality that it hasn't equalled before or since. So no, deficits are not ""stolen"" from the future. We're not building landing crafts and putting them in time machines to send them back to D-Day.

But in order to save our children from the horrible maybe-sorta-problem of the national debt, we need to under-educate them; not do basic research that might create the next Internet; leave them crumbling roads, bridges, and electrical grids; not care for them when they get sick; move in with them when we get old; and leave them with a torched planet, where Iowa is a desert and Miami is underwater.

I'm sure they'll thank us for our foresight.

Paul Ryan wants people to take his budget manifestos seriously, he should be honest about his ambition: not so much to make the federal government fiscally sustainable as to make it smaller.

You will recall that the Ryan Budget was a big Republican selling point in last year’s election. Most famously, Ryan proposed turning Medicare into a voucher program. He offered the usual GOP recipe of tax cuts — to be offset by closing certain loopholes, which he would not specify — along with drastic reductions in non-defense “discretionary” spending.

If the plan Ryan offered had been enacted, the federal budget would not come into balance until 2040. For some reason, Republicans forgot to mention this detail in their stump speeches and campaign ads.

Voters were supposed to believe that Ryan was an apostle of fiscal rectitude. But his real aim wasn’t to balance the budget. It was to starve the federal government of revenue. Big government, in his worldview, is inherently bad — never mind that we live in an awfully big country.

Ryan and Mitt Romney offered their vision, President Obama offered his, and Americans made their choice. Rather emphatically.

Now Ryan, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, is coming back with an ostensibly new and improved version of the framework that voters rejected in November. Judging by the preview he offered Sunday, the new plan is even less grounded in reality than was the old one.

Voters might not have focused on the fact that Ryan’s original plan wouldn’t have produced a balanced budget until today’s high school students reached middle age, but the true deficit hawks in the House Republican caucus certainly noticed. They demanded a budget that reached balance much sooner. Hence Ryan’s revised plan, which claims to accomplish this feat of equilibrium within a decade.

It will, in fact, do nothing of the sort, because it appears to depend on at least one ridiculous assumption and two glaring contradictions. That’s for starters; I’m confident we’ll see more absurdities when the full proposal is released soon.

Appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” Ryan said his plan assumes that the far-reaching reforms known as Obamacare will be repealed. Host Chris Wallace reacted with open disbelief: “That’s not going to happen.”

Indeed, to take Ryan seriously is to believe that legislation repealing the landmark Affordable Care Act would be approved by the Senate, with its Democratic majority, and signed by Obama. What are the odds? That’s a clown question, bro.

As he did in the campaign, Ryan attacked Obama’s health reforms for cutting about $700 billion from Medicare over a decade, not by slashing benefits but by reducing payments to providers. Ryan neglected to mention that his own budget — the one he convinced the party to run on in 2012 — would cut Medicare by the same amount. Actually, by a little more.

This was hypocrisy raised to high art. How could anyone who claimed to be so very worried about the crushing federal debt blithely renounce $700 billion in savings? Ryan suggested Sunday that once Obamacare is repealed, this money can be plowed back into Medicare. Which, as you recall, will never happen.

Ann Telnaes animation: John Boehner talks about fairness. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

While Ryan’s new budget assumes that Obamacare goes away, it also assumes that the tax increase on high earners approved in the “fiscal cliff” deal remains in place. “That’s current law,” he said, as if Obamacare were not.

Ryan’s sudden respect for a tax increase that had to be — metaphorically — crammed down Republicans’ throats is easily explained. He needs the $600 billion in revenue it produces to make his new fantasyland budget appear to reach balance.

Ryan is likely to reprise — and even augment — the hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts he proposed last year for social programs. He indicated that he still believes Medicare should be voucherized, although he objects to the word and insists that what he advocates is “premium support.” And he asserted that Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor, is “reckless” — even as tea party-approved Republican governors such as Rick Scott of Florida announce their states’ participation.

From the evidence, Ryan cares less about deficits or tax rates than about finding some way to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government. He has every right to hold that view. But it’s hard to take him seriously as long as he refuses to come clean about his intentions.

Senate Democrats and President Obama quickly made it clear they had no intention of going along, putting the government on a course toward a shutdown unless one side relents.

The 230-to-189 party-line vote in a bitterly divided House set in motion a fiscal confrontation with significant implications — politically and economically — but with an uncertain ending. Without a resolution, large parts of the government could shut down Oct. 1, and a first-ever default on federal debt could follow weeks later.

Each side predicted that the other would be held responsible, but determined House Republicans knew they were taking a risk even as leaders of the party’s establishment warned about the threat of destructive political consequences.

Mr. Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner on Friday evening but only to reiterate that he would not negotiate with him on raising the federal debt limit and said it was Congress’s constitutional obligation to pay the nation’s bills. Both sides described the call as brief and fruitless."

Treasury SecretaryJacob Lew, appearing in a series of Sunday television interviews, predicted the U.S. would likely hit its statutory borrowing limit, now $16.7 trillion, sometime after Labor Day. If lawmakers fail to lift the cap, the U.S. will be unable to borrow money to pay all its bills. [...] Republicans, for their part, in the talks have suggested changes to Medicare, including switching to a slower-growing gauge of inflation that would reduce benefits, and ""means-testing"" the program by charging well-to-do senior citizens higher premiums. In the past, Mr. Obama has said he could consider both ideas as part of a larger deal. Republicans also proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare, a concept the White House dislikes. [...] The meetings have been relatively informal, with Republicans offering ideas for where to find budget savings which, if implemented, could diminish the across-the-board cuts to the budget.

President Obama is going to try to flip the idea of his Grand Bargain with a new trade of taxes for jobs. But that doesn't mean Grand Bargain 1.0, entitlement cuts for taxes, isn't still proceeding on a separate track. It is. The bullshit caucus , the Republican senators who went around leader Mitch McConnell to broker a filibuster deal with Harry Reid, are still being wooed by senior administration staff, including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and it still puts Medicare and Social Security on the chopping block Great. Republicans have ruled out new tax revenue and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough ""and other senior aides"" are still meeting with them, still offering up benefits cuts from Medicare and Social Security [the ""slower-growing gauge of inflation"" would be the chained CPI for Social Security, not Medicare as the story suggests]. Once upon a time, President Obama promised no entitlement cuts unless he got revenue. And yet, here we still are with benefit cuts on the table and no new taxes on the table. Now he's negotiating for adjustments to the tax code, which Republicans will probably insist on making revenue neutral.

With his latest pivot to the economy, and a renewed focus on income inequality and the middle class and jobs, the last thing President Obama should be doing is offering up these programs—which are so vital to the income security of the majority of seniors—for cuts. Especially when he's making the offer to Republicans who are as intractable on revenue as ever."
http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/21/1249471/-Estate-Recovery-It-s-Worse-Than-You-Thought,2013-10-21 00:00:00,"['This Content Is Not Subject To Review Daily Kos Staff Prior To Publication.', 'Backgroundurl Avatar_Large', 'Nickname', 'Joined', 'Created_At', 'Story Count', 'N_Stories', 'Comment Count', 'N_Comments', 'Popular Tags']",It's Worse Than You Thought.,"Our story so far: those who enroll in Medicaid through the ACA Medicaid Expansion will find that there is no limit on the assets they can have, as long as their income is low enough to qualify.

Unfortunately, there is also no limit to the amount that can be billed against the Medicaid recipient's assets by the state. And Estate Recovery seeks a 100% payback of whatever each state determines are expenses they want to recover for. In other words, if you are 55-64, and depending on what state you are in and what services you use, Medicaid may not be an insurance program: it is a loan.



While it seems a lot of people are under the impression that Estate Recovery is only for long term care, this is not the case in many states. Hat tip to Phoebe Loosinhouse, who provided this link in a comment in the previous diary:

For those who want to submerge themselves in a real wonkfest AARP Medicaid Estate Recovery, a 2004 Survey of State Programs and Practices.

According to an AARP chart, states that seek to recover ALL costs, possibly including ""capitation charges"" (more on that in a minute) include:

AL, AZ, CA, DE, FL, HI, IL, IN, IA, KY, ME, MD, MN, MT, NE, NH, NJ, NY, ND, OH, OK, OR, RI, TN, UT, VA.

So on to some interesting articles I have been reading. Here's one:

Estates could owe Medicaid in which Beth Duffy writes:



For the sake of the 15 million individuals expected to accept their states’ forms of Medicaid expansion health care programs commencing this autumn — including a projected 150,000 Iowans — I hope they ask, “Hey, does this mean my estate is subject to Medicaid rules and therefore must reimburse the government for my health care benefits when I die?”

Will Iowa’s new federally mandated program perpetuate Medicaid’s status of “statutory loan program” subject to debt-obligation and estate reimbursement? If so, Medicaid expansion could unintentionally create a tragic new cycle of poverty.

And Professor Duffy concludes:If you're thinking that it should be easy and straightforward to get information on a state's Estate Recovery policies and procedures, guess again:

In Medicaid Estate Recovery Mystification, Attorney John Payne writes:



One of the core principles of government in the United States is transparency. Freedom of the press and laws that require government agencies to provide information to citizens on request are considered essential to keeping our bureaucrats, mandarins, syndics and pashas more honest than they might otherwise be. However, as in many states, Michigan Department of Human Services and Department of Community Health, which administer welfare programs, are exempt from the public notice and open meetings laws that govern other departments.

And now about those those pesky capitation charges:

Dr. Jane M. Orient writes in Medicaid is a tax on the estates of the poor:



In Arizona, where all Medicaid beneficiaries are enrolled in a managed-care plan, their estates could be repaying “benefits” even if the enrollee never actually received any goods or services. Information provided by the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (Arizona’s Medicaid program) explains that the program makes a monthly capitation payment of around $3,340 to “program contractors,” who arrange for services, if any. It warns, in bold print: “It is important to be aware that capitation payments can exceed the actual costs of services provided during the month.”

Medicaid, supposed to be a program to help the poor, has become a cash cow for multibillion-dollar, managed-care companies, who milk federal and state taxpayers. Expanding Medicaid to persons with modest assets will enable estate recovery to become a cash cow for states to milk the poor and the middle class.

In a curious exercise of age discrimination, the recovery program only applies to people who are over age 55. Essentially, estate recovery turns government financial help to frail seniors of modest means into a loan program with collection taking place at death. If Medicaid helped pay for any of your care, your estate will be forced to repay the government after you die. Estate recovery is a Medicaid “death tax” imposed only on the elderly. The program has been referred to as “picking the bones of the poor,” and “sucking the last ounce of blood from the corpse.”

Dr. Orient concludes:Elderlaw attorney Jeffrey Marshall writes in: Medicaid Estate Recovery - A Medicaid Death Tax In case you're thinking: well, this isn't so bad - it won't affect you until you're dead, right? Not so fast.

Here's a piece by Carol J. Wessels, who is an attorney in Wisconsin: Will Medicaid Recipients Ever be Able to Sell Their Homes Under Wisconsin’s New Budget Law?

A summary of the Kafkaesque system she describes wouldn't make much sense. As with the rest of these articles, it's best to just go read the whole thing. At the end of it she asks:



This causes me to wonder why the state is taking such draconian steps against elderly individuals, just because they had the foresight to invest in the American Dream, a home. An individual who was less frugal, frittered money away and did not invest in a home, would receive the same Medicaid benefits, and not be penalized for being a homeowner. Even more offensive is that as far as I can tell, a homeowner can commit a crime and go to prison, receive food, housing and medical care there, which the State is required to provide, and still come out with no lien on their home. If I am wrong about that, I hope someone will point it out. Said another way, should Wisconsin treat its frail elderly worse than criminals? I guess our legislature thinks so.

Thanks for reading. Let's keep the discussion going."

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio: ""Promise after promise from this administration has turned out to be not true. So when it comes to this health care law, the White House doesn't have much credibility. Let's be clear: The only way to fully protect the American people is to scrap this law once and for all. There is no way to fix this.""

President Obama, White House news conference: ""I am confident that by the time we look back on this next year, that people are going to say this is working well, and it's helping a lot of people. But my intention in terms of winning back the confidence of the American people is just to work as hard as I can, identify the problems that we've got, make sure that we're fixing them. Whether it's a website, whether it is making sure that folks who got these cancellation notices get help, we're just going to keep on chipping away at this until the job is done.""

Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee: ""If the president were sincere in his apology and serious about keeping his promise to the American people, he would work with Congress on bipartisan proposals like the Keep Your Health Plan Act. Implementation of this law has been disastrous, leaving worried Americans without the health care plans they had, skyrocketing premiums, and limited access to doctors. (Friday), as we vote on the Keep Your Health Plan Act, we call on the president to work with Congress, not around us.""

Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.: ""I'm encouraged that the president took action to stop the cancellation of insurance policies that Americans were promised they could retain. I was particularly happy to see the notification provision included. ... I remain willing to work with anyone who wants to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and keep the significant promise that it holds for our country. If this were easy, it would have been done 100 years ago. But for the first time in the history of the country under the Affordable Care Act, middle-class and hard-working families, entrepreneurs and small businesses will have access to affordable, quality health care that's there when they need it most.""

Karen Ignagni, president and CEO, America's Health Insurance Plans: ""Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers. Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace. If due to these changes fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer choices for consumers. Additional steps must be taken to stabilize the marketplace."""

Our righteous president has often leveled such charges against America’s corporate leaders, suggesting they skirt the law of the land, and that the playing field is not level for ordinary people. How disappointing then to find a pattern of favoritism and hypocrisy emerging from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

The most recent revelation concerns health insurance exec Sara Horowitz, who recently won a tax-free $340 million federal loan to set up insurance co-ops in three states as part of the ObamaCare program. This, despite the fact that her company, Freelancers Insurance, has earned distinction as the “worst” insurer two years in a row in her home state of New York and that the firm has been pummeled with unusually high consumer complaints.

[pullquote]

Why would such a dismal performance find favor with the feds? Maybe because Ms. Horowitz and President Obama go way back – back to before the latter was a player on the national scene. Back to when she and Obama together launched liberal think tank Demos along with George Soros, jointly joined that outfit’s board, and before Obama’s caretakers managed to get the record of that alliance scrubbed from Demos’ website. Ms. Horowitz and Mr. Obama are long-time cronies.

This is perhaps small beans. But it is part of a “do what I say not what I do” tendency on the part of Mr. Obama that threatens his credibility.

Consider the emergence of Organizing for Action (OFA), a super PAC in all but name that will lobby for the president’s agenda using his former campaign staff and monies donated by rich supporters. Some $50 million is expected to be raised by the outfit, which will make it, according to the New York Times, one of the best funded lobbying groups in the country.

Nearly everything about this group, from its staffing by Obama apparatchiks to its tax-exempt status to its solicitation of funds from folks looking to become ambassadors, flies in the face of the president’s former condemnation of such secretive influence-peddlers.

Because the group is being set up as a tax-exempt “social welfare group” it is, as the Times points out, not bound by rules that govern federal campaign limits or that preclude Obama aides from raising money. The paper concludes that the new organization will “self-regulate.” Just like hedge funds.

What does this mean? It means that the White House can solicit large gifts from private individuals and from corporations to help advance Mr. Obama’s priorities, without having to play by campaign finance rules.

Organizing for Action has already spent $500,000 funding rallies in support of gun control efforts and will doubtless bus supporters to applaud future appearances by Mr. Obama when he speaks out in favor of immigration control or climate change. This kind of thing happens in North Korea and Venezuela, where despots hire cheering audiences; I’m not aware that it has happened in the U.S. before.

OFA claims on its website that it will not engage in partisan politics, yet one of its first moves was to launch a costly national ad campaign targeting GOP lawmakers in support of gun control legislation. It is sailing, shall we say, close to the wind. So is President Obama.

The president has been especially critical of corporate fund-raising. Who can forget his unprecedented attack on the Supreme Court for its decision allowing corporate campaign donations in the Citizens United case? Obama 2.0 has no such qualms. Not only were corporations ""invited” to fund the second inaugural party, they are also being solicited for OFA.

President Obama has switched ponies not only on financial matters. Contrary to his early criticism of Bush 43’s alleged power grabs in the name of anti-terrorism, Obama’s administration has invoked the so-called state secrets privilege to counter lawsuits over warrantless wiretapping – defenses political commentator and former cable news anchor Keith Olbermann called “radical doctrines of executive secrecy which Bush used.”

The president’s use of drones to kill American citizens, and refusal to turn over documents explaining the legal justification for such adventures, also echo Bush policies he once denounced.

While the president appears comfortable with his access to high-tech assassinations, he apparently doubts that successors will use those same powers for the best interests of the nation. It has emerged that in the months leading up to the election, the White House toiled over codifying presidential use of targeted drone killings, just in case he was not reelected.

Campaigner Obama accused President George Bush of exerting excessive authority to wage war; Obama’s refusal to get authorization from Congress to intervene in Libya is thought by many to have been unconstitutional.

In 2007 he also described Bush 43’s use of executive orders as “an unacceptable abuse of power at home.” This from the man who, because he is so inept at negotiating with Republicans and even Democrats in Congress, has spawned an increasing number of executive orders on issues ranging from cyber security to gun control to immigration policy. When Obama promised to “reach across the aisle,” no one expected his reach to extend across both aisles.

Presidents react with frustration to the limits of their power. They also change course once in office. But President Obama’s accelerating abandonment of principle is profound, and keenly disappointing."

Spends More on Disability than Food Stamps, Welfare Combined","In an eye-opening six-month investigation into America’s disability program, Planet Money reporter Chana Joffe-Walt uncovered a “disability industrial complex” fraught with fraud that churns out 14 million checks every month to citizens the government has deemed disabled.

“Since the economy began its slow, slow recovery in late 2009, we’ve been averaging about 150,000 jobs created per month,” said Joffe-Walt in an Public Radio International (PRI) “This American Life” interview. “In that same period every month, almost 250,000 people have been applying for disability.”

Among Joffe-Walt’s findings are the following facts:

The federal government spends more money each year on cash payments for disabled former workers than it does on food stamps and welfare combined; America’s two largest disability programs, including health care for disabled workers, costs taxpayers $260 billion a year

In some parts of the country, such as Hale County, Alabama, one out of every four working-age adults collects a disability check

As of 2011, 33.8% of newly diagnosed disabled workers cited “back pain and other musculoskeletal problems” as their reason for being unable to work. In 1961, the top reason for being disabled was “heart disease, stroke”

Disabled workers do not get counted in the unemployment figures. If they did, the numbers would be far higher

Less than 1% of people who went on disability at the beginning of 2011 have returned to the workforce

The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program–which covers kids and adults–has exploded. SSI is now seven times larger than it was 30 years ago.

The report suggests that the much-touted Welfare to Work policies of the 1990s that appeared to successfully move welfare recipients off the public dole may have been a mirage. States have figured out that shifting people from welfare to disability frees up substantial funds, as states have to pay the costs of welfare, but the federal government picks up the tab for disability.

“That’s a kind of ugly secret of the American labor market,” said MIT economist David Autor. “Part of the reason our unemployment rates have been low, until recently, is that a lot of people who would have trouble finding jobs are on a different program.”

Joffe-Walt says disability has “become a de facto welfare program for people without a lot of education or job skills.” The reporter notes that the disability program “wasn’t supposed to serve this purpose; it’s not a retraining program designed to get people back onto their feet.”

According to Social Security chief actuary Steve Goss, disability insurance program reserves will run out of money in 2016."

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) has made it clear he cannot muster enough votes from his Republican majority to reopen government with a no-strings-attached funding bill, as President Obama wants, or to raise the nation’s debt ceiling to continue paying the nation’s bills beyond Oct. 17.

Rather than buck the tea party flank and reach across the aisle for Democratic votes to pass both measures, House Republicans have decided to change their focus to the debt limit deadline in hopes of reaching a compromise with Democrats on rolling back the size and scope of the federal government.

Democrats are skeptical that Boehner can make a big budget deal after past attempts at a “grand bargain” failed, and have publicly said they would not negotiate any substantive changes until after Republicans agree to reopen federal agencies and raise the government’s debt limit. That all but ensures there will be no quick resolution to the federal government shutdown, which has furloughed 800,000 workers and closed all nonessential government operations, including popular national parks and museums.

In the last major standoff over the debt ceiling, in 2011, the two sides agreed to paper over their inability to agree by creating a new committee to debate budget changes. Whether they can find a similar mechanism that would save face for both sides may determine whether the government can avoid an economically damaging default on its debt.

One point was clear, though, after Boehner gathered a lunchtime meeting Thursday of his kitchen cabinet: The Republicans have sidelined their demand to end the Affordable Care Act in favor of other long-standing GOP priorities, including cuts to Medicare and Social Security.

“The speaker’s trying to get to a broad budget deal,” said Rep. Charles Boustany Jr. (R-La.). “Obamacare’s just part of it. We’re going to try to get what we can, but we understand that’s the president’s legacy. The bigger problem facing the country, in my mind, is the debt, and the fact that we have entitlement programs that are still growing without end in sight. And we need tax reform.”

The debt deadline creates a pressure point that provides the type of governmental crisis that has produced bipartisan agreements in the past. But trust between the parties has deteriorated to such an extent that neither side has great optimism a major deal could be reached before the debt ceiling must be lifted.

Thursday, the Treasury Department warned that a default could trigger a worse financial crisis than in 2008.

“A default would be unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic: credit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, U.S. interest rates could skyrocket, the negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse,” it said in the six-page report on the potential effects on the economy of a debt ceiling impasse.

The report also noted that private economists have estimated a weeklong government shutdown could reduce economic output by about 0.25 of a percentage point, with a longer shutdown having a greater effect.

The federal government has never defaulted on its payments, so the closest historical comparison is the debt limit fight in 2011, the Treasury report said. That was resolved at the last minute but led to a sharp drop in the financial markets, as well as a loss in consumer and business confidence.

“As we saw two years ago, prolonged uncertainty over whether our nation will pay its bills in full and on time hurts our economy,” Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.

Obama told congressional leaders at a 90-minute meeting Wednesday night that he would not negotiate over the shutdown or the debt limit, but would enter into broader budget negotiations after those threats were put to rest.

“Open the government, and we’ll negotiate with you on anything you want to negotiate,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Thursday.

Earlier in the week, Boehner sought to calm some moderate-minded Republicans who appeared ready to end the shutdown by forcing a vote on a government-funding measure that did not repeal any elements of Obama’s healthcare law.

On Thursday, Democrats seized on news reports that the speaker had assured some of the moderates that he would not allow the government to default and would rely on Democratic votes if needed to raise the debt ceiling. Boehner’s spokesman, however, said that while the speaker had conceded he would need Democratic votes, he had not promised to do anything that a majority of his caucus would not support.

Top House Republicans are working on the demands the GOP will make in exchange for raising the debt limit and reopening government, according to those familiar with the internal strategy.

Still smarting from Boehner’s past failed efforts to negotiate a budget deal with the White House, Republicans have shied away from calling any new deal a “grand bargain.”

Rather, they see it as a “big down payment” toward trimming the nation’s deficits, preferring the language of Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the GOP’s leader on budget issues and the former vice presidential nominee.

Following Ryan’s lead, Republicans are expected to revisit the components of past budget battles: cuts to Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs, as well as reforming the tax code, a long-standing interest. They may also seek to gain the Obama administration’s approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline between Canada and the United States, as well as pursue smaller changes to the healthcare law, including repeal of the tax on medical-device makers and an end to the individual patient advisory board.

“To me this is much more about the debt ceiling and a larger budget agreement than it is about Obamacare -- that almost gets in the way of the debate,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).

Cole noted that some Republicans would vote to raise the debt limit, but at a price. “If you’re a Republican member, you can’t raise the debt ceiling and go home without having done something on the deficit,” he said. “I won’t do it just for nothing.”

But Obama has rejected past GOP efforts to cut spending on Medicare and other popular government programs unless Republicans offer new tax revenues as well -- a stalemate that remains unresolved.

For the first time since the New Deal, a majority of Americans are headed toward a retirement in which they will be financially worse off than their parents, jeopardizing a long era of improved living standards for the nation’s elderly, according to a growing consensus of new research.

The Great Recession and the weak recovery darkened the retirement picture for significant numbers of Americans. And the full extent of the damage is only now being grasped by experts and policymakers.

There was already mounting concern for the long-term security of the country’s rapidly graying population. Then the downturn destroyed 40 percent of Americans’ personal wealth, while creating a long period of high unemployment and an environment in which savings accounts pay almost no interest. Although the surging stock market is approaching record highs, most of these gains are flowing to well-off Americans who already are in relatively good shape for retirement.

Liberal and conservative economists worry that the decline in retirement prospects marks a historic shift in a country that previously has fostered generations of improvement in the lives of the elderly. It is likely to have far-reaching implications, as an increasing number of retirees may be forced to double up with younger relatives or turn to social-service programs for support.

“This is the first time that Americans are going to be relatively worse off than their parents or grandparents in old age,” said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research.

Advocates for older Americans are calling on the federal government to bolster Social Security benefits or to create a new layer of retirement help for future retirees. Others want employers and the government to do more to encourage retirement savings and to discourage workers from using the money for non-retirement purposes.

But those calls have been overwhelmed by concern about the nation’s fast-growing long-term debt, which has left many policy­makers focused on ways to trim Social Security and other retirement benefits rather than increase them.

The economic downturn exacerbated long-term factors that were already eroding the financial standing of aging Americans: an inexorable rise in health-care costs, growing debt among older Americans and a shift in responsibility from employers to workers to plan for retirement.

The consequence is that the nation is facing a huge retirement savings deficit — as much as $6.6 trillion, or about $57,000 per household, according to a U.S. Senate report.

Using data on household finances collected by the Federal Reserve, the Center for Retirement Research estimates that 53 percent of American workers 30 and older are on a path that will leave them unprepared for retirement. That marks a sharp deterioration since 2001, when 38 percent of Americans were at risk of declining living standards in old age. In 1989, 30 percent faced that risk.

The center’s findings are similar to those recently uncovered by researchers at the New School, the Heritage Foundation and the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.

“There is a mismatch between retirement needs rising and retirement benefits contracting,” said Alicia H. Munnell, director of Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research.

The precarious situation comes after a long period of change that improved life for the nation’s seniors starting with the enactment of Social Security in 1935.

By the 1960s, retirees also benefitted from universal health insurance through Medicare and Medicaid, sharp increases in Social Security benefits and new protections enacted by the federal government for workers who received traditional pensions, which for decades were a standard employee benefit.

The changes rescued millions of retirees from poverty, while lifting millions of others to prosperous retirements symbolized by vacation cruises, recreational vehicles and second homes.

But now problems for future retirees seem to be closing in from all sides. Half of American workers have no retirement plans through their jobs, leaving people on their own to save for old age.

Meanwhile, four out of five private-sector workers with retirement plans at work have only 401(k)-type defined contribution accounts, rather than traditional pensions that pay retirees a fixed benefit for life. Numerous studies have found that workers with defined-contribution accounts often put aside too little money, make too many withdrawals or employ the wrong investment strategies to save enough for old age. Overall, people ages 55 to 64 have a median retirement account balance of $120,000, Boston College researchers have found, which is enough to fund an annuity paying about $575 a month, far short of what they will need.

Officials at money-management firms that handle 401(k)-type investments argue that the tools are in place for Americans to retire comfortably. The problem, they say, is that employers and workers are not using them correctly.

Robert L. Reynolds, president and chief executive of Putnam Investments, noted that 2006 changes in federal law gave employers the power to automatically enroll workers in retirement accounts. But too few choose to do that and even when they do, companies typically set aside only 3 percent of pay — far less than the estimated 10 percent that experts say workers need to set aside to fund a sound retirement.

“I would be adamant that there is nothing wrong with 401(k)s that can’t be fixed by taking better advantage of the current system,” Reynolds said.

Daniel J. Houston, president of retirement, insurance and financial services at the Principal Financial Group, contended that defined contribution accounts are better tailored than old-fashioned pensions to today’s highly mobile workforce. Workers can take them when they switch jobs. But that control also is a weakness, allowing Americans to tap them for non-retirement purposes.

The retirement savings shortfall is revealing an economic divide separating those who are well prepared for retirement from those who are not. Recent policy changes aimed at bolstering Americans’ retirement prospects have only contributed to the growing inequality.

The government grants at least $80 billion a year in tax breaks to encourage retirement savings in 401(k)-type accounts. But the biggest benefits go to upper-income people who can afford to put aside the most for retirement, allowing them to reap the biggest tax breaks.

Someone making $200,000 a year and contributing 15 percent of pay to a retirement account would receive about a $7,000 subsidy from the federal government in the form of a tax break, whereas workers earning $20,000 making the same 15 percent contribution would get nothing because they don’t earn enough to qualify for a deduction. Someone making $50,000 and making the 15 percent contribution would receive only about a $2,100 tax deduction.

Even many of the diminishing share of workers who are enrolled in traditional pension programs face uncertainty as an increasing number of plans are under­funded, causing employers to freeze benefits.

The hits to retirement income come as many Americans are living longer and health-care costs continue to grow, meaning they need to salt away more money for retirement.

Workers have limited options for closing the gap. More are going to have to work longer. After many decades of decline, average retirement ages have already been creeping up in the past 20 years.

A recent survey by the Conference Board found that nearly two-thirds of Americans ages 45 to 60 say they plan to delay retirement. Two years earlier, 42 percent said they would work longer.

Some lawmakers and other advocates say the best way to cope with the growing gap would be to further expand Social Security and Medicare benefits, or to add another layer of taxpayer-subsidized savings that workers could use only for retirement.

“We need to do more to help American families cope with this looming retirement crisis,” Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said at a hearing late last month. “Hard­working Americans deserve to be able to rest, take a vacation and spend more time with their grandkids when they get older.”

But many policymakers are pushing to rein in the nation’s debt by trimming Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits. Those programs are the primary drivers of the long-term deficit but are also financial mainstays for the vast majority of the nation’s retirees.

Both Medicare and Social Security already are on course to provide reduced benefits for future retirees — reductions that will grow deeper if lawmakers follow through on new proposals to further trim the programs.

With the Social Security retirement age moving to 67 under a federal law passed in 1983, people who leave the workforce earlier — and the vast majority do — will see smaller payouts.

Health-care costs continue to outpace inflation, meaning more out-of-pocket expenses for future seniors. Retirees are also slated to pay more for their health care with Medicare premiums, which are deducted from the Social Security checks of senior citizens, set to rise from 12.2 percent to 14.9 percent by 2030.

James G. Marzano, 60, was on his way to a comfortable retirement when he lost his job at a telecommunications firm in 2002. “People talk about a lost decade; that’s what I’ve been through,” he said.

Marzano, a Tampa resident who is married to a retail worker and has a son who is a high school senior, spent most of the past decade in and out of contract jobs and other posts that paid far less than he was used to. He was forced to dip into his 401(k) account to make ends meet, and even now that he has found a good job, he says, his savings is maybe 60 percent of what it was 10 years ago.

“If everything had stayed status quo from 2002 until 2012, I might be doing what I wanted to do today,” he said. “But, as it stands, I am nowhere near ready to retire.”"

http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/policy-and-the-g-o-p-civil-war/,2013-10-15 00:00:00,['Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Opinion Editorialsandoped Oped Columnists Rossdouthat Index.Html'],Policy and the G.O.P. Civil War,"Late last week, as the G.O.P. descended ever-deeper into civil war, Matt Yglesias and Jonathan Chait both had pieces up marveling at the absence of any actual policy disagreement between the populists driving the shutdown and the establishment/leadership/Senate Republicans trying to find a way out. “Intra-party schisms … are usually rooted in policy,” Chait wrote, but “mainstream Republicans and the tea party have fallen out almost entirely over political tactics.” Yglesias agreed, contrasting the party’s split on foreign policy, where there’s a big substantive gap between the Rand Paul/Justin Amash/Mike Lee libertarian wing and the more hawkish old guard, with the purely tactical split on economic policy:

… Republicans all agree that taxes should be lower, and that it’s especially important to fight for lower tax rates on high earners who productivity and business investments drive the economy forward. Republicans also all agree that this tax cutting agenda requires less spending on domestic programs. And they agree that programs that bolster the incomes of low-income families (as opposed to, say, farm subsidies or war memorials) are especially pernicious because they subsidize indolence.

The entire disagreement is about how and when to push this agenda of more money for the rich and less for the struggling. The question of whether this is the right agenda isn’t really on the table.

I actually almost wish this were true, because it would simplify matters for those of us doomed to have some rooting interest in these kind of intra-Republican battles. But there is an inchoate policy struggle going on here, beneath the surface of the (admittedly much more important) tactical debate and culture war sound and fury, and it relates directly to the question of where the Republican Party should stand in its relationship to big business on the one hand, and the middle class on the other.

Yglesias writes, for instance, that the G.O.P. is united in prioritizing farm subsidies over programs for the poor. But who pushed hardest against the party’s agribusiness handouts, angering even some Tea Party Republicans in the process? Heritage Action, the same group pushing the defund campaign that gave us the shutdown. Or again, Yglesias writes that the G.O.P. is united in its focus on top marginal rate reductions as the be-all and and end-all of conservative economic policy and right-of-center tax reform. But which Republican Senator recently broke with that consensus to propose a a tax reform pitched to middle class families? That would be Mike Lee, the same senator who’s been standing shoulder to shoulder with Ted Cruz these last two weeks.

Or look at the “defund Obamacare” debate itself. If you follow the ins-and-outs of the strategic debate on the right, one of the core issues has been whether to hold firm in demanding at least a one-year delay of the individual mandate, or whether to fall back to something like the medical device tax delay or repeal (which is, as of this writing, being wrapped into the bill that House leadership is trying to push through their body today). The former is the populist position, roughly speaking; the latter is the more moderate/establishment goal. And you will note that the populist goal has a direct connection to middle class economic interests — since for at least some middle-income Americans, the mandate will turn out to be a fine for not purchasing a product that’s suddenly become more expensive — whereas the more moderate ambition mostly sets hearts aflutter in the medical device industry and on K Street. (You can argue that the medical device tax is ultimately passed on to the middle class, of course, but the connection is much more indirect than the mandate.)

Now I’m not arguing that the Lee tax plan, the Heritage Foundation’s opposition to farm subsidies and a focus on the mandate rather than the medical device tax add up to a coherent agenda that’s actually shared by most of the House Intransigents. Many if not most of the members in question fit the Yglesias-Chait description pretty well: They have deeply conventional right-wing views, and they’re just more, well, intransigent about them. (As I noted above, many of the Intransigents broke with Heritage when it held firm on the farm bill, and I doubt many of them have even heard of the Lee tax plan.) And even if there were a coherent populist agenda, it wouldn’t change the fact that the shutdown strategy has proven a comprehensively, transparently hapless means for furthering it.

Yet at the same time, to the extent that policy differences are driving the current intra-G.O.P. fight, the populists tend to have 1) decent ideas and 2) a better sense than their establishment rivals of how to brand the party as something other than just a tool of rich people and business interests. Their strategy is disastrous, but their substance has something to recommend it. Which is part of the reason why it isn’t enough, for the Republicans to escape their current cul-de-sac, for the party leadership to “win” and the populist base to “lose” — let alone for the leadership to somehow jettison the base. Instead, somebody, somehow, has to both integrate and purge — leaving the Tea Party’s baggage by the roadside while continuing to speak to populist impulses and taking up populist ideas, and folding both into a strategic vision that’s more connected to political reality than what we’ve seen these last few weeks.

Somehow."

http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/23/Allen-West-Policies-like-amnesty-driving-up-black-unemployment-lead-to-things-like-Knock-Out-Game,2013-11-23 00:00:00,['Matthew Boyle'],Allen West: 'Dependency Society' Lead to 'Knockout Game',"Col. Allen West, former GOP U.S. Congressman from Florida, said at a Thursday morning panel focused on the devastating economic impacts of amnesty that economic policies that displace black youths from jobs–like President Barack Obama’s immigration policies–have led to fads like the “knockout game.”

The panel, hosted by the nonpartisan pro-jobs group Americans4Work and featuring West and other leaders on immigration policy, focused intensely on how the economy has not gotten better around the country for many groups of Americans, including the black community. They noted how the immigration policies proposed by the president and some in Congress would not help the situation.

West and fellow panelist Professor Jan Ting of Temple University were discussing what they called the “new normal” in America–how Americans are not succeeding independent of the government in record numbers.

“What we don’t want to see happening in the United States of America is this second and third generation of welfare,” West said. “That becomes the new normal. When you look and see your mother and your father or your grandmother or your aunt or uncle, whoever is raising you, that they were born in Section Eight housing, their kids were in Section Eight housing. And therefore, you think there is no place else for me to go but Section Eight housing.”

West said such levels of dependency on the government “affects your level of self-esteem.”

“That affects your ability to, to be a part of an American dream,” he said. “And, I think, the big problem that you see if this, a, situation continues to exacerbate itself, then the safety net is no longer a safety net. The safety net becomes a hammock. And therefore, you have to have an increase of government spending because you’re going to expand and grow this welfare nanny-state.”

Wets noted that the “exorbitant amount of spending” from the federal government on means-tested welfare programs, and what he describes as a diversion of the food stamps program from what it was originally intended to accomplish, leads America “in the wrong direction.”

“And, again, it comes to the fundamental question, are we going to promote an opportunity society or are we going to promote a dependency society?” West asked. “What is the problem if we head down this road? You’re going to have more Detroits. And think about what Detroit used to be. Think about what Detroit used to look like. And guess what? You have this–and this is something that is absolutely driving me crazy, this knockout game.”

West noted that many of those teens involved in the knockout game would have, in his day, had jobs in their towns and would not be engaged in this behavior. But since the economic and education systems created by the left–including immigration policy which allows foreign workers into the country to compete with them for jobs–they have nothing to do but engage in violence.

“Well, guess what? If you have all of these inner-city black teenagers that have nothing to do, their education system is failing them. Well, in the summertime, I knew I could go down to McDonald’s or Burger King, you know, Baskin Robbins, somewhere,” he recalled. “I would go and get my little part-time summer job. They don’t even have those options now. So, what are they doing? They’re going out and they’re beating on people. For what? For fun.”

“This is what happens when the policies are creating more dependence,” West explained. “They’re creating more despair. It’s creating more despondency. And it’s only going to get worse if we don’t turn it around.”

West also addressed amnesty’s devastating impact on the black community’s employment opportunities. When West was asked why the Congressional Black Caucus has been silent on the matter, he responded that “it just goes back to who is your master.”

“I think that they [the Congressional Black Caucus] are more so interested in the interests of the Democratic Party and their agenda rather than the people that they were sent here to Washington, D.C. to serve,” West said. “I’ll go back to a statement that the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Emanuel Cleaver, made, and I asked him about this. But he said that if there was anyone other than President Obama sitting in the White House that we would be marching on the White House when you look at the numbers as far as unemployment in the black community.”

West added that Cleaver said: “We give deference to President Obama for that.”

“So, you know, there is something wrong here,” West said. “And you’re right. When you look at our inner cities, America cannot recover economically unless we do something about our inner cities. If that continues to be the, the weak part of our economy, it will continue to drag the rest of this country down. Because there will be more resources poured into the welfare and nanny state instead of the economic opportunity.”

West said lawmakers and leaders need to be “very careful” with regard to the “trust and confidence that the American people have right now in government.”

“In 1986, let’s remember, we went down the path,” West said. “We had an amnesty program. But there were certain requirements that the federal government were supposed to undertake and they never did. And so, this problem has been exacerbated.”

The failures of Obamacare, West said, have also played into Americans’ mistrust of government, another reason why an amnesty program would not be a good thing.

“Right now, if anyone goes out before the American people and they say ‘comprehensive,’ everyone is running the other way because we have a comprehensive health care plan that we’re dealing with right now,” West said. “So, again, I think, that you need to look at this in multiple ways.”

“I mean, it affects your national security. It affects your economy. It affects your education. It affects your health care. It affects your local criminality,” he stated. “We can get to the point where we have some type of guest worker program. There’s no doubt about that especially in the agricultural industry.”

But before any type of immigration legislation adds to the amount of workers in the country, West said there must be “an economy that is growing”; compared to 1986, he said the economy now is in much worse shape.

“We need to have manufacturing coming back to the United States of America,” West said. “And, Senator [Jeff] Sessions talked about the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] numbers being up. Because on average 0.9 percent GDP growth over each year over the past five or six years. This time in Ronald Reagan’s economy, we were 7.2 percent GDP growth, big difference.”

“So, why are we talking about flooding more people into a workforce where the GDP that is barely, you know, making it, it cannot sustain itself really, a debt to GDP ration which is upside down where we are owing more than we’re, we’re producing, we cannot take more people coming to this workforce,” he explained."

Davidson Previously Was An Assistant City Editor At The Washington Post', 'A Washington', 'Foreign Correspondent With The Wall Street Journal', 'Where He Covered Federal Agencies', 'Political Campaigns.']",Shutdown could boost perception of federal employees,"In a weird way, this stupid government shutdown could improve the perception of federal employees.

Also strange: The Republican-led House, which has often targeted the federal payroll, has unanimously approved a bill that would allow federal workers, too often unjustly criticized as overpaid do-nothings, to get paid for doing nothing.

While nothing about this shutdown makes sense, it is good that the public is getting a better appreciation for the federal workforce. And if Congress is going to pay federal workers, it should let them go back to work.

Shut down the shutdown.

The longer it goes, the more taxpayers will miss the services government and its workers provide. In recent days, a few things have shown how much the government, and therefore its employees, mean to people:

●A Capitol Police officer was injured trying to protect the legislative grounds against a potential attack. An apparently mentally disturbed woman wildly drove her car to Capitol Hill after crashing a barricade at the White House and injuring a uniformed Secret Service officer. Members of the House gave Capitol Police a standing ovation. (As heroic as some officers were, that should not detract from a vigorous and thorough investigation into the fatal shooting by police of the woman while she was in the car with her infant daughter.)

●Rep. Randy Neugebauer’s ridiculous outburst against a National Park Service employee who was merely following orders, which might be overly restrictive, to close monuments. She was defended by another federal employee who confronted the congressman, a Republican from Texas.

●The vote to pay furloughed employees.

“I was surprised that we got a unanimous vote,” said Rep. James P. Moran (D-Va.), a co-sponsor of the legislation. Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), who has a long history of supporting federal employees, also was a co-sponsor.

Wolf “was really instrumental” in securing votes from his caucus, according to Moran. Some Republicans, Moran said, were skeptical about paying people who are not working, but eventually they agreed. “I’d love to think this portends something for the future,” he said. “I’m not sure. I’m not that optimistic.”

But if only for the moment, the news of 407 members of the House — including Neugebauer — agreeing to pay federal employees on furlough is worth savoring. It shows respect for workers who want to work but cannot, through no fault of their own. By the way, the 24 members who did not vote were a bipartisan group: 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats. The bill is expected to pass the Senate.

The vote gives Republicans “some cover for some of the insidious things they’ve passed,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) — evidence that they are “not rabidly anti-government.”

Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said, “There’s a wide recognition that it’s not the individual federal employee’s fault. Each of our offices employs federal workers.”

Republicans think “too many federal workers earn too much money,” he added, “but we’re not spiteful enough to take that out on some worker at the Interior Department.”

If the bill becomes law, it weakens the argument for keeping the government closed.

“Our argument will be, we’re paying these folks, they need to be able to work and earn their pay,” Moran said. “I think it is a compelling argument.”

But Republicans aren’t buying the argument that federal employees should get back to work through passage of a “clean CR.” They have insisted on junking up a temporary government funding measure, called a continuing resolution, with attacks on the Affordable Care Act. Although the have tried and failed many times to derail the health-care law, House Republicans decided to make another attempt by tying implementation of the law to the funding measure, effectively derailing the government.

Speaker John A. Boehner’s (R-Ohio) says that there are not enough votes to pass a clean CR, but various independent tallies, including one by The Washington Post, indicate he is wrong. Allow the vote, and let the tally show who is right. If Boehner is, he has nothing to lose.

The public apparently understands there is no good reason not to vote on a clean bill and allow it to rise or fall on its own merits. A new Washington Post/ABC poll indicates that 70 percent of those surveyed disapprove of the way Republicans are handling the budget situation. Although neither the congressional Democrats nor President Obama fare well in the poll, they look good by comparison, and their numbers are moving, albeit slightly, toward greater public approval.

Meanwhile, as GOP fortunes sink, the shutdown resulting from their budget strategy is boosting compassion for federal employees.

“For your rank-and-file federal worker, there is a lot of sympathy for them getting caught up in the pigsty that is Washington, D.C.,” Chaffetz said. “Everybody is very sympathetic to that.”

Republicans said it was unfair for Mr. Obama to delay enforcement of the employer mandate without granting similar relief to individuals, who may face tax penalties if they go without health insurance next year.

Both requirements were scheduled to take effect in January. But the White House announced this month that it would delay the employer mandate to 2015 because of business concerns about the complexity of the requirements.

On the bill to delay the individual mandate, the vote was 251 to 174. On the bill to delay the employer mandate, the vote was 264 to 161."

Microsoft veterans and farmers, real estate agents and pastry chefs, former journalists and longtime pot growers alike are seeking new challenges — and fortunes — in the production, processing and sale of a drug that's been illegal for generations.

In Colorado, the only other state to legalize marijuana, existing medical marijuana dispensaries can begin selling for recreational use in January. But in Washington, where sales are expected to begin in late spring, the industry is open to nearly anyone — provided they've lived in the state for three months, pass a background check and raise any money from within the state. Washington on Monday began accepting license applications from those eager to jump in. By midafternoon, hundreds had applied.

Click through the portraits, or read through the profiles, of those hoping to make their mark in the new world of legal weed.

THE PIG FARMER

Bruce King says he was a 22-year-old high-school dropout when Microsoft hired him as its 80th employee in 1986. A software engineer, he eventually left and started or acquired two other companies — telephone adult chat and psychic hotlines — but he really wanted to farm.

He found a management team to handle his business and started breeding pigs north of Seattle. After Washington legalized marijuana last fall, he looked at pot as any other crop. The potential margins were ""fabulously attractive,"" he says. He found a farm with a 25,000-square-foot barn for a marijuana operation.

King, 50, doesn't like pot himself, but says, ""If people are going to eat a stupid drug, they should eat my stupid drug."" He likens it to running a psychic hotline when he's never had a reading. ""You don't have to like Brussels sprouts to grow them.""

POT & PATISSERIES

Marla Molly Poiset had swapped her three-decade-old home-furnishing store and interior design business in Colorado for a life of world travel when she learned some devastating news: Her eldest daughter had leukemia.

Story continues

She suspended her travels to help her daughter and her family through the ordeal. She then continued her tour, attending cooking school in Paris. Poiset, 59, graduated last spring, and had an idea: ""Blending my newfound patisserie skills with medical cannabis,"" she says.

So she abandoned Paris for Seattle, where she's been developing recipes for marijuana-infused chocolate truffles for recreational and medical use. Her aim is to create ""a beautiful package"" like French chocolate or pastries for people like her daughter.

They could ""ingest discreetly and enjoy life, rather than everything being in a pill,"" she says.

420-NINER

If legal pot is the Green Rush, Daniel Curylo has some unique credentials: He's been an actual prospector.

He helped put himself through college working for a company that flew him into northern British Columbia and the Yukon with a map, a compass and a heavy backpack. He'd pan for gold and take soil samples. Another source of income in those days? Growing and selling marijuana with a few other political science majors.

A former techie and ex-house flipper, Curylo, 41, says his background in ""business development and taking risks"" is perfect for the legal pot world.

He has invested $400,000 so far. His goal? A cannabis business park northwest of Olympia that would feature his growing operation, Cascade Crops, as well as retail stores run by his mother, father and aunt.

'THE POSTER CHILD FOR ANTI-CANNABIS'

Angel Swanson was raised on the South Side of Chicago by a mother who warned: ""If you see drugs, run.""

Decades later, the businesswoman and real estate agent found herself in Washington state with a husband, seven children and a strong bias against illegal drugs — ""the poster child for anti-cannabis,"" she says.

That is, until one of her daughters, who had serious digestive issues and had never weighed more than 100 pounds, came home from college one day and ate a full plate of food. The girl had tried pot-laced cookies, which stimulated her appetite. Swanson lost it.

""Do you have any idea the sacrifices that have been made for you to go to college?"" she remembers saying.

Swanson, 52, did some research and couldn't find a reason for her daughter not to use weed. She and her husband opened a medical marijuana dispensary, The Cannabis Emporium, near Tacoma. They now want to sell recreational pot, but hope to continue to serve patients — a challenge, since stores will be barred from trumpeting pot's therapeutic benefits.

FROM MBA TO THC

Todd Spaits and Bilye (sounds like ""Billy"") Miller are more gym-and-yoga than smoke-and-cough. The couple doesn't use pot — ""I much prefer a glass of scotch,"" Spaits says — but they say they know a good business opportunity when they see one.

The pair previously worked in online marketing in San Diego, and Spaits has a master's in business administration. Their most recent startup is skyfu.com, which helps restaurants monitor what people are saying about them on social media.

Spaits, 39, also helps judge business plan competitions and believes his skills are perfectly honed to run a successful pot store.

He and Miller, 38, who has also worked as a bartender, are excited about Washington's grand experiment. They sought advice from friends who operate medical dispensaries in California to help draw up a revenue model. They're seeking a retail license in Kirkland, east of Seattle.

THE PATH FROM ADDICTION

It started with small doses that eased the aches of restaurant work. But over time, Yevgeniy ""Eugene"" Frid found himself addicted to prescription painkillers. ""It completely envelops your whole life.""

He tried to quit many times, and when he finally did, he says, cannabis played a huge role — displacing the opiates with a substance much gentler on the body.

Frid, 28, quit his job doing business management and marketing for a video game company when a friend asked him to help start a medical marijuana dispensary. A Greener Today opened in Seattle in 2012 and now serves about 4,000 people.

Frid says his most gratifying work is helping patients get off opiates the way he did, so he has mixed feelings about applying for a recreational retail license. The future of unregulated medical marijuana in Washington is dim — many state officials see it as a threat to the heavily taxed recreational system. Some medical dispensary operators believe they have little choice but to convert to the recreational market.

""We don't know what's happening,"" Frid says.

THE SECURITY GUARD

For a guy with a uniform and a gun, Steve Smith was unusually welcome at medical marijuana dispensaries. Of course, he was a security guard, not a federal drug agent.

Smith, 29, had a background in food marketing. His father worked for a large grocery cooperative in California. He earned a degree in agriculture business management and started marketing organic and natural products for a food broker. He liked thinking he was helping people eat better.

A friend who was working in security suggested Smith do the same. Looking to keep busy and make some extra money, he took his training and became a certified security guard. The company that hired him happened to assign him to a couple of medical marijuana dispensaries.

""You can only work as a guard for so long before you want to open your own shop,"" he says. He wants to apply to open two retail marijuana shops near Tacoma.

THE SECRET SODA

Cecilia Sivertson worked for eight years as a paralegal in the prosecutor's office for Washington's most populous county. She helped make sure people paid child support and tracked down deadbeat dads. It was a rewarding, stressful and sometimes depressing job.

After her husband died in a car accident in 2001, she decided she needed a more upbeat line of work and joined a labeling business.

Sivertson, 55, has epilepsy and arthritis in her hands. About two years ago, she says, she noticed improvement in both when she started using marijuana. Last spring, she began making products infused with cannabis oil under her ""Nana's Secret"" line. Her specialty is pot-infused soda — with the soda concentrate produced by a client of the labeling business.

The Alabama native says she's applying to become a licensed marijuana processor so her sodas and other items can be sold in retail pot stores.

CANNABIS: A FORCE FOR GOOD

Paul Schrag has a simple philosophy: He hopes to use his skills to do the most good in the world.

For a while, that meant working in journalism, enticed by its power to shape public discourse. Before being laid off in 2009, he worked as a reporter for the Business Examiner, a biweekly publication in Tacoma.

Nowadays, it means working in the pot industry.

The 40-year-old says he's been growing marijuana since 1999 and uses it to treat lifelong neck pain. He began working at a medical marijuana collective, where part of his job entails coming up with a marketing and public education plan to help erase any stigma associated with cannabis use.

He believes the medical and social benefits of the plant are only just starting to be understood. He plans to work as a grower's vice president of marketing, research and development, and believes his knowledge of pot and business will help.

""I'm one of those rare cats that get both,"" he says.

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy stuck with House leadership’s insistence that its proposal can indeed pass in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but acknowledged having an alternative plan.

“You assume they won’t vote for it. Let’s have that debate,” the California Republican told “Fox News Sunday.” But “we have other options for the Senate to look at.”

The government would technically run out of money Monday night should Congress fail to pass a temporary spending bill, resulting in a partial government shutdown that would begin with hundreds of thousands of government workers likely being sent home from work without pay.

The House proposal passed early Sunday morning includes two amendments to a spending bill passed Friday by the Senate. One delays ObamaCare for a year and the other repeals the law’s medical device tax. The lower chamber also passed a bill to pay the military on time should a government shutdown occur.

Just hours after House Republicans announced their plan Saturday afternoon, the White House vowed President Obama would veto it. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made clear it was unacceptable.

“To be absolutely clear, the Senate will reject both the one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of the medical device tax,"" Reid said. ""After weeks of futile political games from Republicans, we are still at square one.""

Earlier this month, the Senate rejected a House spending bill to defund ObamaCare, despite a filibuster-style effort by Tea Party-backed, Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.

McCarthy declined to tell Fox News whether one of the proposals would be passing a so-called “clean” spending bill, or continuing resolution, which would keep open the government for a few days until Congress agrees on a longer-term plan. But he insisted the House will not be responsible for a shutdown and that it will offer a proposal with Democratic support.

“We are not shutting the government down,” he said. “While the president was out playing golf [Saturday], we were here until 1 a.m. We will pass a bill that reflects this House. … I think they’ll be additions that Democrats can support.”

Right now, the House bill covers government spending through Dec. 15, while the Senate bill goes through Nov. 15."

President Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act

The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Dec. 3-8 among 2,001 adults, finds majorities say it is more important to maintain spending on Social Security and Medicare and programs to help the poor than to take steps to reduce the budget deficit. Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say it is more important to maintain current Social Security and Medicare benefits than to reduce the deficit, while 59% prioritize keeping current levels of spending for programs that help the poor and needy over deficit reduction.

There is greater public support for cutting military spending in order to achieve deficit reduction. About half of Americans (51%) say reducing the deficit is more important than keeping military spending at current levels, while 40% say deficit reduction is more important.

Bad news for the Third Way, Fix the Debt, Kick the Can and all the other Wall Street and Pete Peterson-funded ""think tanks"" out there: they still haven't convinced the American public that the deficit is more important than, well, the American public and its well-being. The latest evidence comes from Pew Furthermore, if we really do need to cut the deficit, the public has strong ideas about how to do just that:There are partisan divides when it comes to helping the needy: 84 percent of Democrats prioritize it, but 55 percent of Republicans say deficit reduction is more important than people being able to, you know, eat, have clothing, shelter. I know, you're shocked.

But when it comes to Social Security and Medicare, everyone agrees: ""majorities of Democrats (79%), independents (66%) and Republicans (62%) say it is more important to continue current spending levels for Social Security and Medicare than to take steps to reduce the budget deficit."" Yeesh, Third Way can't even convince Republicans. They've also failed in fomenting generational warfare: ""On entitlements, the youngest Americans (ages 18-29) prioritize maintaining Social Security and Medicare benefits over deficit reduction by a 61%-30%.""

What all of these D.C.- and Wall Street-centric organizations fail to realize, over and over and over again, is that the vast majority of the American people is invested in this country and in the well-being of their fellows. We're far more generous and expansive than the cynical deficit-hawks give us credit for. Smarter, too."

Now their goal is to balance the federal budget in 10 years.

Leading the charge will be Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, who is drafting the GOP's proposed 2014 budget.

Ryan's budget last year was savaged by Democrats for its spending cuts, among other things. But even that budget, which would have slashed deficits significantly, would not have resulted in a balanced budget until close to 2040.

So how realistic is it now for Republicans to balance the budget within 10 years?

""Technically it's plausible. ... But politically it may be too much,"" said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

One reason it may be plausible is that the House will be putting out what's called a budget resolution, which sets broad targets for spending and revenue. It's the starting point in a months-long process and doesn't require lawmakers to offer all details on how to meet those targets.

In addition, a budget resolution is based on a set of policy and economic assumptions -- and small changes to things like economic growth forecasts can make a big difference to the bottom line, Penner said.

Another reason: Ironically, given Republicans' opposition to raising taxes, Ryan's job will be made somewhat easier this year by the more than $600 billion in new revenue that will be raised thanks to the fiscal cliff deal that Congress passed over New Year's.

For instance, Ryan's budget last year would have racked up a roughly $250 billion deficit in 2022. The new revenue would reduce that to about $130 billion, according to estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

A balanced budget is virtually guaranteed to be a non-starter with Democrats. Their goal is to stabilize the debt by the end of the decade. That is, reduce annual deficits enough so that total public debt remains constant as a share of the economy.

Related: House passes bill to defuse debt ceiling

Democrats are also likely to reject the House Republican budget proposal because it's likely to include more of the controversial proposals they rejected from Ryan's budget last year.

Ryan proposed lower spending levels than those set by the 2011 Budget Control Act and called for Medicare to include a premium support system starting in 2023. He also wanted to convert funding for Medicaid, food stamps and other low-income programs to block grants.

So for House Republicans to reach a balanced budget within 10 years -- and to do so only through spending cuts, since they've ruled out raising any more tax revenue -- they would have to do much more, and sooner.

It's a fair bet that health care entitlement changes will be central to the effort.

""Like most in the private sector, we want to transition from a defined benefit scenario to a defined contribution scenario. But you need to affect some real reforms in health care delivery and compensation and payment,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told CNN's Ali Velshi this week.

One way to get to a balanced budget faster might be to enact Ryan's Medicare premium-support model in 2018, five years earlier than in his previous budget, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Or reduce Medicare provider payments. Or raise current retirees' Medicare cost-sharing.

Or all of the above.

Independent deficit hawks aren't pushing for a balanced budget within a decade because it would require drastic changes that could hurt the economy and couldn't fully address long-term drivers of debt. At the same time, they say Democrats' goal of stabilizing the debt is only a first step. Health care costs must be brought down and entitlement programs reformed or the debt would soon start growing again.

It may be several weeks before Ryan unveils his budget. In the meantime, all eyes will be on the Congressional Budget Office, which will release its latest budget and economic outlook for the next decade on Feb. 4. That will give a much clearer sense of the magnitude of changes needed to balance the budget anytime soon."

Uruguays parliament is to vote Tuesday a project that would make the country the first to legalize marijuana, an experiment that seeks to confront drug trafficking. The initiative launched by 78-year-old Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, a former revolutionary leader, would enable the production, distribution and sale of cannabis, self-cultivation and consumer clubs, all under state control. AFP PHOTO/ Pablo PORCIUNCULA (Photo credit should read PABLO PORCIUNCULA/AFP/Getty Images)

A California initiative that would legalize, regulate and tax recreational marijuana may be coming soon to the state ballot after a positive review by the state attorney general. But the real news is how much money legalization could bring to the cash-strapped state government.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris last week released a summary of the Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act, which backers are pushing for a spot in November's election.

Though not an endorsement, Harris' generally positive title and summary of the initiative explained that it would legalize under state law marijuana use, growth, cultivation, possession, transportation, storage and sale. It also would create a regulatory commission, apply sales taxes, allocate revenue and prohibit discrimination against marijuana users and businesses.

The summary says a legislative analyst estimated the initiative would save the state ""hundreds of millions of dollars.""

Merry Christmas, indeed!

Here's what the fiscal analysis had to say:

Reduced costs in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually to state and local governments related to enforcing certain marijuana-related offenses, handling the related criminal cases in the court system, and incarcerating and supervising certain marijuana offenders. Potential net additional tax revenues in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually related to the production and sale of marijuana, a portion of which is required to be spent on education, health care, public safety, drug abuse education and treatment, and the regulation of commercial marijuana activities.

As LA Weekly noted, there was a slight speed bump in the language of the initiative. It originally read that the law ""could"" protect people under age 21 from using marijuana, instead of ""shall"" protect them. An amended version is awaiting a title and summary from the attorney general, expected to be released on Jan. 31.

""We're expecting a title and summary nearly identical to the one that was just released, if not even more supportive,"" Dave Hodges, one of initiative's primary backers, told The Huffington Post. ""There isn't any change that would affect the title and summary that was released.""

If Hodges is correct, the new title and summary would pave the way for advocates to gather signatures supporting adding the initiative to the November ballot.

The move could come at a good time for California, which has struggled with crippling budget deficits over the past decade. Though the state has seen notable financial success under Gov. Jerry Brown's Proposition 30, which temporarily raises taxes, the pot initiative could add much-needed cushioning when the proposition expires in 2018."

Owner Tom Hackett, 59, right, and butcher Randy Bryson wind down Hackett’s Meat Market in Rome, Ga., shortly before the store closes for good. Hackett, who ran the business for five years, says the store was hampered by the weak local economy, a new chain grocery store down the street and a bank that said it couldn’t lend to him anymore. He also blames President Obama. David Walter Banks

Tom Hackett’s life in the meat business was nearly gone by 4 p.m. on Thursday. What remained behind yards and yards of polished glass were a few scattered remnants of his final inventory — a couple of flank steaks, some shrimp, a lonely half a pound of bologna.

Hackett stood behind the case and lamented that in a few hours he would be closing the store he has run for five years. The weak local economy killed it, he said, and so did the new chain grocery store down the street and the bank that said it couldn’t lend to him anymore. But the biggest culprit, he said, was a man in Washington whose name Hackett could not bring himself to speak.

“I’m going to go hide for two years,” he said, until “he” — President Obama — is on his way out. “It’s sad. People are hurting. There’s no reason for it to be happening, other than what he’s doing.”

If you want to understand the congressional Republicans who have forced confrontations with Obama on the “fiscal cliff,” the government shutdown and the debt ceiling — and whether those lawmakers might feel encouraged to force more confrontations in the future — you need to understand the economic struggles of the Republicans’ home districts.

People in those districts are poorer and more likely to be unemployed than in the nation at large. They have focused their anger about their economic circumstances on Obama, and they want someone, anyone, to make him improve things for them. This is why Hackett praises his congressman, Tom Graves, for voting against the plan to end the budget impasse with Obama that produced the shutdown. “I think he’s great,” he said of Graves. “Somebody’s got to stand up to him.”

View Graphic On average, the economy in the districts hard-line Republicans represent is worse than it is in the nation at large.

Forty-five House Republicans have most consistently pushed their caucus to brinkmanship over the past several years, according to a Washington Post analysis of voting patterns.

On average, the economy in the districts those Republicans represent is significantly worse than it is in the nation at large.

The median income in those districts last year was 7 percent lower than the national median, according to the Census Bureau. The unemployment rate averaged 10 percent. That was almost two percentage points higher than the national rate, and two percentage points higher than the overall rate in the states that contain each district.

The epicenter of that economic distress lies in the Deep South. Four of the congressional districts are in North Georgia. A dozen others are close by in Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, and North and South Carolina. Nearly all of them ended 2012 with jobless rates in the double digits.

The Rome metro area has fewer jobs today than it did when the recession ended in 2009. The unemployment rate was 10 percent last year, and it has fallen this year, to 8.8 percent in August, only because so many people have given up looking for work.

The city of 36,000 sits a little more than an hour northwest of Atlanta, near the Alabama and Tennessee borders. It doesn’t look depressed. Construction crews are building big-box stores on the highway into town, and on a recent night, several restaurants in the historic downtown were nearly full for dinner.

But economic statistics show that the metro area hasn’t recouped any of the more than 3,000 jobs it lost during the recession, on net. In interviews across town, workers, executives and small-business owners blame that struggle largely on Obama. Many of them say the Dodd-Frank financial regulations put a chill on local bank lending — and they say it was the president who pushed for the legislation.

And it would be difficult to overstate the outrage expressed about the president’s signature health-care law, the Affordable Care Act.

“There is a lot of frustration over the way the government’s acting” when it comes to the economy, said Roger F. Smith, the chief executive of River City Bank in Rome, one of several people in town who contrasted Obama’s performance in office with the economic success they experienced under President Bill Clinton. “There’s a lack of confidence in the leadership. That starts with the president. It certainly hampers the ability to recover.”

Hackett, 58, called Obama’s entire agenda anti-business: “It’s like, ‘What can we do to kill the economy?’ ” It was his final day of selling to customers at the specialty meat shop he opened in 2008 as a hobby, catering to grilling enthusiasts like himself who want higher-end steaks than the big grocery stores sell.

When the shop opened, Hackett was still primarily a real estate developer, siting and building homes in subdivisions around Rome and Floyd County. He lost that business in the housing crash, and his retirement nest egg with it, and was left with his store to support him. He worked there with his wife, Tippy, and a few employees, including an in-house butcher. Sales were okay at first but began trickling off over the past two years as consumers tightened up in the increasingly weak recovery.

Then, Hackett said, his bank pulled back on lending, citing new federal regulations. Over the summer, he and Tippy dropped their health-care coverage after their insurer raised rates, something the Hacketts blame on the federal health-care law. The opening of a Publix grocery store peeled off more precious customers, and last week, the Hacketts sent an e-mail to customers saying they were shutting down. They made the front page of the Rome News-Tribune.

On their final afternoon, the Hacketts marked all the meat in the case down by $2 a pound. They consoled loyal customers, one of whom cried at the news. They said they aren’t sure what they’ll do for money, but they are quitting the entre­pre­neur­ship game, at least until he-who-shall-not-be-named leaves office.

In a back room, their butcher, soon to be laid off, rubbed water over his chopping block, slowly and carefully, wiping the blood away one last time.

Around town, there is plenty of worry that things are about to get worse because of Washington. On Thursday evening, a dozen small-business owners gathered under the pink flourescent lights of a college auditorium to brace themselves for the effects the health-care law could have on their firms.

A pair of lawyers, one from Atlanta and one from Chattanooga, Tenn., walked attendees through an array of PowerPoint slides centered on the legislation’s requirements — and building to what the lawyers called the “pay or play” question: Should owners of firms large enough to fall under the law’s mandates to provide health insurance to their workers comply with it, or should they refuse and pay fines?

The lawyers raised several options, mostly about how to avoid the mandates of the law: cutting back all workers to part time, for instance, or hiring mostly independent contractors. They also noted that such steps could carry legal problems. “Maybe you want to offer coverage,” one of them allowed. “That’s okay.” But then he suggested ways to do it that would still shield the business from federal requirements about what type of coverage to offer.

The next morning, one un­insured produce worker sorted apples into boxes for one of the last times. Donald Rizer, 58, wore a plaid shirt, blue jeans and gloves, and complained of the aching shoulder that he said keeps him from working more than 20 hours a week.

Soon he’ll be out of work. Rizer’s employer, Todd Beam, is shutting down the wholesale produce business his father started 35 years ago. Beam blamed the move on a freeze on bank lending — which he said his bank attributed to the new financial regulations — and on a weak economy, for which he blamed Obama. (There’s also the matter of a crucial school lunch supply contract, which Beam lost to a lower-bidding firm from Atlanta). He was set to lay off three workers and go back to his previous job, driving a commercial truck.

Rizer did not have a new job lined up. He had come down to Rome after leaving a carpet factory several years ago. He needs shoulder surgery but can’t afford insurance. And because of a quirk in the health-care law, and the fact that Georgia declined to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income people like him, Rizer can’t qualify for a subsidy to buy coverage on his own.

When he visited the federal health insurance exchange Web site, he found the cheapest policy available to him cost $200 a month — one quarter of his current salary. “Obama,” he said, “he thinks that he’s helping things, but he ain’t.”

He fished out a bruised green apple and tossed it aside. Only a few boxes were left."

http://news.yahoo.com/gop-shutdown-debt-plan-no-agreement-yet-165932830--politics.html,,[],"New GOP shutdown/debt plan, but no agreement yet","WASHINGTON (AP) — Efforts accelerated in Congress on Friday to keep the U.S. Treasury from defaulting as early as next week and to end the partial government shutdown that stretched through an 11th day. At the White House and Capitol, President Barack Obama and top aides consulted repeatedly with both House and Senate Republicans.

""Let's put this hysterical talk of default behind us and instead start talking about finding solutions,"" said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

There was no shortage of suggestions. Yet there also was no evidence of agreement to end crises that have caused financial markets to shudder and interest rates to rise, while closing some federal offices and sending 350,000 workers home on furlough, without pay.

Senate and House Republicans each offered to reopen the government and raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit — but only as part of broader approaches that envision deficit savings, changes to the health care law known as Obamacare and an easing of across-the-board spending cuts that the White House and Congress both dislike. The details and timing differed.

""We're waiting to hear"" from administration officials, said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.

While the impact of the shutdown varies widely, lawmakers seemed to be taking care of their own needs.

The members-only House gym remained in operation, and enough Senate staff was at work to operate the aging underground tram that ferries senators and others from the Russell Office Building to the Capitol a short distance away.

Obama met at the White House for more than an hour with Senate Republicans, the last in a series of four presidential sit-downs with the rank and file of each house and each party.

He has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he is willing to negotiate with Republicans on budget, health care or other issues, but only after the government is reopened and the threat of default eliminated.

The White House seemed to wobble on that point on Thursday, until Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., emphatically reinforced that it was his view, too.

Story continues

Republicans have just as insistently demanded that Obama negotiate with them in exchange for passage of legislation that both sides agree is essential.

That left the White House and congressional leaders looking for a way to negotiate their way out of an impasse without appearing to negotiate — with the health of the nation's economy dependent on their political dexterity. The administration says the government will bump up against its borrowing limit next Thursday, raising the specter of an unprecedented default.

At Obama's meeting with Senate Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine laid out a proposal to raise the debt limit until the end of January, reopen the government and take a slice out of the health care law.

Under a proposal she and other GOP senators have been developing, a medical device tax that helps finance the health care law would be repealed, and millions of individuals eligible for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the program would be subject to stronger income verification.

At the same time, federal agencies that have been affected by across-the-board cuts would gain greater flexibility in the use of their remaining funds.

Any other items could be negotiated later.

Back at the Capitol, Collins said Obama said the proposal ""was constructive, but I don't want to give the impression that he endorsed it.""

For their part, House Republicans previewed a different approach in a late-night meeting Thursday with White House officials.

It, too, would raise the debt limit and avoid a default, as part of a framework that could include easing the across-the-board cuts in exchange for reductions that Obama has supported in the past in benefit programs. That plan, too, seeks changes in Obamacare.

White House officials declined to comment on that proposal, although administration aides were checking with key Democrats in Congress to gauge their reaction.

The White House and Republicans have negotiated almost $4 trillion in deficit savings in the past three years. But little of that has come out of benefit programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Republican proposals seemed an attempt to open up that part of the budget to scrutiny.

Obama has proposed raising the cost of Medicare for better-off seniors, a $50 billion item over a decade. He has also backed higher fees under TRICARE, which provides health care for nearly 10 million active-duty and retired military personnel, retirees, reservists and their families, as well as increases in the cost of retirement benefits for federal workers.

After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, the 2013 federal budget shortfall is expected to register below $700 billion, but Republicans say more cuts are essential. At the same time, the nation's debt is rising inexorably — the reason for the effort to raise borrowing limit to cover it. The debt was $10.6 trillion when Obama took office during the worst recession in decades, and has grown by $6.1 trillion in the years since.

The House Republicans' plan was outlined in the Thursday night White House meeting that included senior aides to Obama as well as to House Speaker John Boehner and Cantor, several hours after Obama met with top Republicans.

The discussions unfolded as the House voted 248-176 to resume funding for nuclear arms research and security despite the broader shutdown. It was the latest GOP bill aimed at reviving popular programs — and the latest to face swift demise in the Senate, where Reid has rejected nearly all bills that fall short of fully reopening the government.

He was lauded by some as fighting for jobs and opportunity, and even for launching a “war on inequality” equivalent to President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1960s War on Poverty. He was assailed by others for showing his true colors as a man of big government and wealth redistribution.

Yet the initiatives Obama proposed are striking not for their sweep but for their limited scope. That reflects both pragmatism and realism: Not only is the age of big government really over, so is the age of government as the transformative force in American society. And that is all for the best.

Wait a minute, you might reasonably object: What about healthcare? What about the proposals for minimum -wage increases, for expanded preschool, for innovation centers, for $50 billion in spending on roads and infrastructure? Surely those are big government and aim, effectively or not, for transformation?

Healthcare and the changes under the Affordable Care Act are significant, and for now they have expanded the scope and cost of government However, those costs appear to be growing more slowly than expected, at least according to the Congressional Budget Office. While healthcare costs are increasingly untenable, the issue is one of healthcare costs for society as a whole. Recent legislation means government bears more of them, but someone will bear them no matter what.

So while healthcare is billed as an expansion of government, it is more a continuing issue of cost and delivery of something that has to be paid for by someone and at some cost.

On almost every other front, government is receding ‑ not just from the financial crisis high tide of 2008-2009 but from decades before. Each of Obama’s proposals hones and potentially reduces current spending, whether on education or on infrastructure. That $50 billion for roads appears large. In mid-2012, though, Congress authorized $120 billion in highway expenses through 2014, and much of what Obama proposes could be encompassed by focusing current spending.

Even if there is new spending there, it is a pittance compared to the interstate highway bills of the 1950s or the space program of the 1960s, let alone the many programs that encompassed the War on Poverty and led to a vast expansion of federal programs in healthcare, housing and education.

Take the minimum wage, the issue that received perhaps the most attention among the president’s proposals, save gun control. But increasing the minimum wage isn’t a government program. It’s a bill that potentially mandates higher costs for some employers. Whether you love it or hate it, it is not an expansion of government ‑ and certainly not of government spending.

All these proposals, in fact, are small-bore for the post-New Deal era. They are small-bore compared to the massive 2009 stimulus bill of almost $800 billion. They are small-bore because there is no political ill for them to be larger-bore, and because it is unclear just how much government can use the bazooka of big spending to effect significant changes in society.

Take jobs. Aside from hiring the unemployed in a New Deal-style program, the government can do only so much to create jobs and alter the trajectory of unemployment. While hiring those unemployed might not cost much more than the tens of billions spent annually on unemployment benefits, there would still need to be jobs once those programs ran their course.

Yes, government can create incentives for businesses. But those incentives are almost always state and local tax incentives to lure companies to build factories. That is good for temporary boosts to construction. As we know, with robotics and just-in-time inventories, factories do not generate the number of jobs they once did.

What does appear to create jobs are people and their needs and wants. There is some evidence that self-employment has been on an upsurge, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that self-employment as it measures the category has been largely static over the past decades .

Still, somewhere between 10 percent and 15 percent of the labor force is self-employed ‑ whether by intent (starting a small business) or involuntarily (couldn’t find any other work). The world of social media may be tiny in the greater scheme of things, but social media appears to be ever more central in the way companies find employees (the LinkedIn phenomenon) and how consumers find products.

In fact, the suite of tools encompassed by information technologies on the Web may be adding more to income and affluence than we think or than official statistics show. According to Eric Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “free goods” of the Internet, like Google[r1] , could be adding as much as $300 billion to our gross domestic product each year. That has nothing to do with government and is clearly boosting quality of life.

One day, we will look back on this era as a period of transition. The problem is that we don’t know what we are shifting to, or whether it is something we will perceive as better or worse.

Government will be one aspect of that transition. But it would be a mistake to see it as the axis of that transition. The current Washington debates ‑ about whether there will be a “sequester” or not, a drastic cut in spending or only a small one ‑ demonstrate that government is shrinking and the horizons of its ambitions narrowing. Given the limitations of what government can and cannot do, that is hardly something to mourn or decry.

Protecting the commons is something government must do and is. Singlehandedly managing the transition to the next economy is something is cannot do ‑ and should not.

Although he didn’t mention the holiday, his remarks suggested that we give thanks to him, for what he called “some good things happening in our economy”—all of which turn out to be as deceptive as his claims about ObamaCare.

The president said, “Our businesses have created 7.8 million new jobs in the past 44 months.” However, as economic commentator Kenn Jacobine points out, that averages to 177,000 jobs per month over 44 months, whereas during the same time period, the working age population has grown by an average of 213,000 workers per month. Thus, under Mr. Obama, his jobs “recovery” is actually a jobs recession.

[pullquote]

Furthermore, as McClatchy Tribune Services reports, “according to Labor Department statistics, the number of people working part time in the U.S. grew four-and-a-half times as fast as the number of full-time workers. And the share of all workers who mainly hold part-time jobs is at levels not seen since the early 1980s.” This underemployment exposes as fantasy the president’s boast that “we have fought our way back…to rebuild on a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth.”

Actually, economic growth (in gross domestic product) under President Obama has averaged 2.3% over the past four years. Yet to produce anywhere near the job growth the president aspires to, GDP growth would have to roughly double—and to achieve that would require a miracle: that the president would change Obamanomics to the tax-cutting and free market policies of Reaganomics. As economist Peter Morici writes, “Four years into the Reagan recovery, after a deeper recession than the one Obama inherited, GDP was advancing at a 4.9 percent annual pace, and jobs creation was quite robust.”

In his radio address, the president boasted that, “We decided to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. And today, we generate more renewable energy than ever, more natural gas than anybody, and for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more oil than we buy from other countries.”

That’s no thanks to President Obama. According to Investor’s Business Daily, “While production is up under Obama, this has nothing to do with his policies, but is the result of permits and private industry efforts that began long before Obama occupied the White House.” IBD adds, “Obama has chosen almost always to limit production. He canceled leases on federal lands in Utah, suspended them in Montana, delayed them in Colorado and Utah, and canceled lease sales off the Virginia coast. His administration also has been slow-walking permits in the Gulf of Mexico, approving far fewer while stretching out review times.”

In his radio address, Mr. Obama admits about ObamaCare that, “…the rollout of the marketplace where you can buy affordable plans has been rough,” but he offers as compensation that, “health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.”

Not true, according to FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which writes, “Obama greatly exaggerated when he credited the health care law for bending the cost curve on health care spending. Experts say the down economy is the overwhelming reason that national health care spending has been growing at historically slow rates in recent years.”

Ignoring his role (especially the role of ObamaCare) in creating that “down economy,” in his radio address the president patted himself on the back when he said, “…since I took office, we’ve cut our deficits by more than half.”

But in a fact check, the Associated Press writes, “An estimated $78 billion of that deficit reduction comes from automatic across-the-board spending cuts, called sequestration, that began taking effect in March—over Obama's protests.” The AP adds, “While annual deficits are declining, the national debt—the accumulation of deficits going back to the days of George Washington—is still rising. It stood at $10.6 trillion the day Obama took office. It's now $16.7 trillion, according to the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Public Debt.” That is, the AP writes, “…the largest increase to date under any president.”

In his radio address, President Obama lamented, “Imagine how much farther along we could be if both parties were working together.”

The president’s hand wringing is underhanded. That’s because he has disdainfully rejected Republican ideas and legislative proposals regarding almost every one of his major policy initiatives, including reforms in health care, financial regulation, taxes, spending, immigration, and energy use.

Here’s how President Obama concluded his radio address: “…as long as I’m President, I’ll keep doing everything I can to create jobs, grow the economy, and make sure that everyone who works hard has a chance to get ahead.”

All this is reminiscent of the way President Clinton described a string of Mr. Obama’s fabrications during the 2008 Democratic primaries. President Clinton said, “Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I’ve ever seen.”"

As the population gets older, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are eating up more and more of the federal budget, squeezing the ability of the government to pay for other programs. Today, the three massive benefit programs account for 44 percent of federal spending. Left unchanged, they will account for more than 60 percent in 25 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Unless Congress acts, the trust fund that supports Social Security is projected to run out of money in 2033. At that point, the retirement and disability program would collect only enough in payroll taxes to pay about 75 percent of benefits.

Medicare's hospital insurance fund is in worse shape. It is projected to run out of money in 2024. At that point, it would only be able to pay 87 percent of costs, according to projections by the trustees who oversee Medicare and Social Security.

___

The campaign promise:

Obama rarely mentioned Social Security during his 2012 re-election campaign. Four years earlier, he was more forthcoming.

In a 2008 speech to AARP: ""John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let me be clear: I will not do either.""

On Medicare, Obama told the Democratic convention on Sept. 6, 2012: ""Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more.""

___

The prospects:

Obama has already offered to break part of his 2008 pledge on Social Security. Twice in negotiations with GOP leaders, he agreed to adopt a new measure of inflation that would result in smaller cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, for Social Security recipients. Both deals fell apart. But now Obama has put forward the idea in his own proposed federal budget. If adopted, it would gradually trim benefit increases in Social Security, Medicare and other programs while raising taxes.

Story continues

His proposed changes, once phased in, would mean a cut in Social Security benefits of nearly $1,000 a year for an average 85-year-old, $560 for a 75-year-old and $136 for a 65-year-old.

Obama and Republican leaders in Congress have held off-and-on talks about possible changes to entitlement programs since 2011, as part of their efforts to reduce government borrowing. But a deal remains elusive. Republicans insist any agreement must include deep spending cuts, while Obama says any deal must include more tax revenue. And many Democrats in Congress are protective of the entitlement programs that Obama now is willing to touch.

This year, House Republicans passed a budget that would eventually turn Medicare into a voucher-like program for people younger than 55. But Obama says he is dead-set against the plan, which is championed by Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Ryan was the Republican candidate for vice president.

Obama's approach to Medicare savings, known during the campaign, is different. He'd cut payments to drug companies, hospitals and other service providers. He's also proposing to have a growing share of seniors pay higher premiums over time, based on their incomes. As well, richer people will pay a higher Medicare payroll tax.

On Medicaid, though, the government has offered to foot more than 90 percent of the bill for states that expand the program to bring in millions of uninsured low-income adults. States worry Washington might shift costs back to them later.

For years, budget hawks have insisted that huge entitlements must be on the table for meaningful fiscal discipline to be achieved in Washington. Whether the effort to rein in their spending succeeds or fails, it's clear they're on the table now.

WASHINGTON — President Obama on Monday made an unscheduled visit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in his latest bid to draw attention to the effects of the government shutdown and to challenge Speaker John A. Boehner’s claim that he does not have enough votes to pass a measure to finance the government.

Mr. Boehner, appearing Sunday on the ABC News program “This Week,” said the Republican-controlled House could not pass a budget measure without provisions to limit Mr. Obama’s health insurance law. Democrats and some Republicans say that a bipartisan majority exists but that Mr. Boehner refuses to defy Tea Party conservatives.

At FEMA, Mr. Obama called on Mr. Boehner to put to a vote the Senate-passed stopgap bill to fund the government.

“The House should hold that vote today,” Mr. Obama said. “If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, then they should prove it. Let the bill go to the floor and let’s see what happens. Just vote. Let every member of Congress vote their conscience and they can determine whether or not they want to shut the government down. My suspicion is, my very strong suspicion is, that there are enough votes there.”

Turning up the pressure, Mr. Obama added, “The reason that Speaker Boehner hasn’t called a vote on it is because he doesn’t apparently want to see the government shutdown end at the moment, unless he’s able to extract concessions that don’t have anything to do with the budget.”

Like other federal agencies, FEMA is operating with reduced staff — 86 percent was furloughed, according to its chief, W. Craig Fugate, though some were temporarily called back to deal with storm response efforts, and the rest are working for now without pay. The agency has been busy coordinating with state and local governments to prepare for and respond to violent storms in the Midwest and Tropical Storm Karen.

The president used the appearance at the agency to reiterate his now-daily calls for Congress both to vote immediately to finance the government in the new fiscal year, which began last Tuesday, and to extend the nation’s borrowing limit, which the Treasury Department has estimated will be breached Oct. 17. Last Friday, he did the same with an unscheduled appearance at a local sandwich shop.

While the shutdown has posed myriad problems nationwide for citizens and businesses, failure to raise the debt ceiling could ultimately provoke the nation’s first default and lead to a global financial crisis.

House Republicans have refused to allow a vote on a Senate-passed funding measure until Mr. Obama negotiates limits or cutbacks in his signature health care law, which he has refused to do. The House in recent days has passed a number of bills funding various popular functions of the government, including FEMA, as public complaints have mounted, but the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate have rejected that piecemeal approach, demanding that the entire government be funded.

Mr. Boehner and other Republicans have excoriated Mr. Obama for his refusal to negotiate over their demands. Also at FEMA, Mr. Obama countered that line of attack.

“I have said from the start of the year that I’m happy to talk to Republicans about anything related to the budget,” Mr. Obama said. “There is not a subject that I am not willing to engage in, work on, negotiate and come up with common-sense compromises on. What I’ve said is that I cannot do that under the threat that if R’s don’t get 100 percent of their way they’re going to either shut down the government or they are going to default on America’s debt so that America for the first time in history does not pay its bills.”

“We’re not going to establish that pattern,” he added.

Separately, on Monday the president’s chief White House economic adviser, Gene B. Sperling, publicly reiterated what the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, has already told Congressional Republicans: the White House will let Congress decide how great an increase to provide in the nation’s soon-to-be-breached $16.7 trillion debt limit.

Mr. Lew, in a letter over the weekend to Senate Republicans, said that under the Constitution, “Only Congress can authorize an increase in the nation’s borrowing authority, and therefore Congress must choose how long to extend the debt limit.”

The Treasury secretary expressed a preference for bigger increase, which he did not quantify, to cover a longer time. “A longer period of certainty would help protect our economy from future political brinkmanship,” Mr. Lew wrote."

County officials worried about costs of immigration overhaul,"WASHINGTON — Few regions will absorb the impact of future immigration reforms more than Los Angeles County, home to an estimated 1.1 million people in the country illegally, one-tenth of the nation’s total.

As the Senate Judiciary Committee began debating the bipartisan immigration bill last week, county officials voiced concerns that local taxpayers will be “left holding the bag” to pay for the brunt of healthcare and other services for multitudes of immigrants who apply for citizenship.

Local and state officials believe the overhaul bill will encourage those in the country illegally to come out of the shadows and turn to local services during the proposed 13-year-long pathway to citizenship.

“The one thing that’s really clear as day is that the federal government is going to be protecting itself against costs, and we’re going to be left holding the bag,” said Mark Tajima, an analyst with the county’s chief administrative office.

In Washington last week for the start of the debate, county officials, including Supervisors Don Knabe and Zev Yaroslavsky, warned of a “major cost shift” to state and local governments from the proposed legislation and pressed Congress to provide federal aid to help cover future costs.

Officials could not, however, provide a figure on the potential tab. Instead, as they made the rounds on Capitol Hill, they pointed to the $800 million the county received in the last big immigration overhaul signed by President Reagan in 1986.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), after meeting with county officials, brought up the county’s concerns at the Judiciary Committee meeting and directed her staff to look into the possibility of creating a “state impact assistance” fund, similar to the $4 billion provided to local and state governments in the 1986 bill.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a leading critic of the bill, has cited the potential costs to taxpayers in assailing the measure.

In its current form, the bill would bar most immigrants seeking legal status from receiving federal benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid, during the years it would take to become legal residents or U.S. citizens.

The bill requires the federal government to have a plan to gain almost total control of the border, authorizing money for drones, customs officers and prosecution of illegal entries. People now in the country without legal status would be eligible for provisional status if they paid fees, fines and taxes. They could gain legal residency 10 years after the border was declared secure. After 13 years, they would be eligible for citizenship.

The National Conference of State Legislatures is urging Congress to allocate to local and state governments some of the fees paid by applicants for legalization. The legislation, however, calls for that money to be used to secure the border, a key element for Republican support.

The proposed bill also would bar most of those applicants from receiving subsidies to buy health insurance for 10 years. These subsidies, which are part of President Obama’s 2010 health law, will be available next year to millions of low- and moderate-income Americans and legal immigrants who do not get health benefits at work.

Many of the applicants for legalization also would be ineligible for other federal benefits for more than a decade. In contrast, legal immigrants are eligible for many federal benefits after five years in the country.

Immigrant rights advocates said that because applicants for legal status will pay taxes, they should be entitled to a safety net.

“If you give them lawful status, the hope is that they will have more opportunities to provide for themselves and their families without relying on benefits,” said Sonal Ambegaokar, health policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. “Even hard-working Americans can’t afford basic necessities these days.”

A memo to the Board of Supervisors from a top county government affairs officer said some of the provisions of the bills “would be especially unfair because newly legalized individuals would be paying taxes, fines and fees to the federal government, but state and local governments, such as the county, would have to bear most of the cost of services provided to them.”

Advertisement

Although the county provides emergency care to all, regardless of legal status, county officials say the legislation could significantly increase its costs for non-emergency care. They point to an estimate that up to 446,000 of such immigrants in the county have no health insurance.

Los Angeles County spends roughly $600 million a year on healthcare for immigrants in the country illegally, officials said.

Advertisement

States are also concerned about how they will pay for services, including English proficiency classes sought by applicants for legal status at a time when funding for such adult school programs has been cut. Community colleges and other institutions will be flooded with demand.

“For states like California and New York, there is the potential of a lot of people coming to the state and local government for assistance,” said Sheri Steisel, senior federal affairs counsel for the National Conference of State Legislatures. “Just because the federal government has decided not to provide access to federal benefit programs does not mean that the need goes away.”

Advertisement

County officials want Congress to create a fund similar to the $4-billion allocation in 1986 or make applicants for legal status eligible for federal benefits sooner. Some 720,000 of the 2.7 million immigrants granted amnesty nationwide as a result of the 1986 overhaul lived in Los Angeles County.

But with Washington awash in red ink and conservative lawmakers attacking the bill’s potential costs, securing such increased spending would appear a long shot.

But Steisel is hopeful, noting: “This is now a 50-state issue…. Everybody has a stake in this.”

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/opinion/inequality-for-dummies.html,2013-12-23 00:00:00,['Bill Keller'],Inequality for Dummies - The New York Times,"A stratified society in which the bottom and top are mostly locked in place is not just morally offensive; it is unstable. Recessions are more frequent in such countries. A widely praised 2012 book, “Why Nations Fail,” argues that historically when the ruling elites have pulled up the ladder and kept newcomers from getting a foothold, their economies have suffocated and died. “The most pernicious fact of inequality is when it translates into political inequality,” said Daron Acemoglu, a co-author of the book and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist. “That means our democracy ceases to function because some people have so much money they command greater power.” The rich spend heavily on lobbyists and campaign donations to secure tax breaks and tariff advantages and bailouts that perpetuate their status. Not only does a dynamic economy stagnate, but the left-out citizenry becomes disillusioned and cynical. Sound familiar?

The left-left sees economic inequality as mainly a problem of distribution — the accumulation of vast wealth that never really trickles down from on high. Their prescription is to tax the 1 percent and close corporate loopholes, using the new revenues to subsidize the needs of the poor and middle class. They would string the safety net higher: expand Social Security, hold Medicare inviolate, extend unemployment insurance, protect food stamps, create more low-income housing. They would raise the minimum wage.

The center-left — and that includes President Obama, most of the time — sees the problem and the solutions as more complicated. Yes, you want to provide greater security for those without independent means (see Obamacare), but you also need to create opportunity, which means, first and foremost, jobs. Yes, you can raise taxes on the rich, but you don’t want to punish success. “You want to increase social mobility by providing an opportunity for the bottom to become rich, not forcing the rich to become poor,” said Acemoglu, who aligns more with the center than with the populists.

The center-left (I’m somewhat oversimplifying these categories) agrees on the menace of inequality, but places equal or greater emphasis on the fact that the economy is not growing the way it did for most of the last century. The sluggish growth means that not only are the poorest stuck at the bottom, but the broad middle is in economic decline. “The central economic problem is that a middle-class wage does not make a middle-class life anymore,” said Jon Cowan, president of Third Way. This diagnosis leads to somewhat different priorities. Of the arguments that pit Democrat against Democrat, three strike me as most important:

The first is how to restart the engine of growth. The populists favor putting more money in the hands of the bottom and middle, who will then spend us back to economic vigor. This is classic Keynesian thinking, largely vindicated by history. But the center-left points out that our economy is already 70 percent dependent on domestic consumers, way more than other developed countries. Liberals of all shades favor greater government investments in education, infrastructure, clean energy and other research. But they divide over policies that might unleash the energy of the private sector. In a line from his speech that was not widely quoted, President Obama said, “The fact is if you’re a progressive and you want to help the middle class and the working poor, you’ve still got to be concerned about competitiveness and productivity and business confidence that spurs private-sector investment.” While closing loopholes, Obama would also lower corporate tax rates; he would do trade deals to expand our diminishing share of foreign markets; he would shrink long-term deficits and streamline regulations.

The second argument is over entitlements. The left-left seems to believe that government investments — roads and bridges, clean energy, education, etc. — and more-generous safety-net benefits can all be had by milking the rich and cutting military spending. Most centrists would raise taxes some and cut defense spending some, but they say that unless we also curb the growth of entitlements, the stampede of baby boomers into Social Security and Medicare will crowd out everything else. Between now and 2030, the working-age population that pays into Social Security grows by 15 percent; the over-65 population that withdraws from Social Security grows by 65 percent. No one on the left favors entrusting Social Security and Medicare to the mercies of the private marketplace, as some Republicans do. But while the left tends to treat entitlements as sacred (Senator Warren and others would increase benefits for everyone, even the rich), centrists favor measures to slow the growth of entitlements: using a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) formula that more accurately reflects how people spend, cutting benefits for those who don’t really need them, possibly extending the retirement age a couple of years, and using the government’s leverage to drive down the costs of medical care. The tension between entitlements and investment is a Third Way obsession. In a column and two blog posts last year (here, and here, and here) I sympathized with the case for imposing some restraint on entitlements. I still do."

With no agreement on a funding bill in sight, Republicans and Democrats continue to spar on Capitol Hill, while federal workers sit at home and the American public watches as an even more critical deadline on raising the federal debt limit nears.

The Senate rejected House amendments to a short-term spending bill Monday, pushing the government toward its first shutdown in nearly two decades.

by Lori Montgomery and Paul Kane

The U.S. government began to shut down for the first time in 17 years early Tuesday, after a Congress bitterly divided over President Obama’s signature health-care initiative failed to reach agreement to fund federal agencies.

Hours before a midnight deadline, the Republican House passed its third proposal in two weeks to fund the government for a matter of weeks. Like the previous plans, the new one sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act, this time by delaying enforcement of the “individual mandate,” a cornerstone of the law that requires all Americans to obtain health insurance.

The new measure also sought to strip lawmakers and their aides of long-standing government health benefits.

The Democratic-led Senate quickly rejected that plan on a party-line vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) urged House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to abandon the assault on the health-care law and pass a simple bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, Reid warned, “the responsibility for this Republican government shutdown will rest squarely on his shoulders.”

Boehner refused to yield. He instead won approval, in a 1 a.m. largely party-line roll call, requesting a special House-Senate committee to meet in the coming days to resolve differences between the two parties, leaving in limbo the fate of millions of federal workers and the services they provide.

Shortly before midnight, the White House budget office issued a memo instructing agencies to “execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.”

The impasse means 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed Tuesday. National parks, monuments and museums, as well as most federal offices, will close. Tens of thousands of air-traffic controllers, prison guards and Border Patrol agents will be required to serve, but their pay may be delayed. And many congressional hearings — including one scheduled for Tuesday on last month’s Washington Navy Yard shootings — will be postponed.

In a last-minute ray of hope for active-duty troops, Congress on Monday approved and sent to the White House an agreement to keep issuing military paychecks. But Obama warned that the broader economy, which is finally starting to recover from the shocks of the past six years, would take a substantial hit if congressional gridlock shutters “America’s largest employer.”

“Keeping the people’s government open is not a concession to me. Keeping vital services running and hundreds of thousands of Americans on the job is not something you ‘give’ to the other side. It’s our basic responsibility,” Obama said in a statement Monday evening at the White House.

Privately, senior Republicans predicted that the closure would last at least a week. A fraction of today’s House Republicans were on Capitol Hill in 1995 and 1996 when a Republican-led Congress last shut down the government in a dispute over the budget with a Democratic president. Younger lawmakers don’t remember the pain the shutdown caused constituents, senior Republicans said. And many of them now question the conventional wisdom that the closures weakened the GOP presidential candidate in 1996 and nearly cost the party control of the House.

Democrats predicted that if the shutdown stretches into the weekend, the government-funding dispute could be rolled into an even more serious battle over the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit. The Treasury Department will begin running short of cash to pay the nation’s bills as soon as Oct. 17 unless Congress approves additional borrowing authority. With so little time remaining to avoid what would be the nation’s first default, Democratic aides predicted that negotiations to reopen the government may be merged into the debt-limit talks.

On Monday evening, Obama telephoned Boehner to urge him to reconsider his stance on the health-care law. In a call that lasted nearly 10 minutes, according to Boehner’s office, the president reiterated his insistence that there would be no negotiations over the debt limit, and that Congress must pay the bills it has incurred.

Boehner responded by mocking Obama in a speech on the House floor.

“ ‘I’m not going to negotiate,’ ” he said, quoting Obama. “I would say to the president: This is not about me. It’s not about Republicans here in Congress. It’s about fairness.”

The speech drew applause for the embattled speaker, who argued passionately that Republicans were merely seeking “fairness” for working people. Obama has delayed a mandate for employers to insure workers and delayed other requirements for big unions, Boehner said. “Yet they stick our constituents with a bill they don’t like and a bill they can’t afford,” he said.

Despite the show of unity, Republicans on both sides of the Capitol remain deeply divided about the attack on the health-care law. In the House, a group of more moderate Republicans was seething about the decision to bow to the forces that oppose the Affordable Care Act, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his allies on the right, including such outside groups as Heritage Action for America.

On Monday, some publicly urged Boehner to drop the issue and seek the help of House Democrats to pass the simple government-funding bill that the Senate approved last week.

“I don’t want to shut down the government,” said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), who is trying to become her state’s first GOP senator since the 1950s, adding that she was inclined to support a “clean” funding bill.

Frustrations also were simmering among Senate Republicans, who complained that House leaders were pressing the attack in direct opposition to public opinion. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly disapprove of using the threat of a shutdown to defund the health-care law and that blame for a shutdown will fall squarely on Republicans.

“By wanting to repeal Obamacare using this method, it defies what the popular will is,” said Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who campaigned last year on behalf of his party’s national ticket.

“I campaigned in 2012 all over this country for months: ‘Repeal and replace Obamacare.’ That was not the mandate of the voters,” McCain said. “If they wanted to repeal Obamacare, the 2012 election would have been probably significantly different.”

Adding to the tension Monday was Boehner’s decision to add the provision that would strip lawmakers, congressional staff members and White House aides of the employer subsidies for health insurance they have received for many years.

Now that lawmakers and their aides must join the new health-insurance exchanges, some conservative groups have criticized the subsidies, worth about $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $10,000 for families, as a “special exemption” from the new law. By including the provision, House leaders hoped to attract conservative support and put pressure on Senate Democrats, who faced the choice of shutting down the government to protect their own perks.

“On what flooding peninsula can you stand when it’s a question of delaying the individual mandate, ending member subsidies and funding the government?” said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.). If Reid kills it, “the senators he’s going to protect become the subject of incredible scrutiny.”

Even some Republicans were uneasy about the prospect of dealing their aides — and some of their colleagues — the equivalent of a big pay cut. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) called it an “outrage,” adding that Boehner had worked directly with Reid and the Obama administration to make sure the subsidies would stay in place when congressional employees join the exchanges next year.

Boehner and his team presented the proposal to rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door meeting Monday. For more than an hour and a half, lawmakers argued about the plan. They emerged with an unusual number of public dissenters, including Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), one of a dozen Republicans who ultimately voted against the proposal.

“I don’t want to be the facilitator of a disastrous process and plan,” he said.

Still, most Republicans endorsed the deal, even if somewhat reluctantly. “I think this is a principled call by leadership and it has the support of the con­ference,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), one of Boehner’s closest friends.

Democrats, meanwhile, were united against any attempt by Republicans to extract concessions now, especially with the larger fight over the debt limit swiftly approaching.

“The bottom line is very simple,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “You negotiate on this, they will up the ante for the debt limit.”

http://news.yahoo.com/defiant-cruz-rails-against-u-fiscal-deal-wont-181038979--sector.html,,[],"Defiant Cruz rails against U.S. fiscal deal, but won't delay it","By David Lawder and Amanda Becker WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A defiant Senator Ted Cruz railed against a bipartisan U.S. Senate deal to lift the federal debt limit and reopen the government on Wednesday, but said he would not try to block or delay its passage. Cruz, a conservative Texas Republican, said he would vote against the measure because it provides no relief to Americans from what he calls the harmful effects of ""Obamacare"" health insurance reforms. However, he said that at this point there was nothing to gain from taking procedural measures to delay it. Cruz has waged a weeks-long campaign to persuade Republicans to use the threat of a government shutdown and failure to lift the federal debt limit as leverage to defund, delay, or otherwise undermine President Barack Obama's signature health care law. ""The timing of the vote will make no difference in the outcome, and so I don't intend to delay the timing of the vote. I intend to vote no,"" Cruz told reporters. ""It will be a bad deal for the American people today, tomorrow or the next day."" Under Senate rules, any senator can object to pending legislation, a move that would require a 60-vote majority to proceed to a yes or no vote. The process requires several days to complete, and with the U.S. Treasury set to exhaust its borrowing capacity on Thursday, time for passage is running short. In a campaign-style speech before cameras as the Senate deal was announced, Cruz said the bipartisan plan reflected ""the ""traditional approach of the Washington establishment of maintaining the status quo and doing nothing to respond to the suffering that Obamacare is causing to millions of Americans."" Although the health reform is aimed at providing affordable care to tens of millions of uninsured Americans, Cruz and other Republicans blame it for causing premiums to rise in some areas and for prompting companies to reduce hiring or to shift employees from full-time work to part-time work. In the end, the only Obamacare concession in Wednesday's Senate-negotiated deal was the inclusion of a provision requiring that those applying for insurance subsidies verify their income. Government-run health insurance exchanges started operating on October 1, and the deal does not alter a requirement that individuals obtain coverage starting on January 1 or pay a tax penalty. The deal still requires passage in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 'COURAGEOUS STAND' Lawmakers and aides from both parties on Capitol Hill have criticized Cruz for using his fight against Obamacare, which included a well-publicized 21-hour speech on the Senate floor, as a personal platform to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. The Tea Party firebrand won election to the Senate only last November. Although Cruz has not announced his formal intention to run for president, some political analysts say the fame he has gained from his recent efforts has elevated him to a leading Republican contender, alongside House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the party's 2012 vice presidential candidate, and fellow conservative Senator Rand Paul. Cruz defended his efforts to use the fiscal deadlines to try to thwart Obamacare, saying he was doing what Americans wanted. Despite the government shutdown, which has forced the temporary layoff of hundreds of thousands of government employees, and angst in financial markets as to whether the United States would default on its obligations, Cruz said the effort was worth it as it had caused ""millions upon millions of people rise up"" against Obamacare. He praised House Republicans, whose demands for Obamacare concessions - and their refusal by Democrats - forced much of the government to close on October 1. ""We saw the House of Representatives take courageous stand listening to the American people, that everyone in official Washington just weeks ago said would never happen. That was a remarkable victory to see the House engage in a profile in courage."" He blamed the failure to stop the health care law on Senate Republicans who had failed to unite in the fight over the fiscal deadlines. ""I would point out, that had Senate Republicans united, and supported House Republicans, the outcome of this I believe would've been very, very different,"" he said.

Samuelson', 'Former Columnist Focusing On Economics', 'March', 'Robert J. Samuelson Wrote A Twice-Weekly Column On Economics. He Retired In September']",Robert Samuelson: A dishonest budget debate,"“The president is in the midst of a charm offensive.”

— The Post, referring to President Obama’s meetings with congressional Republicans

We don’t need a charm offensive; we need a candor offensive. The budget debate’s central reality is that federal retirement programs, led by Social Security and Medicare, are crowding out most other government spending. Until we openly recognize and discuss this, it will be impossible to have a “balanced approach” — to use one of President Obama’s favorite phrases. It’s the math: In fiscal 2012, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and civil service and military retirement cost $1.7 trillion, about half the budget. If they’re off-limits, the burdens on other programs and tax increases grow ever greater.

It’s already happening. The military is shrinking and weakening: The Army is to be cut by 80,000 troops, the Marines by 20,000. As a share of national income, defense spending ($670 billion in 2012) is headed toward its lowest level since 1940. Even now, the Pentagon says budget limits hamper its response to cyberattacks. “Domestic discretionary spending” — a category that includes food inspectors, the FBI, the National Weather Service and many others — faces a similar fate. By 2023, this spending will drop 33 percent as a share of national income, estimates the Congressional Budget Office. Dozens of programs will be squeezed.

Nor will states and localities escape. Federal grants ($607 billion in 2011) will shrink. States’ Medicaid costs will increase with the number of aged and disabled, which represent two-thirds of Medicaid spending. All this will force higher taxes or reduce traditional state and local spending on schools, police, roads and parks.

The budget debate may seem inconclusive, but it’s having pervasive effects. Choices are being made by default. Almost everything is being subordinated to protect retirees. Solicitude for government’s largest constituency undermines the rest of government. This is an immensely important story almost totally ignored by the media. One reason is that it’s happening spontaneously and invisibly: Growing numbers of elderly are simply collecting existing benefits. The media do not excel at covering inertia.

Liberals drive this process by treating Social Security and Medicare as sacrosanct. Do not touch a penny of benefits; these programs are by definition progressive; all recipients are deserving and needy. Only a few brave liberals complain that this dogma threatens programs for the non-aged poor. “None of us wants to impose new burdens on vulnerable seniors,” write economists Harry J. Holzer of Georgetown University and Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution in The Post. But “for how long will we continue to sacrifice investments in our nation’s children and youth ... to spend more and more on the aged?”

Hypocritical conservatives are liberals’ unspoken allies. Despite constant grumbling about entitlements, they lack the courage of their convictions. Consider House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s latest budget plan. From 2014 to 2023, he proposes cutting federal spending by $4.6 trillion. Not a cent comes from Social Security, while Medicare cuts are tiny, about 2 percent. His major Medicare proposal (in effect, a voucher) wouldn’t start until 2024. Most baby boomers escape meaningful benefit cuts. As Holzer and Sawhill fear, most of Ryan’s cuts affect programs for the poor.

What frustrates constructive debate is muddled public opinion. Americans hate deficits but desire more spending and reject higher taxes. In a Pew poll, 87 percent of respondents favored present or greater Social Security spending; only 10 percent backed cuts. Results were similar for 18 of 19 programs, foreign aid being the exception.

Only the occupant of the bully pulpit can yank public opinion back to reality. This requires acknowledging that an aging America needs a new social compact: one recognizing that longer life expectancies justify gradual increases in Social Security’s and Medicare’s eligibility ages; one accepting that sizable numbers of well-off retirees can afford to pay more for their benefits or receive less; one that improves generational fairness by concentrating help for the elderly more on the needy and poor to lighten the burdens — in higher taxes and fewer public services — on workers; and one that limits health costs.

Obama hasn’t talked intelligently or openly about America’s aging. In budget negotiations, the administration has made some proposals (a different inflation adjustment for Social Security benefits, a higher Medicare eligibility age) that broach the subject. But Obama hasn’t put these modest steps into the larger context of social change; nor is it clear how much the administration supports them. It’s true that Republicans should also accept higher taxes — but only after the White House engages retirement spending.

Little is possible while public opinion remains frozen in contradiction. The mistake lies in thinking that the apparent paralysis isn’t policy. It is. Government is being slowly transformed into a vast old-age home, with everything else devalued and degraded.

When asked if President Obama had an incentive to negotiate with the GOP, Halperin explained that, “The White House does not have much incentive. They think the trends are going to go in their direction at the end of the week, or early next week at the latest; because again, the press is largely sympathetic to their arguments on this.”

In short: The government is going to shut down because Obama knows the media has his back and therefore feels no pressure to enter into negotiations that might avert a shutdown. In fact, Obama is apparently okay letting the government shut down because he knows the media won’t make him pay a political price for it.

So what we have here is the media’s pro-Obama bias as a big factor in a potential shutdown.

As we have seen all year, when it comes to settled laws on issues such as gun control, voter ID, and immigration, the media are big believers in the kind of “civil bipartisan compromise” that results in changing those laws — as long as all that “civil bipartisan compromise” comes from the GOP.

But the media have completely abandoned their championing of “civil bipartisan compromise” with respect to this budget crisis, and as a result, Obama knows he has the media on his side and is therefore comfortable in his position not to negotiate. And Obama’s refusal to compromise is hurtling America towards a government shutdown.

What we have here is a situation wherein media bias is helping to inflame a crisis. In other words, were the media acting responsibly, objectively, and professionallly, this would actually decrease the chances of a shutdown. Obviously, though, the media wants its cake and to eat it too. The media are behaving in a way that increases the chances of a shutdown and then the media will blame the GOP for what the media helped cause.

Now we also know why Obama felt so secure golfing during this weekend’s shutdown crisis, instead of rolling up his sleeves like a leader to make a deal. Why not? He knows the media won’t blame him for anything, including shutting down the government.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — A majority of Americans now disapprove of the way President Obama is handling his job, while Americans' assessment of the way he is handling the economy has hit a nadir for his nearly 5-year-old presidency, according to a new Pew Research Center poll published Friday.

Forty-one percent of those polled approve of how he's handling his job, while 53% disapprove. That's a 14-point drop since December, according to Pew.

Obama's job ratings on the economy have been underwater for more than four years, but the current measure is the worst of his presidency — 31% approve of the way Obama is handling the economy, and 65% disapprove.

The Pew survey, which was conducted Oct. 30-Nov. 6, found that majorities disapprove of the way the president is handling five of six issues tested. Terrorism was the lone exception, with 51% approving of his performance, and 44% disapproving. But even on terrorism, his ratings are lower than they were earlier this year, according to the poll.

Obama's slump resembles the trajectory of George W. Bush, who saw approval of his job performance rating tumble 12 points, from 48% in December 2004 to 36% at the same point in his presidency, according to Pew.

Also notable was Obama's considerable slide in the poll among those who identify themselves as independents.

Only 32% of independents approve of his job performance, while 61% disapprove. In December, 53% approved and 39% disapproved.

Like Bush, Obama retains broad support among members of his own party, though the share of Democrats who give him a positive job rating has fallen 10 points over the past year, from 88% to 78%.

Obama's job rating among Republicans, extremely low last December at 12%, has changed little since then.

The president, who has been battling the fallout from problems with the rollout of his signature health care law, received negative ratings on health care policy, with 37% approving of his performance and 59% disapproving.

The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, was completed before Obama apologized in an NBC News interview Thursday that some Americans are losing their health insurance plans as a result of the Affordable Care Act, despite his repeated assurances over the past four years that Americans could keep their plans if they like them.

The resolution that is at the root of this crisis already establishes sequestration-level funding that President Obama and Senate Democrats have repeatedly said is unacceptably low but which they were willing to swallow in order to avoid a government shutdown.

That is the kind of compromise that, under normal circumstances, Republicans should celebrate. They got Democrats to accept a continuation of drastic, across-the-board spending cuts that are anathema to the president and his base. And yet members of the Tea Party, from Senator Ted Cruz to Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, have driven the Republican Party so far though the looking glass that even a compromise that so greatly favored their side has not been enough.

[pullquote]

The American public knows this, which is why the Tea Party does damage to the Republican Party the longer this crisis drags on.

Public opinion polls continue to show that voters overwhelmingly blame Republicans for the pain this shutdown is inflicting.

House Speaker John Boehner knows this but will do nothing to stop it. His agenda is not to win national or statewide elections or even to save the Republican Party from the kamikaze pilots who have taken it over. His sole priority is to save his speakership, which is why he will not bring a clean continuing resolution to the floor and allow an up-or-down vote.

Republican complaints that the president and Senate Democrats refuse to compromise ring hollow.

“Compromise,” to these demagogues, is to mandate that Democrats scrap President Obama’s signature domestic legislative accomplishment, which was passed by Congress, signed into law by the president, upheld by the Supreme Court and ratified by voters who returned its architect to the White House last November.

Belatedly, Republicans have complained that Senate Democrats won’t compromise by refusing to go to a budget conference committee. This request was all the more insincere when it arrived immediately before the government was due to shut down this week.

Senate Democrats, of course, had been begging for a budget compromise for months – ever since the senate passed its budget last spring. But Republicans rejected this attempt at compromise 18 times, refusing to allow the Senate and House of Representatives to go to a budget conference to hammer out a deal that would have put an end to this cycle of continuing resolutions.

The reality, of course, is that Republicans do not want a compromise. Their behavior this week is a final grasp at strangling a health care bill they were unable to defeat legislatively, judicially or electorally.

Republicans could have been scoring political points by pointing out all the glitches with the health care exchanges that went live on the same day they decided to shut down the government.

Instead, the public’s focus has been on their intransigence and the myopia with which a small, nationally reviled faction has managed to hold the will of the American people hostage.

This could have been the week when Republicans celebrated a continuation of austerity, across the board spending cuts and all the fiscal policies they had been rhetorically touting for decades.

Democrats compromised by giving away the store on sequestration-level funding. Too bad that the Tea Partiers driving the train in Washington these days are too wild-eyed to see it."
http://news.yahoo.com/survey-many-conflicted-govt-spending-cuts-201117576--politics.html,,[],Survey: Many conflicted on gov't spending cuts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As President Barack Obama and lawmakers spar over huge federal deficits, they're confronted by a classic contradiction: Most Americans want government austerity, a survey shows, but they also want increased spending on a host of popular programs: education, crime fighting, health care, Social Security, the environment and more. Less for defense, space and foreign aid.

The newly released General Social Survey asked people whether they believe spending in specific categories is ""too much,"" ''too little"" or ""about right."" It covers the public's shifting priorities from 1973, when Richard Nixon was president, through 2012 with Obama in the White House.

""Despite a dislike of taxes, more people have always favored increases in spending than cuts,"" wrote the survey's director, Tom W. Smith, of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.

While people's priorities shift over the years, they've not changed on one category. Foreign aid has been stuck firmly in last place since the survey began. Last year, 65 percent of those surveyed thought there was ""too much,"" 25 percent checked ""about right"" and a slim 11 percent said ""too little."" The numbers are not much changed from 1973 — when 73 percent said too much on foreign aid, 22 percent just right and 5 percent too little.

Various polls have consistently shown the public believes foreign aid is a far bigger slice of the spending pie than it actually is.

Foreign aid amounts to loose change, hovering for years at 1 percent or less of the federal budget, compared with defense spending and ""entitlement"" programs like Social Security and Medicare. Those are among the biggest deficit drivers and a focal point in Washington's recent budget debates. The survey shows the public is largely opposed to cuts in entitlement programs but tilts toward cuts in the defense budget.

To reach all these conclusions, Smith devised an index that boils down his findings to a single number for each category. If everyone favored more spending for a given program area, the maximum score would be +100; and if everyone wanted less spending, the score would be a negative number, -100.

Story continues

On this scale, top-ranked ""improving education"" in 2012 scored +68.4 while bottom-rated foreign aid scored a -60.4.

Support for defense spending has swung back and forth between negative and positive over four decades. It posted a -28.4 in 1973 near the end of the politically divisive Vietnam War, turned positive in 1978 and peaked at +48.9 in 1980. It returned to negative territory from 1983 to 2000. But after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks and the start of the war in Afghanistan, support for more defense spending again went positive — through 2004. But it turned negative again as U.S. military involvement in Iraq increased and has been negative ever since.

Conversely, Social Security has always been in positive territory. Most people have favored increased spending on this program since the mid-80s, with the exception of 1993 and 1994.

On other issues: Most Americans in the poll favored increased spending for assistance to the poor (64 percent), improving the nation's health (61 percent) and Social Security (56 percent). Most also favored greater spending on domestic and social issues including education (76 percent), developing alternative energy sources (62 percent), reducing the crime rate (59 percent), improving the environment (57 percent) and dealing with drug addiction (56 percent).

Despite all this support for increasing spending, the survey found that 52 percent believed their own federal income taxes last year were too high, 46 percent said about right and just 3 percent said too low.

Taxes are a sore point in efforts to strike a deficit-reduction deal on Capitol Hill. The president insists any new package must contain a mix of spending cuts and new revenues from limiting tax deductions benefiting the wealthy. Republicans, especially those who control the House, adamantly oppose new taxes on the wealthy and corporations.

Of the 23 categories in the survey, only five received negative scores — foreign aid (-60.4), welfare (-28.5), assistance to big cities (-23.4), space exploration (-9.0) and defense spending (-6.3)

If the people participating in the survey were to make federal budget decisions, those five programs presumably would be the only ones to see their spending slashed. The other 18 would get more money.

Those surveyed last year also wanted more government spending on: nonwelfare assistance to the poor (+53.8), fighting crime (+51.9), Social Security (+47.6), health programs (+46.3), protecting the environment (+45.9), drug rehabilitation (+43.5), highways and bridges (+29.9), solving problems of big cities (+24.1) and improving the condition of blacks (+21).

""The net numbers have always been positive, meaning they want to spend more on things. And the vast majority of them are things that are pretty good: education, health, highways,"" Smith said in an interview. ""The average — when asked about specific programs — is pro-government spending and always has been. It's gone up and down as to how pro they are. The pro-spending edge is a little weaker now than it was at its peak.""

Some changes in national priorities are generationally driven and the aging of baby boomers is an important factor as more and more retire.

""The retirees generally think things are about right. Pre-retirees are the group most likely to say (spending on Social Security) is too low. And the youngest generation is the least concerned about putting money into Social Security,"" Smith said.

In other findings:

— Now in second place for more spending, assistance to the poor has rebounded from its 10th place finish in 1996.

— After a first-place rank in 2004, spending on health programs slipped to sixth place in 2012.

— Halting crime was a top favorite for increased government spending from 1974 to 1988 and regained first place in 1993 and 1994. But after 1994, it dropped from +71.4 to +50.6 in 2002 — still a strong positive but the lowest for the category ever posted in the survey. In 2012, crime-fighting finished in third place at +51.6.

The General Social Survey is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with principal funding from the National Science Foundation. Data were collected between March and early September 2012 in face-to-face interviews with 1,974 randomly selected U.S. adults. The margin of sampling error varies for questions within the survey, but for most, it is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Now their goal is to balance the federal budget in 10 years.

Leading the charge will be Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, who is drafting the GOP's proposed 2014 budget.

Ryan's budget last year was savaged by Democrats for its spending cuts, among other things. But even that budget, which would have slashed deficits significantly, would not have resulted in a balanced budget until close to 2040.

So how realistic is it now for Republicans to balance the budget within 10 years?

""Technically it's plausible. ... But politically it may be too much,"" said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.

One reason it may be plausible is that the House will be putting out what's called a budget resolution, which sets broad targets for spending and revenue. It's the starting point in a months-long process and doesn't require lawmakers to offer all details on how to meet those targets.

In addition, a budget resolution is based on a set of policy and economic assumptions -- and small changes to things like economic growth forecasts can make a big difference to the bottom line, Penner said.

Another reason: Ironically, given Republicans' opposition to raising taxes, Ryan's job will be made somewhat easier this year by the more than $600 billion in new revenue that will be raised thanks to the fiscal cliff deal that Congress passed over New Year's.

For instance, Ryan's budget last year would have racked up a roughly $250 billion deficit in 2022. The new revenue would reduce that to about $130 billion, according to estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

A balanced budget is virtually guaranteed to be a non-starter with Democrats. Their goal is to stabilize the debt by the end of the decade. That is, reduce annual deficits enough so that total public debt remains constant as a share of the economy.

Related: House passes bill to defuse debt ceiling

Democrats are also likely to reject the House Republican budget proposal because it's likely to include more of the controversial proposals they rejected from Ryan's budget last year.

Ryan proposed lower spending levels than those set by the 2011 Budget Control Act and called for Medicare to include a premium support system starting in 2023. He also wanted to convert funding for Medicaid, food stamps and other low-income programs to block grants.

So for House Republicans to reach a balanced budget within 10 years -- and to do so only through spending cuts, since they've ruled out raising any more tax revenue -- they would have to do much more, and sooner.

It's a fair bet that health care entitlement changes will be central to the effort.

""Like most in the private sector, we want to transition from a defined benefit scenario to a defined contribution scenario. But you need to affect some real reforms in health care delivery and compensation and payment,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told CNN's Ali Velshi this week.

One way to get to a balanced budget faster might be to enact Ryan's Medicare premium-support model in 2018, five years earlier than in his previous budget, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Or reduce Medicare provider payments. Or raise current retirees' Medicare cost-sharing.

Or all of the above.

Independent deficit hawks aren't pushing for a balanced budget within a decade because it would require drastic changes that could hurt the economy and couldn't fully address long-term drivers of debt. At the same time, they say Democrats' goal of stabilizing the debt is only a first step. Health care costs must be brought down and entitlement programs reformed or the debt would soon start growing again.

It may be several weeks before Ryan unveils his budget. In the meantime, all eyes will be on the Congressional Budget Office, which will release its latest budget and economic outlook for the next decade on Feb. 4. That will give a much clearer sense of the magnitude of changes needed to balance the budget anytime soon."

Republicans on the skids,"We've talked a lot lately about how rough the GOP is having it of late. But in case you want to see what that looks like in the polling composite, it's as glorious as you might imagine:



In my decades of polling, I recall only one moment when a party had been driven as far from the center as the Republican Party has been today [...] I see little reason to believe that the staunch conservative bloc will wither away or splinter; it will remain a dominant force in the GOP and on the national stage. At the same time, however, I see no indication that its ideas about policy, governance and social issues will gain new adherents. They are far beyond the mainstream.

Democrats need to win the popular vote in 2014 by about seven points to take the House. So far, so good. It's early, obviously, but who doesn't like those trends? And it's not as if the GOP is doing the things it needs to do to reverse them. As legendary pollster Andrew Kohut (founder of Pew and president of Gallup when they were good) notes:The GOP's dilemma is obvious: evolve now, and risk a massive backlash among its base, rendering it unelectable for along freakin' time. Don't evolve, and remain far from the American mainstream, rendering it unelectable forever. It's a lose-lose situation, which in all truth, is everything the GOP deserves."

The 50-49 final vote came just before 5 a.m., a dramatic legislative lollapalooza in a stately chamber chiefly populated by men and women fast approaching Medicare age. Congress now adjourns for a two-week Easter recess.

Like the far more austere Republican budget approved by the House last week, the Democratic version that passed the Senate is a partisan document that sets out the party’s vision but does not have the force of law.

The $3.7-trillion Democratic blueprint for 2014 would raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy, trim spending modestly, and invest new revenue to build infrastructure and tamp down the federal deficit. Under the plan, the government would still be in the red a decade from now.

Passage of the plan sets the stage for contentious negotiations with the House and the White House next month over how to reconcile the two vastly dissimilar blueprints. The GOP plan is far to the right of President Obama’s views on the federal budget, while the Democratic version falls to his left.

The White House applauded the vote, saying in a statement that the plan “will create jobs and cut the deficit in a balanced way. Like the President’s plan, the Senate budget cuts wasteful spending, makes tough choices to strengthen entitlements, and eliminates special tax breaks and loopholes for the wealthiest Americans to reduce the deficit.”

The House Republican budget, the statement said, “refuses to ask for a single dime of deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well-connected but instead makes deep cuts to education and manufacturing while asking seniors and the middle class to pay more. That’s not an approach we support and it’s not an approach the majority of the American people support.”

Republicans marked the occasion by hammering Democrats for finally passing a budget after four years.

“It’s about time,” said a one-line news release from the House GOP whip, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield.

No Republicans voted for the plan. Four red state Democrats who face re-election next year opposed it, leading to the squeaker of a final vote. The four Democrats were Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Kay Hagen of North Carolina, Mark Begich of Alaska and Max Baucus of Montana.

“While there are clear areas of disagreement about how to strengthen our economy and restore our nation’s fiscal health,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the chairwoman of the Budget Committee, “this was a productive conversation and one I hope we can build on in the coming weeks.”

Extra supplies were brought into the Capitol late Friday — wood for the fireplaces on a chilly spring night, packaged meals for the take-out shelves — as senators hunkered down for a long night.

Under Senate rules, the budget debate offered senators an unusual opportunity to offer an unlimited number of amendments to debate. And they did.

More than 600 amendments were filed on the bill, from the lofty to the parochial. They included proposals to de-fund new healthcare laws, to restrict potential surveillance by domestic drone aircraft, and to prevent a Western bird called the sage grouse from being listed as an endangered species. Like some members of the Senate, it is known for its strutting displays.

Senators presented their issues in rapid-fire fashion and then called for a vote. The usually lonely Senate floor was filled with senators and aides. Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), had suggested 66 amendments by the time the sun set Friday.

The lawmakers began the long night knowing only that the final budget vote would come when they had finished all the others.

“We are not at carnival stage yet,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said near midnight, as the senators gamely pressed on.

Senators dispatched with several key amendments.

They tossed aside the House GOP budget drafted by Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, which calls for deep cuts to the social safety net, including Medicare, and in an effort to achieve balance in 10 years. Five GOP senators defected on their party’s defining document.

Senators also voted down, largely on party lines, a proposal that would require a balanced budget.

Several GOP ideas to block money for Obama’s signature domestic achievement, the new healthcare law, fell by the wayside on party-line votes. Democrats on Friday celebrated its third anniversary. But an amendment to halt the law’s tax on medical devices won bipartisan approval.

Women benefited from the exercise, as Republicans showed no interest in fighting Democratic proposals to ensure equal pay and reproductive care. Both issues were approved.

And the proposed Keystone oil pipeline, between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, drew broad bipartisan support.

As the night wore on, senators were essentially trapped on the Senate floor waiting for the final vote. Murray warned her colleagues, many of whom also had an avid interest in the March Madness basketball games, not to stray too far.

“You leave at your own peril,” she said.

In the end, most of the amendments were political messaging to show where senators stand on certain issues — and to provide fodder for campaigns targeting senators up for re-election.

One outcome was guaranteed: paychecks for the senators.

Failure to approve budgets this year would have suspended pay for the lawmakers under a provision slipped into a law earlier this year by House Republicans to goad Democratic senators into presenting their own budget proposal — and saving their $174,000 a year salaries.

As congressional leaders negotiate a deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling, Chris Cillizza explains why any deal they strike will probably come down to the wire. (The Washington Post)

Senate leaders said late Monday that they were closing in on a deal to raise the federal debt limit and end the two-week-old government shutdown, just days before the Treasury Department exhausts its ability to borrow.

The emerging agreement would extend the Treasury Department’s borrowing authority until Feb. 7, reopen the government and fund federal agencies through mid-January, according to aides and lawmakers familiar with the negotiations.

In the meantime, policymakers would launch a new round of talks over broader budget issues in hopes of developing a plan to replace deep automatic spending cuts known as the sequester before Jan. 15. That is when the next round of sequester cuts is scheduled to slice another $20 billion out of agency budgets, primarily from the Pentagon.

The framework under consideration includes only minor changes to President Obama’s signature health-care law, falling well short of defunding it or delaying major provisions as conservative Republicans initially sought. Instead, Republicans would get only new safeguards to ensure that people who receive federal subsidies to purchase health insurance under the law are eligible to receive them.

But talks were hung up over another provision, aides and lawmakers said: a demand by Democrats to delay the law’s “belly button tax,” a levy on existing policies that is set to add $63 per covered person — including spouses and dependents — to the cost of health insurance next year. Republicans derided the proposal as a special favor to organized labor.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.

Meanwhile, Democrats were resisting a GOP demand to deny Treasury Secretary Jack Lew the use of special measures to extend his borrowing power past Feb. 7. That would give Congress a firm deadline for the next debt-limit increase, with no wiggle room for Treasury Department accountants.

Despite those points of contention, Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared confident that they had developed a framework that could win the approval of Congress and spare the country from a first-ever default on the national debt.

“We’ve had a good day,” McConnell said in a speech closing the Senate for the evening. “I think it’s safe to say we’ve made substantial progress and we look forward to making more progress in the future.”

Reid agreed. “We’ve made tremendous progress. We are not there yet, but tremendous progress. And everyone just needs to be patient,” he said. “Perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day.”

The big question mark Monday evening was whether the emerging agreement could win the approval of the Republican-controlled House, where a small bloc of conservatives has managed to direct GOP strategy.

While McConnell and Reid were at work on a bipartisan compromise, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was continuing to promote a more partisan bill that would lift the debt limit for only six weeks.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) met midafternoon with McConnell and then huddled with his own leadership team. Afterward, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) declined to say what path the House would take.

“There’s a lot of different options we still have,” McCarthy said, adding that passing the Ryan plan is “always a possibility.”

There were signs that some House conservatives were growing anxious about the Senate talks. Rep. Raúl R. Labrador (R-Idaho), one of the most hard-line conservatives in the House, accused his Senate colleagues of “pussyfooting around” in the budget battle.

“The problem with Senate Republicans is that they always want to have a fight the next time,” Labrador said on CNN.

But Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a close Boehner ally, said he was confident that McConnell would not sign off on a deal unless Boehner was convinced that it could win a broad majority of Republicans.

“McConnell, I don’t think, will deliberately put us in a bad position,” Cole said, adding that any agreement that creates a process to litigate broader budget issues would achieve an important GOP goal. “If you’re able to do that and you’re able to get some savings out of the entitlement portion of the budget, those aren’t Republican defeats. They are Republican victories.”

After weeks in which no one was negotiating about anything, Monday was a day of near-constant activity. It began with a two-hour gathering of a bipartisan group of 12 senators led by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), the primary sponsor of a separate proposal that appeared to gain strength Friday before fizzling amid Democratic opposition over the weekend.

After that meeting, the Republican members briefed McConnell and the Democrats briefed Reid. Collins said the group was “continuing to discuss the parameters of a deal” but acknowledged that “there really is a focus on leadership right now.”

Later, Reid ventured twice from his office just off the Senate floor, around the corner and down the hall to McConnell’s office, where the two spoke face to face. At midday, McConnell and Boehner met — the speaker was spied briefly as he made his way down a back hallway from his office to McConnell’s suite for a 25-minute update.

The White House had announced in the morning that Reid, McConnell, Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would come downtown at 3 p.m. to brief the president on their progress. But that meeting was postponed amid concern that it would interrupt the talks just as they were making headway.

With lawmakers trickling slowly back into Washington after a weekend at home, Republican leaders in both chambers decided to delay briefing rank-and-file lawmakers about the day’s developments until everyone was in town Tuesday morning.

It was unclear how things would proceed from there.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the ringleader of the failed effort to attack the health-care law, waved off questions from reporters about whether he would try to block the Senate from approving an agreement, if one were reached.

“We need to see what the details are,” he said repeatedly.

But Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another conservative, said he has little appetite for obstruction, even if he does not like the final deal. “We need to get an agreement and open the government back up,” he said.

Still, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has been close to the talks, acknowledged that the emerging agreement would be “a tough vote.” The misguided assault on the health-care law had diverted attention from more meaningful efforts to overhaul the tax code and rein in spending on Medicare and Social Security, he said. And now time has run out for achieving those goals.

“Let’s just spell out what’s happened: We’ve basically blown the last two months with some of our members and a lot of the House focused on a shiny object that was never going to happen,” he said. “To try to put something together in three days that has meaningful things we all would like to see in it is just not possible.”

As talks intensified, Obama warned that if the standoff is not resolved by Thursday, when the Treasury Department will run out of borrowing authority, “we stand a good chance of defaulting.”

U.S. financial markets fell slightly in morning trading but then stabilized. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each dropped about 0.5 percent in the first 90 minutes of trading before rebounding to close with gains. In a more telling sign of market sentiment, the Vix, a measure of expected future volatility in stock markets, soared more than 12 percent before ending the trading day up 2.2 percent.

Bond markets were closed for the Columbus Day holiday. In recent days, investors have sold off short-term Treasury bills maturing later in October, fearful that there could be disruptions that prevent the government from making good on its obligations.

Although specific details are murky and subject to change, the broad outlines of the deal indicate a complete victory for Sen. Harry Reid and the Democrat caucus. With the partial government shutdown entering its third week, it looks increasingly likely that the GOP will gain next to nothing from the stand-off.

The deal negotiated between Reid and GOP Leader Mitch McConnell would reopen the government through January 15th. The GOP had sought to lock-in lower levels of spending due to next year’s sequester cuts, but that seems off the table now. The deal would also raise the debt ceiling until early February. It sets up another contentious fight over spending and debt in the critical 2014 election year.

In exchange, the GOP secured the creation of a large bi-cameral, bi-partisan commission or committee to explore budget and spending reforms. It also secured a provision to force the Obama Administration to take steps to verify the income of people seeking ObamaCare subsidies. That requirement is in the existing law, but was waived recently by the Administration.

Democrats also seem to have secured a priority for their union allies. The deal, reportedly, would delay for one year ObamaCare’s “reinsurance” tax on group plans. Repealing this tax was a key policy goal for labor.

It is hard to see this deal as anything but a complete capitulation by the GOP. The national debt would increase, without corresponding spending cuts or other reforms. Federal spending would resume at a higher level than required by the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011. Given the GOP’s inability to secure any meaningful reforms in these negotiations, it is hard to imagine it would fair better with a commission.

If a deal is reached Tuesday, it could still take several days to pass the Senate. Any one Senator can object to the deal, forcing the Senate to consider the deal through its Byzantine process. It isn’t likely to pass the Senate until well after Treasury’s October 17 deadline for new borrowing authority.

If the House gets the deal several days past the debt deadline, the chamber will come under extraordinary pressure to approve the deal."

Last year, I showed that the previous Congress was the least productive Congress in modern times, including the famous Do-Nothing Congress of 1947-48, passing just 238 laws, 37 percent of the average of the 32 Congresses that preceded it. In 2013, the first year of this Congress, the number of new laws passed fell further, to 55 (as of Nov. 30), seven fewer than during the same period in 2011. As a result, Congress now stands dead last in approval rating among key American institutions – below other braches of government, below news outlets, below banks and even below big business.

Congress well deserves that poll standing, in significant part because of the damage that it has done to the federal budget. The combination of Republican determination to cut spending and Democratic insistence that none of the entitlement programs (such as Medicare and Social Security) be meaningfully affected has resulted in the utterly inane policy of starving key domestic programs, including education, infrastructure and research and development. The recent budget fight and subsequent agreement did nothing to change that trajectory. As shown by the red line above, all that resulted was avoiding the worst two years of forced budget cuts to these programs; for the 10 years beginning in 2008, this important spending will rise slightly in nominal numbers but will fall by 5 percent, after adjusting for inflation.

The dysfunction in Washington has taken its toll in other important ways. Not only has business confidence been shaken, but each new political battle has also been terrifying for consumers. Back in the summer of 2011, when the United States had its AAA credit rating removed by S.&P. after it flirted with default, consumer confidence recorded the second biggest two-month drop ever, behind only the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. A smaller decline occurred at the end of 2012 when Congress nearly went over a fiscal cliff. Beginning this past July, consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in nearly two years as a result of the government shutdown, the A.C.A. problems and related battles. Now, a two-year budget nearly in hand, Americans’ moods seem to have improved. At a time when we need consumers to spend (prudently), these periods of faltering confidence have real economic consequences.

In contrast to the mood in most of the country and the still slow economy, Silicon Valley is partying again, albeit not quite like 1999. The Facebook initial public offering in May 2012 helped usher in a resurgence of excitement among investors for anything that looks like a sexy new high-tech service. This year’s poster child I.P.O. was Twitter, which set a new record of one kind among recent major technology I.P.O.'s: its valuation of more than 28 times its revenues. That didn’t daunt investors; the stock promptly more than doubled and now trades at 66 times revenues. (Of course, there are no profits.)"

An estimated 246%2C000 people over 50 are behind bars%2C report says

Some states creating special units to care for older prisoners

Cost of housing inmates over 50 reportedly twice as much as younger prisoners

ASBURY PARK, N.J. -- Convicted of three counts of robbery when he was still a young man, Steven Thomas has been in prison since December 1982. Now 62, frail and suffering from a relapse of Hepatitis C, he's one of an increasing number of inmates in New Jersey's correctional institutions who have grown old behind bars.

""I did a robbery when I was 27, 26 years old, and I've been locked up ever since,"" said Thomas, sitting at the edge of his hospital bed in a hospice unit at South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton. ""I wouldn't want to die here.""

Since 2000, the number of prisoners over age 50 in New Jersey's state prisons has jumped nearly 90 percent. There are now nearly 3,000 older prisoners in the state's eight adult correctional institutions.

The older prisoner population has continued to soar even as the number of adult offenders incarcerated in New Jersey state prisons has declined by 7 percent since 2009, to about 17,000 last year, according to state Department of Corrections figures.

Older prisoners are also the fastest growing segment of the U.S. prison population. There were an estimated 246,000 people over 50 behind bars last year, according to a 2012 American Civil Liberties Union report.

The growing number of older prisoners like Thomas represents a potential fiscal time bomb for the state and nation: Elderly prisoners cost more because almost all expenses related to their health care must be borne by state tax dollars.

If it costs New Jersey an average of $71,000 to care for each elderly inmate, as one study suggests, that would cost taxpayers $21.3 million -- about double the cost for the same number of younger, healthy inmates.

Some states, including Louisiana, have moved to make it easier for older, non-violent offenders to be released early, while others have created separate housing accommodations.

As of 2008, at least 13 states had units set aside solely for elderly prisoners, according to a 2010 Vera Institute of Justice report.

In New Jersey, Department of Corrections spokesman Matt Schuman said there are no ""special or unusual arrangements for the aging inmate population."" Older inmates are mixed in with general inmates.

""Is it morally and financially the right thing to keep them in prison?"" said Tina Maschi, a Fordham University professor who is conducting a study on New Jersey's older inmate population in an effort to develop programs aimed at improving the mental and physical health of elderly prisoners. ""In prison, are we turning a blind eye to the fact that we need to take a look at these older people differently?""

Schuman said the DOC is concerned about the growth in the older inmate population, but plans no changes ""in the immediate future."" Down the road, there may be rising medical costs and ""possibly a requirement for specialized housing,"" he said.

Dispute about who is 'old'

There is some disagreement among researchers and corrections experts as to the age at which an inmate becomes elderly.

The National Institute of Corrections considers prisoners over 50 to be ""elderly"" or ""aging."" That's because those who wind up behind bars have more frequently engaged in unhealthy behaviors -- like using narcotics or drinking -- than the general population. And they've also been less likely to receive regular medical care. Once they're locked up, the stress of prison life tends to prematurely age people, corrections experts say.

Since 1981, the number of prisoners over 55 has grown from about 9,000 nationwide to 124,900 last year. It's estimated to reach more than 400,000 by 2030, according to the ACLU report. Researchers in the study used the 55 and up age group to show the dramatic growth in the number of inmates since there is not enough data tracking 50 and up inmates over time.

Starting in the mid-1970s, a nationwide push to get tough on crime included enactment of mandatory minimum sentences and laws that sends offenders to prison for life if convicted of three serious offenses.

The result: The U.S. prison population soared, growing at 11 times the rate of the general population from 1980 to 2010. There are about 2.3 million people behind bars in the U.S., and with more inmates serving longer sentences, the number of elderly prisoners has also jumped.

In 2012, more than 70 percent of the inmates in New Jersey's state prisons were serving sentences that included mandatory minimum terms before parole, according to the corrections department.

""We have created this situation where people are destined to do long terms in a criminal justice system that was not designed to be a long-term care facility,"" Maschi said.

Elderly more expensive

A 2012 ACLU study estimated that it costs nearly $70,000 a year to house a prisoner over 50, compared with an average of $34,135 for a younger inmate. The increase is primarily driven by much higher health care costs for the older population.

Prisoners over 50 in New Jersey's state correctional facilities have the same health issues common in senior citizens anywhere. Some struggle with high blood pressure or failing eyesight. Some need canes or walkers to get around. Others may need heart bypass surgery or suffer from cancer or dementia.

But unlike those on the outside, prisoners don't qualify for Social Security payments and aren't eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. New Jersey has made prisoners give a $5 co-payment for their medical costs since the mid-1990s, if they are the ones who request medical care, Schuman said.

The co-pays can come from money prisoners earn while working, or from contributions from their families.

Most of the inmates' health care costs are paid for by the corrections department. Maschi said her survey of 667 inmates 50 or older showed 20 percent had vision problems, 17 percent suffered from arthritis, 15 percent had high blood pressure and 11 percent said they had difficulty walking. Nearly one-third had some type of mental illness.

In addition to more medical problems, older inmates, who often are more feeble than their younger counterparts, have a greater chance of being preyed upon by younger inmates looking for easy targets, experts say.

Special prisons, medical parole

Some states have responded to the growing number of elderly inmates by establishing separate prisons to house them, or unique programs to address their distinct needs. In Nevada, the ""True Grit"" program has helped reduce infirmary visits for about 200 prisoners by offering music and art therapy and physical exercise, including wheelchair basketball.

California is building a 1,700-bed prison to house medically infirm prisoners. In 2006, New York opened a special prison unit for the cognitively impaired at its Fishkill facility. Most of the prisoners in the unit suffer from dementia. Washington has an assisted living unit at one of its prisons.

Other states, like Louisiana, have passed laws making it easier for some elderly prisoners to be released after a parole hearing at which their risk for committing future crimes is assessed. Releasing some older prisoners early could shift the cost of their care from states to their family members, and make them eligible for federal programs like Medicaid, experts say.

New Jersey is one of 39 states that have medical parole laws, which allow for the release of seriously or terminally ill prisoners, according to the 2010 Vera Institute of Justice Report.

Sick inmates in New Jersey prisons may apply for medical parole, corrections spokesman Matt Schuman said. The Parole Board makes the final decision. But approval of such requests is ""very rare,"" he said.

The Vera Institute found that even states that have specific geriatric release policies rarely release older inmates. From 2001 to 2008, Colorado released three older offenders. Virginia released four from 2001 to 2007.

The ACLU report urges states to adopt a program similar to Louisiana's, allowing low-risk older offenders to leave prison. The report points to decades of research that shows crime rates decrease steadily after age 24. Almost no crimes are committed by those over 65. Research also shows that older offenders are much less likely to return to prison after they are released.

'I hope I don't die here'

Steven Thomas spends his days at South Woods State Prison in a small room that's part of an 80-bed extended care unit at the medium security facility. Sick inmates in the unit come from facilities all over the state, where they are treated by doctors and nurses in a unit that's similar to a small hospital, according to social work supervisor Rosalind Williams.

The majority are there only temporarily, while they convalesce. Those who are believed to have terminal illnesses, like Thomas, are put in the hospice unit, where some of their care is delivered by trained inmate volunteers.

Thomas dreams of someday leaving South Woods and seeing his three children. He said he regrets his criminal past and would like to go home before he dies. He was denied parole at a hearing in August 2012. His next parole hearing will not be until 2017.

""I did what I did and I take responsibility,"" he said. ""I am totally remorseful for what I did. I have expressed that.""

Thomas' chances of being released, though, are slim in New Jersey.

""I hope I don't die here, but it depends on when they decide to let me go,"" Thomas said. ""How likely am I to go out and do something, the way I am now?"""

This view ignores how much inequality has been made worse in the past few decades by government decisions. The emphasis on cutting taxes and spending that began in the Reagan years is a direct cause of economic insecurity now. It has led, for example, to education cuts that have harmed children in low-income school districts. Reversing those decisions can still have an enormous impact.

Mr. Obama did not reveal a sheaf of new ideas in his speech. But he did remind listeners of the many good ideas he has proposed about inequality over the years, most of which have been blocked by Republican opposition. A higher minimum wage would have an immediate effect on the buying power of millions of workers, stimulating growth and employment. Greater spending on high-quality preschool, a new emphasis on career and technical education and affordable higher education would all help to lower the barriers to economic mobility. Stronger collective-bargaining laws and nondiscrimination protections would help restore a balance in workplaces now tilted strongly toward employers.

And the Affordable Care Act, as Mr. Obama said forcefully, has enhanced security for millions of people who were previously uninsured or who lived in fear of losing their policies because of illness. “This law is going to work,” he said, “and for the sake of our economic security, it needs to work.” It will reduce personal bankruptcies, he said, cut sick time and keep children healthier and performing better in school.

What he should have added was the need to raise tax revenue, which is crucial to making the kinds of investments big enough to have a real effect on growth. The tax code must be overhauled to eliminate the absurdly generous breaks given to those at the very top — an idea that Mr. Obama has campaigned on but rarely brings up, given the implacable Republican opposition. But the president did issue a clear challenge to his opponents. Where are the Republican ideas for reducing the income gap? Most in the party don’t even recognize it as a problem. “You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for,” he said, “not just what you’re against.” The silence from Republicans explains why economic inequality is rising."

This ridiculous exercise is not just unwise and unproductive but ungrammatical as well.

I hate the way the sequester diverts attention from issues that actually matter, such as unemployment, gun violence, climate change, failing schools and the need to spur economic growth. I hate the way it heightens our insularity at a time when we really ought to be paying attention to the rest of the world. Remember Syria? Dictator Bashar al-Assad is still slaughtering civilians left and right. Wasn’t he supposed to be gone by now?

I hate the sequester’s artificiality. With all the nation’s problems, our leaders created a new one for political reasons — and then, for those same political reasons, they didn’t even try to solve it.

I hate the sequester’s essential ambiguity, its Janus-faced dual nature. It is punishing, cruel and counterproductive, as the White House insists; and it is also no big deal, as Republicans contend.

President Obama is correct when he says that the sequester’s blunt-instrument cuts will cause needless hardship, even if the administration has been alarmist and flat-out wrong with some of its warnings.

The president’s claim that janitors at the Capitol would receive a pay cut and Education Secretary Arne Duncan’s report that some teachers have already gotten pink slips both were awarded four Pinocchios by The Post’s “Fact Checker” columnist, Glenn Kessler. This roughly translates as “not even remotely true.”

But the administration’s dire warnings of airport congestion and flight delays are plausible, Kessler found, and perhaps inevitable. And while there have been no immediate furloughs or layoffs — in schools, government agencies or firms dependent on government contracts — the math suggests there will be.

However, Republicans are correct when they say: Come on, get real, we’re talking about an across-the-board cut of $85 billion, just 2 percent of the budget. While they’re wrong to claim that a cut of this magnitude will be painless, they’re right to point out that the republic will not crumble into dust.

Medicare will see no more than a 2 percent cut, while Medicaid and Social Security will be untouched. Since these programs are so big and costly, other parts of the budget will have to face much deeper cuts to make up the total $85 billion savings. Defense spending is slated to be hit hardest, with an annualized budget reduction of nearly 10 percent.

Republicans would be right to note that the Pentagon will still eat up about half of all “discretionary” federal spending — and that the United States’ position as the world’s leading military power would remain unchallenged. But they don’t want to point this out because the GOP is supposed to be the strong-on-defense party that never met a gazillion-dollar weapons system it didn’t like.

Which brings me to another thing I hate about the sequester: the political incompetence and miscalculation that produced it. To quote baseball legend Casey Stengel: Can’t anybody here play this game?

Obama figured that Republicans would be so horrified at the prospect of deep defense cuts that they would make a deal on his terms, even after being forced to accept a humiliating defeat — and a modest tax increase for the wealthy — in the “fiscal cliff” negotiations two months ago.

Ann Telnaes animation: Congress takes a recess. (Ann Telnaes/The Washington Post)

The president apparently didn’t foresee that the Republican Party’s activist base would approach the sequester deadline full of outrage, not resignation. And neither he nor the GOP leadership seems to have fully grasped how opinion within the party has shifted on defense spending. On shrinking the Pentagon, many tea party Republicans are closer to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party than to their own party’s establishment.

To review: Entitlement spending is largely untouched, and defense spending isn’t the sacred cow it once was. Thus neither party has an incentive to make concessions, at least until the true impact of the cuts is felt. Which will take time.

What I really hate about the sequester is the way it confirms the conventional wisdom that “both sides are wrong.” This is usually the kind of lazy pseudoanalysis that drives me up the wall. But it took both Obama and the Republicans to get us into this mess — and nobody has a clue how to get us out of it.

Washington (CNN) - House Republicans are slamming the White House for not negotiating with them. House Speaker John Boehner told GOP rank-and-file that President Barack Obama was rejecting the House GOP offer and instead working with Senators from both parties to end the shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.

""I'm disappointed that the President has rejected the offer that we put on the table,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. ""I know that he's trying to see which Republican Senator he can pick off in the Senate. I hope that the Senate Republicans stand strong so we can speak with one voice.""



[twitter-follow screen_name='politicalticker'][twitter-follow screen_name='deirdrewalshcnn']

""All eyes are on the Senate,"" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois. ""It doesn't seem like the White House is serious at all about entering negotiations with us until they see what comes out of the Senate. If they get something out of the Senate that's weaker than our negotiated position, it obviously strengthens their position.""

Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, was more blunt.

""The President rejected our deal,"" he said. ""It's up to Senate Republicans to stand up to the President.""

Those Senate Republicans are in the midst of talks with their colleagues across the aisle. A bipartisan group of about 10 Senators, led by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, met Friday afternoon to try to find a way forward in the Senate, according to sources familiar with the meeting.

Collins' plan for a longer extension of the debt limit and government funding has gained some traction. Her proposal would repeal the 2.3% tax on medical devices, which is used to help pay for Obamacare, and give federal agencies greater flexibility to deal with the forced spending cuts known as sequestration.

With the White House's rejection of House Republicans' offer, members will head home to their district for the weekend, many of them angry at what they see as an intransigent administration.

Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, said the President has negotiated in bad faith and that he never intended to reach a deal, only bait and switch.

The Republican caucus has never been more unified than they now are against a ""very bad"" deal between Senate Republicans and the President, he said.

GOP leadership will remain in Washington to continue negotiations, advising their members they could possibly call them back for a vote. As of now, though, no votes are planned, and members will return Monday afternoon.

Unless Congress steps in, some $85 billion in massive spending reductions will hit the federal government, doling out furloughs to much of the nation's 2.1 million federal workforce, experts say.

The cuts coming as a part of the forced spending cuts that will carve out some 9% from non-defense programs and 13% from defense programs. They're part of a larger effort to trim $1.2 trillion from federal deficits over 10 years.

Daniel Werfel, a controller for the Office of Management and Budget, told a Senate panel Thursday that furloughs won't happen until after agencies negotiate with unions, and that's not expected to be finished until after March 1.

After union bargaining, the agencies still need to give employees their official 30 days notice of impending furloughs, realistically pushing most furloughs off until April. However, some non-union employees could face furloughs in March.

Unions usually have the final say on how the furloughs will be implemented, said Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). She said they get to bargain with federal agencies on issues such as how the furloughed days will be spread out.

The unions will also work with agencies to ensure that things such as performance reviews don't reflect work left incomplete due to furloughs.

""We believe that one furlough day is one too many for employees,"" said Kelley, whose group is among those pushing Congress to come up with an alternative to federal budget cuts.

Neither NTEU nor National Federation of Federal Employees have been approached to officially begin the bargaining process over furloughs, both confirmed.

Related: How Washington politics threatens my job

At Thursday's hearing, Werfel said agencies might not be able to avoid furloughs that would reduce essential services. At the Agriculture Department, for example, it's not possible to avoid furloughs that would result in fewer food inspections, because most of the agency's expenses are the salaries and benefits of people who perform those tasks.

""So it becomes a math issue, ultimately,"" he said. ""This is one of the very tangible and clear and significant impacts of sequester: This division within USDA will not be able to make its core mission of sending the inspectors to these locations.""

The exact number of total furloughs planned is still unavailable, since agencies are still deciding how to spread the cuts. It's possible some agencies may yet be able to spare some employees from furloughs or at least minimize days of unpaid leave.

Generally, workers would keep benefits such as health insurance, according to recent guidance from the Office of Personnel Management. But some workers may have to give up more from their paychecks when they return to work after a furlough, if their salary for the pay period wasn't enough to cover health insurance premiums.

The sequester -- a series of blunt, automatic funding cuts across much of the federal budget set to begin March 1 -- was never supposed to go into effect. Instead, the threat that it might was supposed to spur lawmakers to find a smarter way to reduce deficits over the next decade.

The only group that could escape furloughs are some 1,500 presidential appointees, including Cabinet positions, deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries. That's because those jobs are considered 24-hour-a-day positions, said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that advocates for a more efficient federal workforce.

Most of those workers are at the top of the federal pay scale, Stier said.

""It's just craziness,"" he said. ""You're telling the vast bulk of federal employees 'Guess what, you don't know how much money you're going to make.' And in all likelihood, these hard-working people will have to do the same amount of work."""

Samuelson', 'Former Columnist Focusing On Economics', 'March', 'Robert J. Samuelson Wrote A Twice-Weekly Column On Economics. He Retired In September']",Robert Samuelson: A dishonest budget debate,"“The president is in the midst of a charm offensive.”

— The Post, referring to President Obama’s meetings with congressional Republicans

We don’t need a charm offensive; we need a candor offensive. The budget debate’s central reality is that federal retirement programs, led by Social Security and Medicare, are crowding out most other government spending. Until we openly recognize and discuss this, it will be impossible to have a “balanced approach” — to use one of President Obama’s favorite phrases. It’s the math: In fiscal 2012, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and civil service and military retirement cost $1.7 trillion, about half the budget. If they’re off-limits, the burdens on other programs and tax increases grow ever greater.

It’s already happening. The military is shrinking and weakening: The Army is to be cut by 80,000 troops, the Marines by 20,000. As a share of national income, defense spending ($670 billion in 2012) is headed toward its lowest level since 1940. Even now, the Pentagon says budget limits hamper its response to cyberattacks. “Domestic discretionary spending” — a category that includes food inspectors, the FBI, the National Weather Service and many others — faces a similar fate. By 2023, this spending will drop 33 percent as a share of national income, estimates the Congressional Budget Office. Dozens of programs will be squeezed.

Nor will states and localities escape. Federal grants ($607 billion in 2011) will shrink. States’ Medicaid costs will increase with the number of aged and disabled, which represent two-thirds of Medicaid spending. All this will force higher taxes or reduce traditional state and local spending on schools, police, roads and parks.

The budget debate may seem inconclusive, but it’s having pervasive effects. Choices are being made by default. Almost everything is being subordinated to protect retirees. Solicitude for government’s largest constituency undermines the rest of government. This is an immensely important story almost totally ignored by the media. One reason is that it’s happening spontaneously and invisibly: Growing numbers of elderly are simply collecting existing benefits. The media do not excel at covering inertia.

Liberals drive this process by treating Social Security and Medicare as sacrosanct. Do not touch a penny of benefits; these programs are by definition progressive; all recipients are deserving and needy. Only a few brave liberals complain that this dogma threatens programs for the non-aged poor. “None of us wants to impose new burdens on vulnerable seniors,” write economists Harry J. Holzer of Georgetown University and Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution in The Post. But “for how long will we continue to sacrifice investments in our nation’s children and youth ... to spend more and more on the aged?”

Hypocritical conservatives are liberals’ unspoken allies. Despite constant grumbling about entitlements, they lack the courage of their convictions. Consider House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s latest budget plan. From 2014 to 2023, he proposes cutting federal spending by $4.6 trillion. Not a cent comes from Social Security, while Medicare cuts are tiny, about 2 percent. His major Medicare proposal (in effect, a voucher) wouldn’t start until 2024. Most baby boomers escape meaningful benefit cuts. As Holzer and Sawhill fear, most of Ryan’s cuts affect programs for the poor.

What frustrates constructive debate is muddled public opinion. Americans hate deficits but desire more spending and reject higher taxes. In a Pew poll, 87 percent of respondents favored present or greater Social Security spending; only 10 percent backed cuts. Results were similar for 18 of 19 programs, foreign aid being the exception.

Only the occupant of the bully pulpit can yank public opinion back to reality. This requires acknowledging that an aging America needs a new social compact: one recognizing that longer life expectancies justify gradual increases in Social Security’s and Medicare’s eligibility ages; one accepting that sizable numbers of well-off retirees can afford to pay more for their benefits or receive less; one that improves generational fairness by concentrating help for the elderly more on the needy and poor to lighten the burdens — in higher taxes and fewer public services — on workers; and one that limits health costs.

Obama hasn’t talked intelligently or openly about America’s aging. In budget negotiations, the administration has made some proposals (a different inflation adjustment for Social Security benefits, a higher Medicare eligibility age) that broach the subject. But Obama hasn’t put these modest steps into the larger context of social change; nor is it clear how much the administration supports them. It’s true that Republicans should also accept higher taxes — but only after the White House engages retirement spending.

Little is possible while public opinion remains frozen in contradiction. The mistake lies in thinking that the apparent paralysis isn’t policy. It is. Government is being slowly transformed into a vast old-age home, with everything else devalued and degraded.

In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Lew said the hit to the economy would go far beyond the disruption of financial markets that has gotten a lot of attention in recent days.

""Between October 17 and November 1, we have large payments to Medicare providers, Social Security beneficiaries and veterans, as well as salaries for active duty members of the military,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""A failure to raise the debt limit could put timely payment of all of these at risk.""

The statement was one of his most explicit warnings of the problems posed to the public if the debt ceiling isn't raised.

Related: CNN - GOP will propose short-term debt ceiling extension

There are 1.4 active duty members of the military and nearly 800,000 civilian support staff in the Defense Department who are working during the government shutdown.

Lew disputed the claims of some Republicans that there wouldn't be a major problem if the ceiling is not raised soon, and that the Treasury Department can pick and chose which bills to pay to avoid default on U.S. debt and limit the damage to the public.

""The United States should not be put in a position of making such perilous choices for our economy and our citizens,"" he said. ""How can the United States choose whether to send Social Security checks to seniors or pay benefits to our veterans? How can the United States choose whether to provide children with food assistance or meet our obligations to Medicare providers.""

Sen Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the committee, repeated his party's criticisms of the administration's refusal to negotiate on the debt ceiling.

""If the Obama administration won't negotiate on entitlements in the context of the debt ceiling, when will it negotiate?"" he said in his opening remarks.

And other Republican lawmakers said the public is behind their demand that spending be cut before the debt ceiling is increased.

""I think this is 11th time I've been through this discussion about the sky is falling and the earth will erupt,"" said Mike Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming. ""Wyoming families aren't buying these arguments. They're saying you can't spend more than you take in.""

Lew repeated the administration's position that the ceiling has to be raised to cover the spending that Congress has previously approved.

""Those Wyoming families know that after they run up their credit cards, they don't get to ignore it,"" he said. ""They have to pay their bills. The debt limit is just paying our bill.""

Debt ceiling deadline: Stop fixating on Oct. 17

Lew reiterated that by Oct. 17 he will exhaust the special accounting measures he's been taking since May to keep under the debt cap. After that point, without the ability to borrow, the government will run out of the cash it needs to pay all its bills on time. But he cautioned that Oct. 17 is only the best possible estimate.

""It is impossible to predict with accuracy,"" he said. ""That's why Congress needs to act to raise the debt limit sooner rather than later.""

Sen Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who has pushed legislation to mandate that interest on Treasuries be paid before other bills, asked Lew to guarantee that the government does not default on debt.

Related: Who we owe

Toomey said it was ""shocking"" that Lew couldn't give him that assurance.

Lew said any missed payments -- not just those on the debt -- would constitute default and rattle the economy and financial markets.

Economists surveyed by CNNMoney also warned that a recession is very likely if the ceiling is not raised."

Globalization is driving the sinking fortunes of many ordinary Americans.

Prior to World War II, the U.S. economy was largely isolated. It traded with the world much less than rivals like Germany, labor was scarcer and wages were higher for ordinary workers than just about anyplace else.

The New Deal strengthened unions and the post-war growth of manufacturing created a thriving middle class. Competition for workers tended to raise wages in service activities too.

[pullquote]

More On This...

Subsequently, the United States championed freer trade through the WTO. Cheaper ocean freight, then jet travel and now the internet blurred boundaries between national markets.

Combined with the rise of Japan and China, those severely injured U.S. electronics, auto and other manufacturing, and are now eroding employment in many professional services.

An open global economy created broad opportunities for college educated Americans with sophisticated skills in advanced technology, finance and the creative arts—like film making. First National City Bank, a dominant player in New York State, became Citigroup, a dominant force in global finance.

All of this decimated unions and lowered wages for workers with only a high school education or soft college degree, while enriching the relatively few in engineering, finance or other highly technical areas.

The top 1 percent now earn nearly one-fifth of the country’s household income, and the top 10 percent more than half. That’s the most since 1928, and Obama’s policies have made things worse—faster.

In a globalized economy, America has to play its strengths, but during the Obama recovery the international trade deficit has nearly doubled.

Bans on offshore drilling and in parts of Alaska require expensive oil imports, and send purchasing power and high paying jobs to the Middle East and Russia. The flood of manufacturers from China keeps growing, thanks to an undervalued yuan and other subsidies the Administration refuses to address.

Dodd-Frank bank reforms have not stopped reckless and unethical behavior on Wall Street. Witness JP Morgan’s ""London Whale"" and how often that venerable institution and Goldman Sachs are dragged into court these days.

Yet, new regulations have imposed burdensome costs on smaller banks, forcing many to sell out to the Wall Street casinos and permitting the latter to grasp control of more than fifty percent of U.S. bank deposits. The resulting downward pressure on CD rates deprives many older Americans of retirement income, while permitting the barons of Manhattan to continue receiving multi-million dollar bonuses.

ObamaCare is forcing businesses to divide full-time jobs for ordinary workers into part-time positions to avoid expensive health insurance mandates, and those jobs pay less.

Higher taxes on top income earners have hit small businesses the hardest. Financiers, high tech entrepreneurs and movie producers can pass off their salaries as capital gains through loopholes in the tax code. The president rails against that opportunity to enjoy much lower rates than the rest of us, but has done little to fix it.

Meanwhile, small businesses paying marginal rates as high as 60 percent in states with liberal governors like New York, California or Maryland don’t invest and create jobs.

During the Obama recovery, the top one percent has captured 95 percent of the income gains—almost double the average for the Clinton and Bush recoveries.

Obama tells Americans he’s for the middle class. The facts tell another story. The president’s policies are enriching the same folks that support his campaigns—the rich liberals on Wall Street, in the Silicon Valley and in Hollywood."

President Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act

The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Dec. 3-8 among 2,001 adults, finds majorities say it is more important to maintain spending on Social Security and Medicare and programs to help the poor than to take steps to reduce the budget deficit. Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say it is more important to maintain current Social Security and Medicare benefits than to reduce the deficit, while 59% prioritize keeping current levels of spending for programs that help the poor and needy over deficit reduction.

There is greater public support for cutting military spending in order to achieve deficit reduction. About half of Americans (51%) say reducing the deficit is more important than keeping military spending at current levels, while 40% say deficit reduction is more important.

Bad news for the Third Way, Fix the Debt, Kick the Can and all the other Wall Street and Pete Peterson-funded ""think tanks"" out there: they still haven't convinced the American public that the deficit is more important than, well, the American public and its well-being. The latest evidence comes from Pew Furthermore, if we really do need to cut the deficit, the public has strong ideas about how to do just that:There are partisan divides when it comes to helping the needy: 84 percent of Democrats prioritize it, but 55 percent of Republicans say deficit reduction is more important than people being able to, you know, eat, have clothing, shelter. I know, you're shocked.

Yeesh, Third Way can't even convince Republicans. They've also failed in fomenting generational warfare: ""On entitlements, the youngest Americans (ages 18-29) prioritize maintaining Social Security and Medicare benefits over deficit reduction by a 61%-30%.""

As if President Obama hasn't had Social Security and Medicare benefits cuts sitting out there on the negotiating table for every manufactured debt crisis the Republicans come up with. Cantor even says ""the House really is the only one who has consistently engaged in trying to address the spending problem."" As if Democrats haven't agreed to $1.5 trillion in cuts, as if the deficit wasn't actually shrinking.

This time, Obama should take them up on it, at least to the extent of telling them to make him an offer. Take his own offers for cutting the programs off the table and tell them to put theirs out there, since obviously they're not going to bite on his. This time, let Republicans own the cuts to these programs. Make them put their names on them, make them insist that unless they get those cuts, they'll shut down government. There's a template out there already for that. Just ask Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. We all remember how well that worked for Republicans.

Tell President Obama it's the Republicans' turn to own Medicare cuts, and to take the cuts he's offered off the table."

Taxpayer Advocate says 90%25 of families who claimed adoption tax credit in 2012 had returns flagged for review

Nearly 70%25 had at least a partial audit of their tax return%2C the taxpayer advocacy service reports

Change in law made more families eligible for larger refunds

Another day, another headache for the Internal Revenue Service.

This time, the federal agency is being accused of mishandling the tax returns of adoptive families.

A report from the IRS's Taxpayer Advocate Service says that 90% of families who claimed the adoption tax credit during the 2012 filing season had their returns flagged for further review. Nearly 70%t had at least a partial audit of their tax return.

But the majority of the cases where the tax credit was audited — more than 35,000 returns in all — resulted in no changes.

The Taxpayer Advocate report says the IRS's handling of the adoption tax credit was a essentially a nightmare.

""The IRS's misguided procedures, and its failure to adequately adjust these processes when it learned its approach was seriously flawed, have caused significant economic harm to thousands of families who are selflessly trying to improve the lives of vulnerable children,"" said the report.

Among those families are Jake and Elfie Dotson of Clarksville. They've been dealing with the IRS for more than a year, trying to finalize their 2011 tax return.

Jake Doston is expecting a refund of several thousand dollars, which will help offset the $11,000 in fees they paid for the adoption. He says that because the IRS hasn't approved the tax credit, the agency claims the Dotsons still owe taxes.

""The IRS is telling me that I owe them money they haven't paid me, plus interest and penalties,"" he said.

The problem with the tax returns started in 2010, with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often known as ""Obamacare.""

That law changed the way the IRS handled the tax credit for adoptions. It raised the maximum credit to $13,170 per child and made the credit refundable and retroactive. That meant the credit could could boost a family's tax refund by thousands of dollars.

In the past, many families had not qualified for the full credit. But the new rules made more families eligible for larger refunds, said Becky Wilmoth, a registered tax return preparer for Bills Tax Service of Centralia, Ill.

""A lot of people were able to go back and amend their returns from past years,"" said Wilmoth, who specializes in returns for adoptive families.

The new rules meant the total amount of money refunded jumped fourfold.

For the 2009 tax year, 81,430 taxpayers claimed the adoption tax credit, for a total of $280.6 million. For 2010, 110,591 taxpayers claimed $1.2 billion in credits. In 2011, 51,539 taxpayers claimed $668.1 million in credits.

""I don't think they knew there were that many adoptive families out there,"" said Wilmoth.

Wilmoth said most families who had trouble with the IRS didn't get a full-blown audit, including interviews with IRS agents. Instead, they got a review of the paperwork for their adoption tax credit. That still causes a lot of anxiety, she said.

But most families eventually got their tax refunds, with interest. According to the IRS report, the median refund for the adoption tax credit was more than $15,000.

""Yes, they had to wait,"" Wilmoth said. ""But you are also talking about a lot of money.""

An IRS spokeswoman said that in the past, other refundable tax credits had led to fraud. So the agency was trying to prevent that from occurring with the adoption credit.

""The IRS implemented the adoption credit program with an approach that balanced the objective of paying legitimate credits in a timely manner with that of ensuring that claims were accurate,"" Michelle L. Eldridge, chief of National IRS Media Relations in a statement.

""Our experiences and lessons learned from other refundable credits taught us that high dollar credits have high risk and the potential for fraud. We must ensure delivery of the credit to those entitled while protecting the government's interest in minimizing exposure to fraud.""

News of the adoption audits fueled more online criticism of the IRS. The agency already is under fire after it apologized for targeting Tea Party groups and pro-life groups that had applied for tax exemptions. There does not seem to be any political motive behind the adoption credit audits.

Chuck Johnson, president and CEO of the National Council for Adoption, said he thinks the amount of money involved in the refunds was the issue. He also thinks there were fears that some people might misuse the credit.

That didn't prove to be the case. The IRS disallowed less than 2 percent of the total tax credits claimed, according to the Tax Advocate Service report.

""The good news is that the kind of people who adopt children don't try to cheat on their taxes,"" said Johnson.

Holly Spann, the Tennessee representative for the American Adoption Congress, said in an email that she was disappointed to see that ""such a large number of adoptive parents are going through so much unwarranted analysis by the IRS and having their refunds short-changed....""

Adoptive families who had their tax refunds delayed said that complying with the IRS's requirements was complicated.

David French of Columbia, Tenn., a blogger and lawyer for the American Center for Law and Justice, said that he and his wife, Nancy, filed for the adoption credit in 2011, after adopting their daughter from Ethiopia. Over the summer, they received a letter from the IRS requesting more paperwork, including receipts for their expenses.

They were able to send copies of the receipts for their plane tickets as well as the fees they paid to their adoption agency. But most of their expenses while traveling in Africa were paid in cash.

""Even your hotel doesn't take a credit card in Ethiopia,"" he said.

Families who adopt from overseas often run up tens of thousands of dollars in debt to pay for the adoption. Getting the tax credit can make it easier for middle-class families to adopt, said French. The median income for taxpayers who got the adoption credit was $64,000.

The adoption tax credit is no longer refundable, which has made it easier for taxpayers who claimed the credit for 2012. Wilmoth said only two of her clients have had their credits reviewed this year.

That may change if the credit becomes refundable in the future. Senators Bob Casey, D-Pa., and Mary Landrieu, D-La., along with Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, introduced the Adoption Tax Credit Refundability Act of 2013 on Thursday, to make that happen.

Jake Dotson said he'd just like to see his troubles with the IRS be over. He said most people already have a negative view of the agency, because no one likes to pay taxes. The recent controversies have made things worse.

""Nobody trusts them,"" he said.

That is the House Republicans’ brilliant plan in their last-ditch effort to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act. It is a plan that threatens to grind the government to a halt and wreak havoc on the economy.

If they can’t take over Washington, they’ll shut it down. It’s their way or no way. All or nothing.

This is what has become of a party hijacked by zealots.

It would be tempting to blame all Republicans for this absurdity, but that would be unfair. There are still Republicans who are interested in good governance, but they’re being dragged to the nether regions of nonsensical policy making by younger, more ideological members of Congress, many from safely gerrymandered districts that form virtual echo chambers of irrationality.

The old guard has warned against the recklessness of the tactics of far-right House Republicans.

John McCain told CNN on Thursday: “In the United States Senate, we will not repeal, or defund, Obamacare. We will not. And to think we can is not rational.”"

http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/11/news/economy/disability-payments/index.html,2013-04-11 00:00:00,['Steve Hargreaves'],Disability claims skyrocket: Here's why,"The number of Americans getting some type of disability check from the federal government is soaring.

Since 2003, there's been a 29% jump in Americans with little or no work experience getting disability payments, according to the Social Security Administration. Over the same time, there's been a 44% increase in disability claims by people formerly in the workplace.

Disability claims among veterans are up 28% since 2008, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

All told, the federal government spent nearly $250 billion in 2011 paying more than 23 million Americans some type of disability claim. That's about 7% of the overall population, and 16% of the workforce.

Those numbers don't even include people out on worker compensation claims -- which are mostly paid for by private companies. Five states also offer short term disability, and there are nearly 1 million workers receiving private disability insurance.

But the Social Security-administered program that pays disability claims will likely run out of money by 2016, forcing politicians to either cut Social Security benefits, raise taxes or, most likely, dip into general Social Security funds for the money.

There are many reasons for the increase in disability claims, most notably the recession, an aging population, advances in medical technology and a decade of war.

The recession: The economic downturn in 2008 and early 2009 is thought to be the major reason for the jump in disability payments to people who were formerly working.

""With every recession, we see a rise in the number of applicants,"" said Andrew Houtenville, an economics professor at the University of New Hampshire's Institute on Disability. ""People are looking for options in terms of income support.""

During the 2001 recession, disability claims from those who used to have a steady job shot up 13%, said Barry Lundquist, president of the Council for Disability Awareness, an insurance-industry funded organization. The growth in claims slowed during the subsequent boom years, but then skyrocketed during the most recent recession. In 2009, claims jumped 21%.

Lundquist said it is simplistic to characterize the jump in claims as people simply looking to substitute disability payments for unemployment.

""Most people really do want to work,"" said Lundquist.

But for some, it's really just not an option.

Aging population: The U.S. population has risen about 8% since 2003. In addition to more people, the population is also getting older as the baby boomers retire.

Older people tend to have more disability issues. And if someone in their late 50s or early 60s gets laid off and also has some sort of injury, they know it's going to be hard for them to find another job.

Still, Houtenville noted that disability claims are up among all age groups.

Welfare reform: Efforts in the 1990s to reform the nation's welfare laws had the perverse effect of pushing more people onto the Social Security program for people with little work history. That has continued.

States and municipalities actually set up screening centers to test welfare recipients for disabilities, said John O'Neill, director of employment and disability research at the Kessler Foundation, a non-profit focused on disability issues. If any were found, state workers helped the people apply for federal disability benefits.

""They shifted their costs onto the federal government,"" said O'Neill.

Medical advances: This is particularly relevant for military veterans. Thanks to better surgical techniques -- and body armor -- soldiers are ten times as likely to survive today's wars, according to the Veterans Administration. But soldiers often come home with severe injuries.

The recent decision to recognize post traumatic stress disorder as a disability has also lifted the number of benefits claims. The Veterans Administration noted that illnesses tied to the cancer-causing chemical defoliant Agent Orange used in Vietnam are also now viewed as a disability.

But medical advances aren't just helping soldiers. Premature babies have a better chance of living now, as are people who have a heart attack or stroke. However, surviving doesn't mean that people are entirely symptom-free.

""We're not just living longer, but we're living disabled longer as well,"" said Daniel Steenerson, president of Disability Insurance Services, a company what works with both insurance firms and disabled people.

Need for reform: Some of the increases in disability payments are arguably a good thing - like more veterans being covered.

But Houtenville said the Social Security disability program for former workers could be improved if there also was a short term disability program that encouraged people to return to work.

An increase in job training and education programs for the disabled would also help."

After the failure of the House Republican leadership to find enough support for its latest proposal to end the fiscal crisis, the Senate’s Democratic and Republican leaders immediately restarted negotiations to find a bipartisan path forward. A spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Mr. Reid was “optimistic that an agreement is within reach” with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.

With so little time left, chances rose that a resolution would not be approved by Congress and sent to President Obama before Thursday, when the government is left with only its cash on hand to pay the nation’s bills.

http://news.yahoo.com/republican-infighting-full-display-u-senate-floor-234458260--business.html,,[],Republican infighting on full display on U.S. Senate floor,"By Rachelle Younglai WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican infighting took a nasty turn in the U.S. Senate on Thursday with Senator Bob Corker accusing fellow conservative Ted Cruz of using the looming fiscal deadline for self-promotion and to endear himself further with Tea Party groups. Congress has four days left to pass a spending bill to keep the government running. But traditional arguments between Republicans and Democrats, and bickering within the Republican Party have delayed action for days. While the unusual floor fight between senators from the same party focused on one temporary spending bill, it highlighted the intra-party fights raging among Republicans over everything from national security surveillance to immigration reform and how deeply to cut into government social safety-net programs. Corker, a Tennessee Republican, accused Cruz and fellow conservative Tea Party-backed Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah of not wanting to vote on legislation on Thursday night because they wished to maximize their public exposure on Friday. They ""have sent out emails around the world and turned this into a show possibly, and therefore they want people around the world to watch maybe them and others on the Senate floor,"" Corker said on the Senate floor. ""That is taking priority over getting legislation back to the House so they can take action before the country's government shuts down,"" Corker said. Cruz's office defended the delay and said it was better that the debate play out in the full light of day so the American people know exactly what is happening. ""America will be watching closely which senators vote to allow Democrats to fully fund Obamacare, and the vote should be carried out in the open for all to see,"" Cruz's office said. Earlier this week, Cruz, a first-term senator from Texas, spent 21 hours and 19 minutes talking on the Senate floor in what many Republican lawmakers viewed as a publicity stunt to rail against President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, popularly known as 'Obamacare.' Although Cruz repeatedly warned his Republican colleagues that a vote to advance the Senate's budget bill was akin to supporting Obamacare, he later voted in favor of advancing the legislation. DISAGREEMENT OVER STRATEGY Corker questioned Cruz's marathon anti-Obamacare speech, which looked like a filibuster that senators normally use to block legislation. ""I don't think ever in the history of the Senate that we've had a 21-hour filibuster and then the person carrying out the filibuster voted for the issue they were filibustering,"" said Corker. Many Republicans disagree with Cruz's and Lee's strategy of using the threat of a government shutdown to stop funding Obamacare, since they do not have the votes to approve the bill in the Democratic-controlled Senate and Obama has said he will veto it. But pressure from the two senators as well as outside groups affiliated with the conservative Tea Party movement led the Republican-led House to pass a spending bill that included a provision to defund Obamacare. ""It's my understanding that the reason you don't want to send a bill over to the House who could possibly put in place some very good policies for us here, is that you want the American people and the outside groups that you've been in contact with to be able to watch us tomorrow,"" Corker said. The Senate is expected to vote on Friday on a bill to keep the government funded through mid-November. The legislation will then go back to the House where Republicans are expected to attach other Republican-friendly provisions. (Reporting by Rachelle Younglai; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

The charge that ObamaCare is driving Americans into part-time work is one of the central claims that opponents make in arguing for the law to be defunded or delayed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, reiterated the claim during his 21-hour floor speech against ObamaCare this week.

But the president, while promoting the law to a friendly audience in suburban Washington, brushed off the argument.

""Most of the stories you'll hear about how ObamaCare just can't work, they're just not based on fact,"" Obama said.

He continued: ""They said this would be a disaster in terms of jobs. There's no widespread evidence that the Affordable Care Act is hurting jobs. ... Reforming health care's going to help the economy over the long-term.""

More On This...

The claim flies in the face of what union leaders have been telling the White House and Democratic lawmakers for months.

In a widely noted letter to Democratic leaders over the summer, the heads of the Teamsters and other unions argued that ""perverse incentives"" were hurting jobs.

Unless the law is changed, they wrote, ""the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40-hour workweek that is the backbone of the American middle-class.""

They, and employers across the country, point to provisions of the law that would require businesses with 50 or more full-time workers to provide health insurance to those workers. The argument is that businesses are scrambling, then, to make more workers qualify as part-time, by reducing their hours to fewer than 30 a week.

""Numerous employers have begun to cut workers' hours to avoid this obligation, and many of them are doing so openly,"" the union leaders wrote.

The Obama administration, in a surprise move, delayed the employer mandate by a year. But that hasn't stopped businesses from cutting hours.

Investor's Business Daily has compiled a list of more than 300 employers that have cut worker hours or staffing levels, many as recently as this month.

Among them was SeaWorld, in Florida, cutting back part-time hours from 32 to 28 per week.

The Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday on a South Carolina cleaning business claiming it will hire only part-time workers in order to stay under the 50-worker threshold.

Obama was promoting the law in Maryland in advance of the Oct. 1 launch of the so-called insurance ""exchanges."" These are regulated marketplaces where Americans will be able to shop for approved insurance plans -- enrollment begins Tuesday.

Obama tried to counter ""misinformation"" about the law, and noted: ""If you already have health care, you don't have to do anything."""

And by 94, the cumulative loss would be more than $8,300, according to the center’s calculations. But if she lived until 95, she would get the privilege of the second increase, also equivalent to 5 percent of the average benefit check. Her monthly check would climb back to the levels under the current law if she lived until 104, but by then, she would have lost about $10,200 in total income.

Of course, since the bump-up is a flat amount, some people with lower benefits might receive a bigger increase than they would under the current system, a senior administration official from the White House explained. Conversely, the bump-up offsets a smaller portion of the cut when benefits are higher.

This is not a popular move. According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, 51 percent of respondents opposed changing the way Social Security benefits are calculated so that benefits increase at a slower rate, while 37 percent supported such a change (11 percent had no opinion). The survey said there were no partisan differences, but among people 65 and older opposition was 64 percent.

The “three-legged stool” of retirement — that is, pensions, savings and Social Security — has already become more of a lopsided two-legged stool, because pensions have been waning for years. And the Social Security leg is providing most of the support for many retirees: about 43 percent of single people and 22 percent of married couples rely on the benefits for more than 90 percent of their income, the Social Security Administration says. More than half of couples and 73 percent of singles draw more than half their income from the program.

The new measure of inflation would alter the way their benefits increase. Right now, Social Security is pegged to the C.P.I.-W, which tracks the typical purchases of a sample of urban wage and clerical workers, but does not include retirees. (Social Security uses this index because it was the only one that existed when the benefits were first adjusted for inflation.) The chained C.P.I.-U includes some retirees.

The chained C.P.I. would more broadly account for how people change their buying habits when prices rise, substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones. When the price of Porterhouse steak increases, the current index considers that a consumer can switch to a cheaper cut, as explained in an AARP paper. But the chained index would account for substitution between category types. So instead of buying cheaper beef, the consumer might switch to chicken.

But critics argue that the elderly and disabled do not have the ability to substitute as much as other consumers. “When so much of their budget goes toward health care expenses,” said Cristina Martin Firvida, director of financial security at AARP, “you are not going to choose to replace a hip treatment with another treatment just because it is cheaper. There is a limit for substitution with older people. We already account for a great deal of it in the current calculation.”"

With his hard line, Mr. Boehner reaffirmed that the stalemate with the White House over the six-day-old government shutdown was now compounded by an even more economically risky fight over raising the government’s borrowing limit by Oct. 17 to pay for bills already incurred.

Most of the government remains shuttered with no end in sight, and markets and businesses are growing increasingly fretful over the chaos that could result from the first government default on its debt."
